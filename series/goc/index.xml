<p>The Commonwealth Bank was founded 1642 as the Royal Bank in <a href="/lola/">Lola</a>, and is the fifth oldest bank in the world.</p>
<p>Most banks in Vekllei are institutional or industrial, since the average Vekllei person is unmoneyed and, in a conventional definition, unbanked. Nonetheless, Vekllei maintains several commercial banks under the Bank of Vekllei umbrella, tasked primarily with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cashing and underwriting White and Blue bonds.</li>
<li>Selling government and financial (bureau) bonds internationally.</li>
<li>International placement and borrowing services.</li>
<li>Trading, settling and selling foreign currencies.</li>

<p>The <span class="fi fi-min-post fis"></span>  <strong>Commonwealth Postal Service</strong> (commonly known as <em>Commonwealth Post</em> or <em>the Post</em>) is the national postal carrier of <a class="slink"  style="color: var(--color-vekllei); background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-vekllei) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/world/vekllei/"><span class="fi fi-com"></span> Vekllei</a>. It handles almost all postage in the country, and delivers nearly 50 million pieces of mail daily. The Post is one of the oldest institutions of its kind in Vekllei, and its history can be traced to the founding of the Royal Mail Corporation in 1422 in <a class="slink" style="color: rgb(88, 90, 190); background: color-mix(in srgb, rgb(88, 90, 190) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/world/vekllei/volcanic/oslola/"><span class="fi fi-oslola"></span> Oslola</a>, when it served as a courier system between the Oslolan Kingdom and its largely mercenary military force. In 1742, it was formalised as a modern postal system available to the civilian public, and was reformed in the postwar period to provide a variety of services available to all Commonwealth residents.</p>
<p>Next to <a class="slink" style="color: rgb(245, 60, 89); background: color-mix(in srgb, rgb(245, 60, 89) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/society/industry/state/air/"><span class="fi fi-min-air fis"></span> Commonwealth Airways</a>, the Post is perhaps Vekllei&rsquo;s most visible organisation overseas. For many foreigners, Commonwealth Post cargo aircraft may be the closest they ever come to seeing the obscure Atlantic country for themselves. For Vekllei residents, the historic organisation is a living relic of the country&rsquo;s diverse and ancient history, and its evolution as a company reflects Vekllei&rsquo;s own development under the historic kingdoms, colonial occupation, and federal independence.</p>
<p>Today, the Post is headquartered in <a class="slink" style="color: rgb(88, 90, 190); background: color-mix(in srgb, rgb(88, 90, 190) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/world/vekllei/volcanic/oslola/"><span class="fi fi-oslola"></span> Oslola</a> across a dozen or so city blocks dedicated to administration, manufacturing, vehicle storage and Vekllei&rsquo;s General Post Office. There are over 6,400 post offices across Vekllei today, connecting all 68 of its far-flung <a href="/republics/">republics</a>. Oslola is also home to the <a class="slink" style="color: rgb(76, 146, 219); background: color-mix(in srgb, rgb(76, 146, 219) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/world/countries/un/"><span class="fi fi-un"></span> United Nations</a> Universal Postal Union, the body responsible for coordinating international postage.</p>

<p>Although most Vekllei republics have had independent or foreign postal services throughout their histories, the Post as a continuous institution was founded in 1422 by the Desimou VII, King of <a class="slink" style="color: rgb(88, 90, 190); background: color-mix(in srgb, rgb(88, 90, 190) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/world/vekllei/volcanic/oslola/"><span class="fi fi-oslola"></span> Oslola</a>, in the late Period of Rest. During this time, the lords of Oslola had established significant mercantile holdings across the North Atlantic, and had developed reliable systems of trade throughout Ireland and <a class="slink" style="color: rgb(200, 16, 47); background: color-mix(in srgb, rgb(200, 16, 47) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/world/countries/denmark/"><span class="fi fi-dk"></span> Denmark</a>. The Royal Mail of Oslola was first established as a royal communications organ that sought to ensure stability of Desimou rule across its North Atlantic Empire. In this period, the Mail consisted of a handful of messengers attached to the feudal military apparatus of the Vekllei monarchy.</p>

<p>The Royal Mail would not come to resemble a conventional civilian postal service until 1652, when the Kingdom expanded postal contracts to the privy councils of the <a class="slink" style="color: rgb(67, 101, 187); background: color-mix(in srgb, rgb(67, 101, 187) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/world/vekllei/volcanic/aismious/"><span class="fi fi-fo"></span> Aismious</a> and <a class="slink" style="color: rgb(39, 126, 72); background: color-mix(in srgb, rgb(39, 126, 72) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/world/vekllei/arctic/kala/"><span class="fi fi-kala"></span> Kala</a> territories. It was not until nearly a century later, in 1742, that company services were opened to all land-owning Oslolans, and the Mail came to resemble its contemporary mandate. During Oslola&rsquo;s colonisation as part of the British Atlantic Territories, it operated as the Royal Mail Service, a name it retained in independence.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Postal Service was established in 2015, at the founding of the 2nd Vekllei Federal Republic and 4th Commonwealth. It consolidated existing mail services across the republics, and replaced British services that operated during occupation. In 2017, the first year of independence, Mi Miou was elected as the world&rsquo;s first female Postmistress General. The postwar period of the Post has been marked by a rapid expansion of services in Vekllei and abroad. World Post, the international for-profit arm of the Post, was established in 2034.</p>

<p>Commonwealth Post offers universal service to Vekllei people, delivering all postage anywhere in the world or, indeed, beyond it. It maintains 6,424 post offices across Vekllei, including its antarctic and peripheral territories. The Post&rsquo;s first lunar post office opened in 2059. In addition to its domestic monopoly, the Post contributes nearly VK❦ 2.6 trillion each year towards the Commonwealth Sovereign Wealth Corporation through its international postage and courier services abroad, under the name World Post.</p>

<p>The Post aims to provide next-day delivery during weekdays in zero-code (republic) regions. Overnight delivery is also generally available between larger Commonwealth <a href="/republics/">republics</a>. Most Lunar territories are available on Mondays and Fridays, and other territories are available according to the Post&rsquo;s region table.</p>
<p>Although Vekllei people do not pay to post items, stamps are affixed with coloured squares called <em>chromacodes</em> which are used in the automatic sorting machines common in the country. International postage uses traditional stamps with price listed, and franking is used for tracking and identification.</p>
<h3 id="special-delivery">
  Special Delivery

<p>Special, commercial and industrial postage is managed by the Office of Special Postage through certain sorting facilities and a dedicated postal network. Regular business post is funnelled through regular daily service, but hazardous, oversized and dangerous goods are accepted by special post offices able to accept them. The Post does not provide special services for regular residential or courier delivery.</p>

<p>Commonwealth Post is best known overseas as the <strong>World Post</strong>, which offers services for foreign customers. Like domestic postal systems in other countries, the World Post offers flat rates for delivery anywhere in the world, priced according to size and weight. In addition, its sister company <strong>Universal Express</strong> offers next-day weekday delivery in certain markets. Most employees of the World Post and Universal Express are foreign workers paid a regular salary or banking labour-hours for immigration to Vekllei. Unlike domestic service, the World Post and Universal Express often use private courier contracts to fulfil orders.</p>

<p>In addition to being one of the oldest active postal organisations in the world, Commonwealth Post is among the busiest, since physical post has scarcely been displaced by the telephone in the country. Even without the Post&rsquo;s international services, domestic mail each day can exceed 12 million pieces &ndash; enough for 1 in 2 people, including commercial mail and periodicals.</p>

<p>As is typical for <a href="/state-industry/">government-owned corporations</a> in Vekllei, the Post alleviates the pressure of daily service through its vertically-integrated infrastructure improved by automatic (automen vehicles) and permanent fixtures (pneumatic systems and automatic sorting/franking machines). It is precisely this commitment to infrastructure that makes the Post so visible in daily life, and contributes to its ongoing cultural relevance among Vekllei people.</p>

<p>Commonwealth Post employs 58,200 people full-time across its various offices, and nearly 200,000 automen in various roles. Although the Post does retain a staff of postmen and couriers, most urban daily service is now provided by automatic vehicles and sorting, which account for nearly half of the total automen owned by the organisation. Most Vekllei people are served by post offices rather than home delivery.</p>
<p>The majority of Post employees are involved in the running of the organisation &ndash; mostly as clerks, engineers, and administrators. Around 10,000 postmen are employed by the Mail in daily delivery, called &ldquo;posties&rdquo;. There are around 8,000 postal routes in the country.</p>
<p>Although at first glance the number of automen dramatically exceeds demand, the total count is misleading &ndash; most automen with the company are integrated into the infrastructure of its sorting centres and post offices, and very few are traditionally autonomous robots commonly seen in public in Vekllei. Only about 8,000 automen are employed in physical mail delivery.</p>
<p>There are 16,220 post boxes in Vekllei, which are iconic for their red and gold paint and intricate detailing.</p>

<p>The unique challenges of Vekllei&rsquo;s disparate and diverse geography have necessitated a unique inventory of vehicles, some of which have became iconic in Vekllei and overseas.

  Overview
  <a class="anchor" href="#overview">#</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Vekllei National Rail (VNR)</strong> is a catch-all term for bureau-backed, state-owned rail operators of Vekllei. In casual use, it refers to the Vekllei National Railway A.r.R. and its sister companies, like Vekllei Metro, which are structured within the service-oriented Railways Bureau. More precisely, Vekllei National Rail encompasses several different bureaus that operate, design, maintain and communicate rail service in the country, which itself is further included under the Transport Requisite of the Vekllei Government.</p>
<p>Like most critical organisations of Vekllei, the structure and directorship of Vekllei National Rail is complex, but can be simplified by understanding that all rail transport in the country is ultimately the responsibility of an organisation called Vekllei National Rail, and it is towards this organ that this article is addressed. Today, the National Rail operates nearly 20,000km of track, indicating the density of the rail service it provides, and services nearly 20 million people each day through its network. It is administered and operated by the <a class="slink" style="color: var(--color-commons); background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-commons) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/society/state/government/ministries/commons/bureau-of-rail/"><span class="fi fi-min-commons fis"></span> Bureau of Rail</a>.</p>
<h3 id="introduction">
  Introduction
  <a class="anchor" href="#introduction">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Since nationalisation of the private Vekllei rail companies in 1925, the structure and reach of Vekllei National Rail has changed several times. Operated as a for-profit enterprise at a historical loss, the National Rail&rsquo;s history of service is reflected in the variety of trains and track gauges it maintains.</p>
<p>Vekllei is unique in the density of its rail, a feature of deliberate postwar city planning and the Home Island&rsquo;s history as an industrial port city-state. Very few Vekllei people own automobiles, and trains remain by far the most common method of travel in the country. Because of this, the rail network in metropolitan areas is extraordinarily dense, and is designed to offer access to nearly every residence in urban areas. This fact also explains the presence of dedicated rail lines to small towns and villages that would otherwise not justify their maintenance. As visible on the map above, the passenger rail network in Vekllei is unsurpassed in its density, which contributes to the dependence Vekllei people have on their trains.</p>

<p>Similarly, almost all freight is run along rails of varying gauges. These range from conventional freight trains at standard gauge, to municipal delivery trains at metre guage, and even narrow gauges for moving freight and equipment within large factory complexes. Most major stores and grocers are arranged along freight lines with dedicated sidings, or have their own narrow-gauge tracks dedicated to their use.</p>
<p>Unusually, Vekllei National Rail is legally absolved of all non-rail transport, and possesses no busses or ferries for public use, which are operated and maintained by dedicated adjacent bureaus.</p>
<h3 id="history">
  History
  <a class="anchor" href="#history">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Although Vekllei has used wagonways since the 18th Century and developed horse-drawn railways for industrial transport in its ports, the first passenger rail line in Vekllei was founded in 1855 by the Pharos Rail Company.</p>
<p>The history of rail in Vekllei can be summarised in three key eras of development.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early Development and expansion</strong>, from early service in 1855.</li>
<li><strong>Late Junta/Prewar nationalisation</strong>, from nationalisation in 1925.</li>
<li><strong>Postwar refounding and development</strong>, since independence in 2015.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the foundation of VNR after nationalisation, rail in Vekllei has seen the scale of its passenger rail networks quadruple in size. It is internationally regarded for its safety and reliability.</p>
<h4 id="early-development">
  Early Development
  <a class="anchor" href="#early-development">#</a>
</h4>
<p>The first railways in Vekllei developed alongside its ports, as Vekllei&rsquo;s position as an intermediary free port between Europe and the Americas rapidly developed Vekllei&rsquo;s industrial base. Although the earliest internal rail wagons were pulled by horses, primitive steam locomotives had modernised most ports by the early 19th Century.</p>
<p>The first passenger rail line opened in 1855 between <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/pharos/">Pharos</a> and the present-day borough of Little Vekllei to alleviate the expense of moving goods from the <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/pharos/#port-of-pharos">Port of Pharos</a> to established settlement further inland. The original line was only a few kilometres long, but was extended in 1858 and again in 1872. By this time, several other lines had been established under private rail companies, including passenger services between Vekllei Proper and Little Vekllei, as well as the beginnings of the Montre-Vekllei Railroad.</p>
<p>By the beginning of the 20th Century, Vekllei had a half-dozen major railroad companies, and dozens other limited/local services provided by private operators or their municipality. This saw a massive increase in both the movement of freight and ridership, and helped entrench Vekllei&rsquo;s position as a stopover port city for transatlantic freight and passage.</p>
<h4 id="nationalisation">
  Nationalisation
  <a class="anchor" href="#nationalisation">#</a>
</h4>
<p>The early 20th Century was marked by an exponential increase in ridership, which saw a proliferation of new railroads across the Home Islands. Metropolitan and suburban lines during this period were characterised by overcrowding, poor reliability and irregular service. These factors, in addition to the growing economic power of rail barons in the country, saw the Atlantic Junta (known as the Crown) move to nationalise all metropolitan and intercity passenger rail service in 1925 as the Vekllei National Rail Company (VNC).</p>
<p>The centralisation of Vekllei rail accompanied standardisation of its commuter track gauge, which improved travel times across the country. The VNC period was characterised by reliable investment and a commitment to modernisation of rail in the country. By the late 20th Century, the Vekllei Metropolitan Underground was widely regarded as one of the most beautiful subway systems in the world.</p>
<p>In the late 1980s, VNC started work on what would eventually become the Vekllei-Montre bullet train. The programme overran its cost estimates and was delayed several times, and was not completed until 2004, shortly before the Atomic War.</p>
<h4 id="postwar-development">
  Postwar Development
  <a class="anchor" href="#postwar-development">#</a>
</h4>
<p>National Rail Company assets that had been operated by the occupation Vekllei Provisional Government were transferred to the Vekllei Interim Government in 2015 and reestablished as Vekllei National Rail (VNR) in 2018. The Floral Period has been marked by steady growth in ridership and the scale of its network. The organisation also invests heavily into the development of new locomotives and EMUs, culminating in 2047 with the announcement of the Vekllei East Coast Maglev Scheme, which are the fastest commuter trains in the world.</p>

<p>In 2055, VNR celebrated &ldquo;250 years of rail,&rdquo; and its livery and staff uniforms were overhauled to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>Today, VNR represents the sole means of medium/long-distance transport for over 80% of Vekllei commuters, indicating its continuous status as a monopoly of travel, not just rail, in the country.</p>
<h3 id="structure">
  Structure
  <a class="anchor" href="#structure">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Vekllei National Rail is an organ of the Transport Requisite of the Vekllei Government (A.r.R., or <em>requoisesiasn amourisocietie resmesnghet</em>) as several individual state requisite bureaus, which in turn are charged with different transport companies. Although its structure in Vekllei might be analogous to a government ministry abroad, it functions in practice more like a state-owned enterprise with private subsidiaries. It is not a state-run corporation, and maintains seperate accounting.</p>
<p>Vekllei National Rail is administered through three State Requisites: the Vekllei National Rail itself including all regular operations and rail service, the National Rail Insurance Scheme which finances construction through Government White Bonds, and the Rail Safety Commission.</p>

<p>Access to public transport is considered a &ldquo;critical luxury&rdquo; of the Vekllei state (the Vekllei turn-of-phrase for essential state services) and, by extension, the functioning of its society. By design, it makes no profit, and is subsidised entirely by the Transport Requisite of the Vekllei Government and various independent transport bureaus for the benefit of any Vekllei person. Even prior to the war and investment of the Floral Period, Vekllei&rsquo;s public transport was widely regarded as among the finest of any network in the world thanks to its impeccable safety record, timeliness, and comprehensive coverage.</p>

<p>Rail transport contributes tremendously to the national culture and common affection for Vekllei&rsquo;s public institutions. It is also commonly percieved as a triumph of the postwar floral Period, despite rail history in Vekllei dating back hundreds of years prior. The ongoing expansion of the VNR network and renovation of stations and railhubs commands attention internationally, which is watching Vekllei celebrate its golden age of rail.</p>
<h3 id="national-rail">
  National Rail
  <a class="anchor" href="#national-rail">#</a>
</h3>
<p>National rail access is generally provided directly by Vekllei National Railway A.r.R. through a branch office dependent on the location. The Home Islands are served by VNR Atlantic, whereas <a class="slink" style="color: rgb(39, 126, 72); background: color-mix(in srgb, rgb(39, 126, 72) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/world/vekllei/arctic/kala/"><span class="fi fi-kala"></span> Kala</a> is served by VNR Overseas. The Home Islands house thousands of rural villages outside of urban metropolitan service, and Vekllei&rsquo;s dependence on rail transportatiion demands their inclusion in the VNR network. As such, almost every village in Vekllei has a rail line or interurban tramway, and villages as small as 20 persons see daily service to the capital.</p>
<h3 id="metropolitan-service--subways">
  Metropolitan Service &amp; Subways
  <a class="anchor" href="#metropolitan-service--subways">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The majority of VNR&rsquo;s ~10,000 trains per day run in metro or subway services throughout Vekllei urban and interurban routes. These lines are primarily serviced by the EMU workhorses of the VNR fleet, particularly 56 and 59-Series trainsets. In urban centers, VNR service is frequent enough to be unscheduled, with trains arriving every other minute or so.</p>
<p>The majority of Vekllei&rsquo;s underground metro network has been automated by Automatic Train Control, an industrial automan system that allows for driverless trains. Although still serviced by VNR platform staff with training to stop the train in emergencies, Vekllei&rsquo;s automatic metros are otherwise entirely driverless. VNR Overseas metros in Kala and the Kalina Isles retain drivers.</p>
<h3 id="tramways">
  Tramways
  <a class="anchor" href="#tramways">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Vekllei operates a variety of trams and streetcars, including double-decker street-level units in the capital region and so-called &ldquo;fast trams&rdquo; (inter-urban cars) outside of the cities. Depending on the make and route of the tramway, they may be grade-seperated or integrated into streets. Their ubuquity in urban areas has caused observers to regard them as the principle method of transport in the country, second only to the bicycle.</p>
<h3 id="freight">
  Freight
  <a class="anchor" href="#freight">#</a>
</h3>
<p>VNR&rsquo;s main freight lines run mostly on a seperate gauge and network, and are composed of several companies that operate regionally across a variety of locomotive types and industries. These include traditional freight locomotives and long/short cars, as well as freight trams and wagons used to transport goods around and between factories.</p>

It is the crown jewel of Vekllei&rsquo;s insolvent organs, whose thin profit margins and charming inefficiencies are tolerated and even encouraged in this society which subsidises social benefit above all else.</span>
</blockquote>

<p>Nearly 17 million people per day commute via VNR&rsquo;s networks each day, making up a majority of the Vekllei population. In this sense, VNR&rsquo;s quality of operations affects the Vekllei person more than the quality of their government. In addition to commuter service, VNR automatic freight transit systems are the lifeblood of all industry and commerce in the country, and are regulated directly as a state requisite for their critical importance to the functioning of Vekllei society.</p>

<p>VNR operates 2,114 stations across the Home Islands, which vary from uncovered concrete platforms to tremendous terminus complexes that cover multiple city blocks. The largest station in the country, Vekllei Central, sees over 1 million people per day pass through its gates.</p>
<p>Vekllei&rsquo;s stations are well-regarded for the beauty and decoration overseas. As part of the Millenia Rail campaign in the mid-21st Century, VNR initiated a dramatic overhaul of its passenger infrastructure, restoring heritage-listed station interiors and renovating much of the early postwar metro construction with murals, new lighting, enlarged caverns and shafts, and improved safety features. The cleanliness and safety of Vekllei National Railway is a great point of pride in the country, and in part justifies VNR&rsquo;s tremendous fiscal losses in daily operation.</p>
<p>VNR services are mostly unticketed, and as a Vekllei industry, are free to ride.</p>

<p>VNR employs 65,240 people, which include roles ranging from locomotive engineers and platform staff to editors of rail enthusiast periodicals. It is also one of the largest employers of 12-16 year olds in the country, via its Station Apprentice programme, unique among organisations of its size.</p>
<p>The organisation is administered by the President of the Rail Central Office, which is responsible to the Transport Requisite and the Palace of Rail. VNR has a close relationship with bureau and petty-bureau coachbuilders, and wields considerable power in Vekllei&rsquo;s heavy industries as a major manufacturing partner.</p>

<p>Vekllei National Rail is perhaps unsurpassed in its variety of trainsets and their length of service. An unofficial policy of preservation has ensured that every unit type since the 1980s has seen an ongoing minor presence in current service. VNR rarely retires a trainset completely &ndash; in keeping with the contemporary cultural-political valuation of machines, a few units of each model are retained on various lines for their historical and technical significance. This includes steam locomotives, which continue to operate regular passengers service on some routes.</p>
<p>The backbone of the contemporary Vekllei rail fleet is the Electric Multiple Units (EMUs), which are designated by their year of manufacture.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> In particular, the 56 and 59-Series trainsets make up the majority of EMUs in service today, as they exclusively populate primary commuter lines in Vekllei&rsquo;s southwest. VNR also retains Diesel Multiple Units (DMUs) in its long-haul cold-weather routes, particularly in the Afouisneh region and Kala.</p>
<p>VNR pioneered super-conductive maglev transport for mass consumption, and its SC3 trainsets are the fastest in regular service in the world today, reaching nearly 750km/h in places. Its slowest locomotive, the T400 2-6-2 steam locomotive <em>Small Movements</em> built in 1928, averages just 30km/h on its tourist route in rural Krafla. VNR is also experimenting with nuclear-powered trainsets, but none have so far entered public testing.</p>
