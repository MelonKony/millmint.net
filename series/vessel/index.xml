They serve with the Commonwealth, Arctic and Antarctic fleets to provide air defence and escort capabilities for naval task groups. With a displacement of 8,500 tons and a length of 160 meters, the ship is equipped to operate independently in contested maritime environments. Its production has been succeeded by the <a href="/swordfish-class/"><em>Swordfish</em></a> class.</p>
<p>Propelled by a <a href="/nmpr/"><em>Vampire</em></a> marine nuclear power plant, the Baker-class can maintain a speed of 35 knots, making it among the fastest large Vekllei warships. The crew complement of 320 personnel includes a mix of officers and enlisted sailors trained in various combat and support roles. The class is also equipped with a hanger capable of stowing two naval aviation helijets for anti-submarine and surface combat roles.</p>
<p>Armament includes the No. 3 <em>Rackham</em> air defence system, utilising its powerful radar dome and to intercept aerial threats at medium ranges. A refit in the 2050s also equipped the class with upgraded dual-launchers for newer No. 6 <em>Shemozzle</em> anti-ship missiles, enhancing its ability to engage large surface targets. For close-range defence, the Baker-class is equipped with a 76 mm gun and a CIWS system to counter incoming missiles and aircraft.</p>
<p>In addition to its combat capabilities, the Baker-class performs roles such as surveillance and reconnaissance, operating alongside aircraft carriers (like the <em><a href="/volcanic-class">Volcanic</a></em>-class) and other surface ships to protect naval formations.</p>

<p>The <strong>Capricorn-class Attack Submarine</strong> is a class of submarine of the <a class="slink"  style="color: var(--color-marine); background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-marine) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/society/state/government/ministries/defence/armed-forces/marine/"><span class="fi fi-min-marine fis"></span> Marine Services</a> of <a class="slink"  style="color: var(--color-vekllei); background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-vekllei) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/world/vekllei/"><span class="fi fi-com"></span> Vekllei</a>. The class is a nuclear-powered vessel designed for a variety of underwater combat missions, including anti-ship, anti-submarine, and reconnaissance roles. With a submerged displacement of 7,500 tons and a length of 95 meters, the submarine is a key asset in Vekllei naval formations, capable of operating independently for extended periods without surfacing.</p>
<p>Powered by a variant of the <a href="/nmpr/"><em>NMPR</em></a> marine nuclear propulsion system, the Capricorn-class can achieve submerged speeds of up to 35 knots with its magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) jets. Its quiet propulsion system is designed for stealth, allowing it to remain undetected while conducting patrols or approaching enemy fleets. The submarine has a typical crew of 100, including officers and specialists trained for long-duration underwater missions.</p>
<p>The submarine’s armament includes six 533 mm torpedo tubes capable of launching the No. 8 <em>Orca</em> heavy torpedoes, designed for both anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare. In addition to torpedoes, the Capricorn-class can launch No. 2 <em>Lancet</em> cruise missiles from these tubes, providing a secondary strike capability against land-based or large surface targets.</p>
<p>The vessel is also equipped with a sophisticated sonar suite, including passive and active sonar systems for detecting enemy submarines and ships at long ranges. Electronic warfare systems and decoys, among other countermeasures, form part of its defensive complement.</p>
<p>Unlike missile submarines, the <em>Capricorn</em>-class primarily serves larger naval formations in hunter-killer and carrier-defence roles. To these ends, they may stray hundreds of kilometres away from their fleets in search of threats.</p>

The class is a modern take on the traditional battleship, repurposed for fire support roles in amphibious operations and naval engagements. With a displacement of 45,000 tons and a length of 260 meters, it is one of the largest non-carrier surface combatants in the world, designed to deliver sustained heavy firepower in support of ground forces, as well as against naval and coastal targets.</p>
<p>The battleship is powered by two <a href="/nmpr/">NMPR</a> reactors, enabling a top speed of 26 knots. The ship is designed for long-range operations with minimal logistical support, and employs autonomous systems with onboard replenishment capabilities. A crew of 1,100 operates the Federal-class, with most personnel working in fire control and aircraft operations.</p>
<p>The <em>Federal</em>-class is heavily armed with six 406 mm (16-inch) naval guns, housed in two triple turrets. These guns are capable of providing long-range bombardment of shore targets and enemy vessels. It has several other smaller guns for close-in and flak defence. The ship also features two large twin-arm launch-rail systems capable of fielding No. 2 <em>Lancet</em> cruise missiles, among a variety of other large anti-ship missiles and rocket-launched torpedos. For defence, the class is equipped with a mix of short-range anti-air missiles and CIWS to counter incoming missile threats. The <em>Federal</em>-class also includes a range of medium and long-range torpedoes, fired from launchers in its midship.</p>
<p>The <em>Federal</em>-class retains a complement of helijets &ndash; a hybrid aircraft capable of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) operations, combining the roles of helicopters and jet fighters. The ship’s flight deck, located aft, can accommodate up to six helijets that are typically used for reconnaissance, air support, and anti-submarine warfare.</p>
<p>The <em>Federal</em>-class primarily serves in a fire support role, delivering heavy bombardment during amphibious operations or coastal sieges. It is also capable of engaging in surface combat, providing area defence for larger task groups. While its role in modern naval warfare is more specialised compared to earlier eras, the <em>Federal</em>-class is a formidable platform for sustained, high-volume firepower in maritime and littoral zones. Its size and armament also imposes a significant psychological effect, a reputation readily exploited by the <a class="slink"  style="color: var(--color-marine); background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-marine) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/society/state/government/ministries/defence/armed-forces/marine/"><span class="fi fi-min-marine fis"></span> Marine Services</a> during shore bombardment trials. The only vessel of its class, <em>CVN Commonwealth</em>, serves with the Commonwealth Fleet.</p>

With a displacement of 4,000 tons and a length of 115 meters, the class was designed for operations in littoral and coastal waters, but is also capable of operating in deeper waters when necessary.</p>
<p>The ship is powered by a <a href="/nmpr/"><em>Vampire</em></a> marine nuclear power plant, allowing a maximum speed of 22 knots. The relatively small crew of 140 is complemented by a range of automated systems.</p>
<p>The Hera-class is equipped with a modular mine-laying system capable of deploying up to 150 naval mines of various types. This includes both defensive minefields to protect strategic locations and offensive minefields intended to deny access to enemy shipping routes. For mine-clearing operations, the ship is fitted with advanced sonar systems and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) designed to detect, neutralise, or recover naval mines.</p>
<p>In terms of armament, the ship carries a basic self-defence package, including a 30 mm auto-cannon and short-range No. 4 <em>Lucaya</em> anti-aircraft missiles to defend against aerial or surface threats. In Vekllei, the minelayers serve a support role alongside warships, and may be allocated to other fleets as required. Its dual-role design allows it to transition quickly between mine-laying and minesweeping missions.</p>

<p>Powered by the same <a href="/nmpr/"><em>NMPR</em></a> hydromagnetic propulsion system as the smaller <a href="/capricorn-class/"><em>Capricorn</em></a>-class attack submarine, the <em>Mantle</em>-class can operate at submerged speeds of up to 30 knots. Its reactor allows it to remain submerged for extended periods, offering considerable operational flexibility and stealth in global patrol areas. A crew of 140 operates the submarine, including specialists in missile systems, nuclear operations, and submarine warfare.</p>
<p>The submarine’s primary armament consists of 10 vertical launch tubes capable of firing No. 2 <em>Oceanic</em> ballistic missiles, each of which can be fitted with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs). These missiles give the <em>Mantle</em>-class significant strike range and capability.</p>
<p>In addition to its missile armament, the <em>Mantle</em>-class is equipped with No. 8 <em>Orca</em> heavy torpedoes in four tubes, enabling it to engage hostile submarines or surface ships if necessary. The vessel also carries advanced sonar and countermeasure systems to evade detection and attacks.</p>
<p>The Mantle-class SSBN is designed for long-duration patrols, operating undetected in the Atlantic (and elsewhere) while remaining a potent nuclear deterrent. Its role is primarily strategic, ensuring that retaliatory nuclear strikes remain possible in the event of an initial attack.</p>

<p>Powered by a nuclear steam propulsion system, the <em>Nike</em>-class can sustain prolonged deployments with minimal logistical support, though they almost always serve as a fleet component. Its maximum speed of 30 knots allows for rapid repositioning in response to emerging threats. The ship&rsquo;s displacement of 9,500 tons provides ample space for advanced weaponry and onboard facilities, and houses around 250 crew.</p>
<p>Armament includes the No. 3 <em>Rackham</em> missile system, capable of engaging both air and surface targets at ranges exceeding 100 kilometres from four twin-arm launchers at its fore and aft. In regular sailing it carries an armament of about 60 Type 22s. The cruiser is also outfitted with launch tubes for No. 5 <em>Spearhead</em> anti-ship missiles. A 76 mm dual-purpose gun serves as the primary close-in weapon system, complemented by two No. 3 <em>Seascope</em> torpedo launchers for anti-submarine operations.</p>
<p>The <em>Nike</em>-class was designed to support carriers within task groups, conducting patrols, deterrent operations, and strategic reconnaissance missions. Its capabilities make it an integral component of Vekllei naval strategy, aiming to maintain maritime security and project power across the Atlantic.</p>

The class is a compact and highly manoeuvrable vessel designed for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) operations in both coastal and open waters. With a displacement of 1,500 tons and a length of 80 meters, it is smaller than traditional destroyers and designed specifically for detecting and engaging submarines.</p>
<p>Powered by the small variant of the <a href="/nmpr/"><em>NMPR</em></a> marine nuclear propulsion system, the Palm-class can reach speeds of up to 35 knots, allowing it to move quickly in response to submarine threats. Its crew of 85 operates the various ASW systems onboard, which are the primary focus of the class’s design.</p>
<p>The ship is equipped with the No. 12 <em>Triton</em> towed sonar array system, which provides long-range detection of submarines. For close-range engagements, it uses a bank of No. 3 <em>Seascope</em> anti-submarine torpedoes, launched from four fixed tubes. The <em>Palm</em>-class also features depth charge racks at the stern, allowing for more traditional anti-submarine attacks in shallow waters.</p>
<p>The ship’s self-defence armament is relatively minimal, with a single 30 mm auto-cannon and short-range No. 4 <em>Lucaya</em> anti-aircraft missiles to fend off aerial threats. It is also equipped with countermeasure systems, including decoys and noisemakers, to evade torpedo attacks.</p>
<p>The <em>Palm</em>-class operates primarily as part of larger ASW task groups in the Commonwealth Fleet, escorting convoys or patrolling known submarine hunting grounds. Its size and agility make it well-suited to engaging enemy submarines in confined areas or near strategic waterways.</p>

It is a hybrid warship that combines the fire-support and missile defence role of a traditional cruiser with the ability to carry a small complement of VTOL aircraft. Designed primarily for independent operations or as part of smaller task forces, the class is capable of supporting limited air operations while also providing surface warfare capabilities. Its home station is <a class="slink"  style="color: var(--color-marine); background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-marine) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/world/places/ns-java/"><span class="fi fi-min-marine fis"></span> Naval Station Java</a> in <a class="slink" style="color: rgb(217, 20, 19); background: color-mix(in srgb, rgb(217, 20, 19) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/world/vekllei/verde/java/"><span class="fi fi-java"></span> Java</a>.</p>
<p>Displacing 30,000 tons and measuring 240 meters in length, the Prosperity-class is powered by the <a href="/nmpr/"><em>Vampire</em></a> marine nuclear power plant, allowing it to operate at a sustained speed of 27 knots. The vessel carries a typical air wing of 12 to 16 aircraft, including VTOL multirole fighters and anti-submarine helijets. These aircraft are launched from a large flat deck at the aft of the ship, enabling up to 4 aircraft on deck at a time.</p>
<p>The primary armament includes the  No. 3 <em>Rackham</em> anti-aircraft missile system, designed for medium-range defence against air targets. The ship also has twin-launchers for No. 5 <em>Spearhead</em> anti-ship missiles, offering surface-to-surface engagement capabilities. Close-in defence is handled by multiple CIWS installations, protecting the ship against incoming missiles and aircraft. Additionally, the Prosperity-class is outfitted with dual 76 mm naval guns for surface action and shore bombardment as an naval invasion support vessel. Anti-submarine capabilities are provided by its air complement.</p>
<p>The Prosperity-class is versatile, and serves a variety of roles with the Vekllei navy. The class of ship is suited for operations where a full-sized carrier (like the <a href="/volcanic-class/"><em>Volcanic</em></a>-class) is not necessary but air support is still required, making it a valuable asset in contested regions and asymmetric operations common in Vekllei&rsquo;s strategic interest. Its combination of defence systems and air complement allow it to act as a deterrent and as a flexible mothership for a variety of naval missions.</p>

<p>The ship’s armament includes a “Vanguard” dual-purpose 76 mm naval gun for surface and air engagements. In addition, it is equipped with “Harpooner” anti-ship missiles for striking surface targets at medium range and a short-range anti-air missile system for self-defense against aerial threats. For anti-submarine operations, the Suffrage-class carries two lightweight torpedo launchers, making it capable of limited ASW missions.</p>
<p>The Suffrage-class is equipped with advanced radar and sonar systems, providing situational awareness in both open-ocean and coastal environments. Its relatively small size and versatility allow it to perform a range of missions, including escorting larger vessels, conducting patrols, and participating in maritime security operations.</p>
<p>While not as heavily armed or armored as larger warships, the Suffrage-class ocean corvette is a flexible asset suited for environments where larger ships may be less practical. Its role in fleet operations typically centers around providing defense, conducting reconnaissance, and engaging smaller surface threats.</p>

<p>The destroyer is powered by the same <a href="/nmpr/"><em>Vampire</em></a> marine nuclear power plant as its predecessor, but improvements to its hydrodynamics allows slightly faster sustained speeds of up to 33 knots. The crew size is slightly reduced to 310, due to increased automation in various ship systems.</p>
<p>The primary armament includes the same No. 3 <em>Rackham</em> air defence system, but larger radar arrays allows for longer-range and more precise targeting of aerial threats. The system is complemented by the No. 6 <em>Shemozzle</em> anti-ship missile launchers. A dual-purpose 76 mm gun, improved from earlier designs, and an upgraded CIWS provide point defence.</p>
<p>The <em>Swordfish</em>-class is also equipped with enhanced sensor and electronic warfare systems under two Automatic Asset Command computers, allowing it to detect and track potential threats at greater distances. These updates were made to counter American improvements to chaff detection in their anti-ship missiles. Like the <em>Baker</em>-class, the <em>Swordfish</em>-class is a core part of Vekllei fleet protection and patrol operations, and serves mostly with the Commonwealth Fleet.</p>

<p>The <strong>Volcanic-class fleet carrier</strong> is a class of aircraft carrier of the <a class="slink"  style="color: var(--color-marine); background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-marine) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/society/state/government/ministries/defence/armed-forces/marine/"><span class="fi fi-min-marine fis"></span> Marine Services</a> of <a class="slink"  style="color: var(--color-vekllei); background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-vekllei) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/world/vekllei/"><span class="fi fi-com"></span> Vekllei</a>.

With a displacement of 60,000 tons, the vessel accommodates a large air wing (or &ldquo;section&rdquo;) typically comprising 40 to 50 aircraft, including VTOL advanced strike fighters.</p>
<p>Constructed with a flat-deck design and equipped with an electromagnetic catapult system, the <em>Volcanic</em>-class allows for rapid launching of aircraft. The carrier’s nuclear propulsion system enables extended deployments without the need for frequent refuelling, allowing the class to patrol Vekllei&rsquo;s territories almost continuously.</p>
<p>Armament features include the No. 3 <em>Rackham</em> air-to-air missile system, as well as a close-in weapon system (CIWS) for point defence, as part of a multilayered threat defence against aerial and missile attacks. The vessel also carries the No. 5 <em>Spearhead</em> anti-ship missile.</p>
<p>The <em>Volcanic</em>-class serves multiple roles, including fleet air defence, strike operations, and amphibious support. Its versatility allows for the coordination of joint operations with other naval and air assets, and forms the cornerstone of Vekllei&rsquo;s regional fleets. The capability of the <em>Volcanic</em> class to project power while maintaining logistical support for air operations underscores its importance in contemporary Vekllei naval doctrine.</p>
