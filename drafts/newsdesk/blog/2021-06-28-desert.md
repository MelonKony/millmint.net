**These are the rangelands**. This is what they look like. To most of us it's known as the Outback. These photos were taken two years ago, during July 2017. Australia is very, very big. It also does not have many people living in it. We have less than a tenth of the population of the United States, but are roughly equivalent in our land area. In my [previous photoset](/post/west/), we looked at Australia's temperate rainforest and glacial highlands as they appear in Tasmania. As a testament to the diversity of this country, today we look at the harsh red desert of Australia's interior.

The West Coast is foreign to most Tasmanians, who are located in Tassie's south in Hobart or north in Launceston. The West is sparsely populated and dominated almost entirely by the southwestern protected areas, which include world heritage rainforests and national parks.

It is 'old' by several criteria. The landscape itself is millions of years old, and dramatically glacial. Indigenous people have inhabited the area for tens of thousands of years. There are Huon pines in Mt Read that are currently over ten thousand years old -- these are among the oldest living organisms on Earth. Throughout its history, Tasmania's West Coast has been home to the Peternidic and Ninene people, convicts and their guards, loggers, piners, fishermen and miners.
