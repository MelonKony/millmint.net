hat good is more writing about theories and the methodology of country-constructs? More importantly — how is it authentically convincing to the person who has lived their entire lives immersed in their own ways of living? Vekllei does not use money — the purpose of this essay is to demonstrate how such a thing works, immersing Vekllei’s participatory economy in a human lens, and articulate the motivations, biases and assumptions of the average working Vekllei person.

It is important to recognise Vekllei people do not think like you.[^1] They are not more altruistic, hard-working, or kind to each other. But they hold true basic premises about the world that are unrecognisable to most readers, which can be illustrated in three categories. Note that not all Vekllei people might believe or assume all of these things, and are collected here as an illustration of the "average" Vekllei person.[^2]

1. Metaphysical assumptions

> The Vekllei person understands that there is an afterlife, and that spirits, demons, and a varying collection of mythological creatures play a part in human life. She does not hold contemporary conceptualisations of landscape -- she does not think of nature except in abstract, transcendental ways. She fears and respects nature, which is afforded sovereignty by Crown Lands under the Landscape Sovereign. She does not believe humans are caretakers of nature. She does not believe in a god, but if she does it created and maintains both the human and natural worlds.

2. Existential assumptions

> The Vekllei person is prepped from a young age to explore their adult personhood. Schooling fosters his interests and technical skills, and prepares him for the casual pace of Vekllei working life. He is motivated to accomplish a legacy of value before he dies. 

3. Material assumptions

> The Vekllei person understands objects in physical and social dimensions of utility. Life is full of small art and beauty for her, accessed frequently and easy through cafes, cinemas, picnics, galleries and travel. The spatiality and physicality of her place of surrounds are of keen interest to her and open interest in the mechanisms of society. 

## Why do people work?

Because they have to, and because there is only so much else to do. In a broad sense, activity is desire of all people, and work in Vekllei is positioned as activity, rather than labour. It is able to do this because people take a variety of work in a single job. Most days, specialised roles are performed, but periodically "company maintenance" might be substituted -- this may include maintenance or repair of company proprety, gardening, food preparation, cleaning, or social organising. [In a previous article](/posts/2020-07-13-economy/), the three precepts of Vekllei society were articulated as followed.

1. **Austerity**. Petty austerity lurks at the fringes of Vekllei life. Commmon, inconsequential consumables are always in short supply, and demand time investment to acquire. This tells the Vekllei person that their labour is consequential.
2. **Apathy**. The Vekllei economy is dominated by free agents in the open market and consolidated industry bureaus. The private senrouiva market under petty bureau organisation cannot threaten the organised de facto monopolies of the bureau companies, ensuring that
3. **Play**. The

## What does work look like?

Most people in Vekllei work three or four days a week, depending on their job and place of employ. A business is treated like 



## A guide to questioning the Vekllei system



Vekllei has a market, contained within it the products of the country allocated for foreign purchase. But the market is hidden from domestic

[^1]: Vekllei is a nation of immigrants of many cultures and beliefs, but it is also true that their children are raised in a Vekllei society with overt Vekllei cultural foundations. This trend is documented thoroughly by the Religious Affairs Office of the Commonwealth Culture Secretariat (COLSEC), which wrote "animistic features of the indigenous commonwealth emerge consistently in new generations, even where traditionally displaced by prior religious structures, correlating with the emergence of multicultural Upen faiths."
