# 💻 A Bite of the Apple: Petticoat Socialism and the Biggest Tech Company in the World
#### Hobart Phillips
<hr>

I use Apple products as the primary interfaces for consumer tech in most parts of my life. I use an iPhone paired to an Apple Watch and AirPods on the go, a MacBook Air at home, and an AppleTV in the living room. A bit more wilful consumerism, and I could complete my collection — a HomePod, or $6000 ProDisplay XDR perhaps. I like my RAM soldered to the board, ladies and gentlemen.

I am also a vocal critic, through my art and politics, of commodity culture and modern consumer society. Congratulations if you've picked up on what you might recognise as a contradiction. I talk big about human life emptied out and objectified through industrial society, while shilling for the worst kind of tech — consumer tech — and the worst kind of consumer tech — locked down, closed in, proprietary walled garden expensive tech. I don't think this is hypocritical, necessarily. People are complex, and I wouldn't disparage someone for etching out pleasure through consumption if that's what it takes to keep going in our shell-world. But I'd like to address my consumerism here.

I'm pretty much stuck in the Apple ecosystem, whether I like it or not (I do, in fact, *like it*). This wasn't always the case. I bought my first iPhone as a teenager, an **iPhone 6 Plus**, but traded it in for the objectively shitty and wonderful **Nexus 5X** in my senior year. I used that until it desoldered itself through its insane thermal issues. I went back to my 6 Plus, then bought the **Google Pixel 2 XL** when it came out. I bought a Google DayDream (a VR headset) with it, and came dangerously close to buying an Android watch (a prescient moment). This isn't evidence of impartiality, or a defense against accusations of fanboyism. It's evidence of my preference for vertical integration, control, permanence and the product-form.

Tech is an intimate part of life, so why shouldn't we see ourselves in tech? My feelings towards products are generally dependent on my personal intuition, not their specs or costs. The things I have in my life aren't tools, they're appliances; objects, and should delight you in their good design and usefulness. I suppose there's a spiritual component to it, and I won't apologise for that. It bubbles up from an instinct for control, unity and simplicity. This does not apply exclusively to Apple products, this is more fundamental than that — it folds into a larger conception of appliances and design. I might get caught up in a hype cycle, or drink the kool-aid on a few occasions, but this isn't intellectual, it's instinctive, and it informs much more than petty consumerism.

There are good reasons why Vekllei is so cleanly vertically integrated, so culturally homogenous, and so absolute in its absence of money. These aspects of my work arise from the same instinct that determines one perfect language; one perfect religion; one perfect uniform; one perfect architecture. It is not that a moneyless utopia is an interesting thought-experiment; it's that a utopia could only be moneyless. This is a binary instinct — it *is*, or it *isn't*. It evolves constantly with taste.

Walter Isaacson, in the biography of Steve Jobs, wrote of his legacy:

>[Jobs's] intensity encouraged a binary view of the world. Colleagues referred to the hero/shithead dichotomy. You were either one or the other, sometimes on the same day. The same was true of products, ideas, even food: Something was either “the best thing ever,” or it was shitty, braindead, inedible. As a result, any perceived flaw could set off a rant. The finish on a piece of metal, the curve of the head of a screw, the shade of blue on a box, the intuitiveness of a navigation screen—he would declare them to “completely suck” until that moment when he suddenly pronounced them “absolutely perfect.” He thought of himself as an artist, which he was, and he indulged in the temperament of one.[^1] <sup>p.309</sup>

I've seen people diagnose Jobs as autistic, an insult to both autistic people and Jobs. Jobs was well aware of his apparent cruelty, and finely socially attuned. Steve Jobs, by any account, was a deeply flawed human individual with a very sincere belief in good taste and design. Another passage recalls his incompatibility with a girlfriend:

>They also had a basic philosophical difference about whether aesthetic tastes were fundamentally individual, as Redse believed, or universal and could be taught, as Jobs believed. She accused him of being too influenced by the Bauhaus movement. “Steve believed it was our job to teach people aesthetics, to teach people what they should like,” she recalled. “I don’t share that perspective. I believe when we listen deeply, both within ourselves and to each other, we are able to allow what’s innate and true to emerge.”[^1] <sup>p.158</sup>

There are plenty of rude visionaries in Silicon Valley, and so-called "tech culture" is empty and superficial. But few people possess the sort of magical intuition Jobs had, or his deep appreciation for taste and design. Plenty of companies innovate, but Apple strikes me as a principles company. It makes decisions that make no market sense, like cutting the headphone jack, which generated far more negative press than short-term sales in bluetooth headphones.

> I think most creative people want to express appreciation for being able to take
advantage of the work that’s been done by others before us. I didn’t invent the language or mathematics
I use. I make little of my own food, none of my own clothes. Everything I do depends on other members
of our species and the shoulders that we stand on. And a lot of us want to contribute something back to
our species and to add something to the flow. It’s about trying to express something in the only way that
most of us know how—because we can’t write Bob Dylan songs or Tom Stoppard plays. We try to use
the talents we do have to express our deep feelings, to show our appreciation of all the contributions that
came before us, and to add something to that flow. That’s what has driven me.

I believe deeply that design matters, and that the stuff around us should reflect that.
