## Overview
{{< hint pink >}}
߷ This article is about [**Vekllei**](/utopia/vekllei) society
{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint panel >}}
**This article** discusses one of the most important and visible organisations in everyday Vekllei life: Vekllei National Rail. Vekllei is criss-crossed by hundreds of different rail lines of various gauges, grades, and purposes. In fact, it runs many lines at a total loss, often under capacity. To understand these inefficiencies is to understand why the National Rail exists, and to some extent, how Vekllei's state assets and powerful bureaus shape life in the country today.

**he National Rail of Vekllei (VNR)** is a catch-all term for bureau-backed, state-owned rail operators of Vekllei. In casual use, it refers to the Vekllei National Railway A.r.R. and its sister companies, like Vekllei Metro, which are structured within the service-oriented Railways Bureau. More precisely, Vekllei National Rail encompasses several different bureaus that operate, design, maintain and communicate rail service in the country, which itself is further included under the Transport Requisite of the Vekllei Government.

Like most critical organisations of Vekllei, the structure and directorship of Vekllei National Rail is complex, but can be simplified by understanding that all rail transport in the country is ultimately the responsibility of an organisation called Vekllei National Rail, and it is towards this organ that this article is addressed. Today, the National Rail operates nearly 20,000km of track, indicating the density of the rail service it provides, and services nearly 20 million people each day through its network.

### Structure

What we know as the Vekllei Government is actually portioned between several powerful state bodies, each representing the natural political concerns of the modern Vekllei state. These are, in no particular order:

* The internal governance of Vekllei
* The maintenance, development and security of the Vekllei Commonwealth, including its territories
* The rule of the Land Sovereign and its presence in the state

Accordingly, the Vekllei Government is separated into two governing bodies.

1. **The Palace of the Land Sovereign**
2. **The Government of the Vekllei Commonwealth, including Vekllei and its Atlantic possessions**

The following passages outline their structure and purpose as a general framework and reference for the political structure of the country.

## Government of Vekllei

{{< hint panel >}}
**Since most Vekllei people** catch a train each day, VNR is a uniquely intimate and treasured organ of the Vekllei state. It is somehow exempted from the public apathy and resentment of bureaucracy that targets other monopolies of the Vekllei state, and is routinely regarded as among the most beloved and appreciated "companies" in Vekllei.

### Administration of the Interior

#### Ministry of Foreign Affairs

## Palace of the Sovereign



## Notes

[^1]: Vekllei's 'war' prefix is used as a designation for pre-war railcars and locomotives, transliterated from the native word for the Junta's society.
