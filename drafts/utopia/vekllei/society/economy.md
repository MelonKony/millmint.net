## 1. Overview

{{< hint panel >}}
**The economy of Vekllei** is a sparkling jewel of its crown of contradictions, and totally unique in the world today.
{{< /hint >}}

<span class="fc">V</span>
**ekllei language**, abbreviated to just **Vekllei**, has six core sublanguages that are used commonly today. Although they often intersect, these different systems of communication are distinct languages in their own right, used for different purposes in different arenas of communication.

{{< details title="Systems of Language" open=true >}}
1. **Spoken Vekllei**, which is everyday spoken language. It draws from two glossaries with different meanings and feelings, called *Oa* and *Loh*.
2. **Topet**, which are logographic characters (occasionally characterised as hieroglyphs). Like other pictographic languages, *Topet* characters can be broken down into repeating components, called *Topotte*.
3. **Rapotenne**, is the traditional logographic language of names. It is much older than Topet, and has more in common with spiritual runes than modern logography.
4. **Potenne**, lit. ‚Äú*Hand-Talk*‚Äù, is a sign language that incorporates gestures and signing to add meaning to emotion to spoken language, and occasionally in place of it.
5. **Upotenne**, lit. ‚Äú*Spirit-Hand-Talk*‚Äù, as the recreation of runes in human form, used limitedly in spiritual ritual.
6. **Vekllei Semaphore** is the codification of colour and shape. Traditionally limited to colour, shape and pattern are now also included in *Vekllei Semaphore*, in which full sentences can be formed.

### Introduction

### History

As an island country, Vekllei is a traditional maritime state dependent on fish stocks and natural resources in its surrounding oceans, primarily the

Vekllei's fledgling kingdom under rule of Simiyo Kehsmiouz successfully positioned the country as an Atlantic trading port and mercantile hub, bringing new wealth to the country and beginning the Era of Rest.

>* **6000** BC - **3500** BC, **Kalaallisut / Kala**, Proto-*Quutetast* extinct Algic language.
>* **3500** BC - **800** AD,  **Quutetast**,  Algic-Aleutian extinct language.
>* **1200** BC - **900** AD, **Islandi**,  Indo-European Scandinavian language.
>* **900** AD - **1600** AD, **Topyas** (Old Vekllei),  fusion dialect of *Islandi* and *Quutetast*.
>* **1600** AD - **present**, **Modern Vekllei**, evolution of *Topyas*. Spoken today.

## 2. Structure

### The Bureau System

A ***Bureau*** is the transliteration of the Vekllei word *Boreaul*, meaning a writing desk. In Vekllei it has evolved to infer a singular labour monopoly of the country (in state speak called "masthead chapels;" trade unions), either as government State Requisites **[^1]** or private venrouive monopolies **[^2]**.

Bureaus can consist of a single company, as is often the case in government departments, or several hundred. In this sense, a private Bureau resembles a central federation trade union, organising companies into industry monopolies that, while legally independent from government affairs, are traditionally expected to cooperate with the democratic processes of the country. Bureaus, as administrators of work in Vekllei, are fundamentally political organs, and the Bureau Secretariat, the legal congress of all bureaus, reports directly to the Prime Ministers of Vekllei.

When we talk about a ***Bureau***, it refers to a *Bureau Proper* unless otherwise stated. Bureaux Proper are the formal trade organisations of the country, bound to its direction and intention. They coexist with *Bureau Minor* or "Petty Bureaux," which are informal, often provincial or regional, independent from Proper Bureaux, and better resemble free trade unions. The following infosheets describe their differences.

## 4. Currency and Markets

![img](/images/crown.jpg)

<span class="fc">T</span>
**he Vekllei Kroner**, or ‚Äú**Crown**,‚Äù is hundreds of years old, and Vekllei still operates a mint for currency. At any time, a Vekllei person can write to the National Mint and order a set of coins, like the ones pictured above. So what is going on here?

Although the Kroner has not been used since 2022, after the last village in Stochi returned coinage to the Mint, it continues to exist to this day as a gold-backed currency in the International Market, through which Vekllei trades with other countries. The physical coins, produced mostly as a novelty in the tradition of *mayaesdiou* (medallions, or small metal pieces commonly collected and given in Vekllei), are a physical coinage of the International Market. The coins also operate as a form of bullion, or wealth reserve, since each coin is worth exactly its face value in gold. Since the International Market is completely closed and independent of the domestic economy, its value is controlled directly by the so-called Government Bank. It is one of the few gold-backed currencies in a developed nation today.

To further complicate things, there are actually two different Kroner in Vekllei. There is the **Vekllei Kroner**, which represents the International Market, but there is also a seperate **Government/State Kroner**, which is not minted and used only as an investment mechanism, backed by government "white bonds" which are usually measures of labour-hours or refined materials. It is, in a sense, a fiat currency alongside a gold-backed currency.

They exist independently because they are used for two seperate purposes. The Vekllei Kroner is used a wealth reserve and bullion, and also represents the collective wealth of the Vekllei people. Each citizen, in theory, is entitled to an equal share of the Government Bank, although it can only be withdrawn as currency in specific circumstances. Vekllei also holds substantial amounts of foreign currency in the Government Bank and Vekllei Kroner, which is used to invest and stabilise holdings and capital in foreign countries. The Government Kroner, on the other hand, is used as an investment mechanism abroad, usually in support of infrastructure. It is also used to acquire foreign currencies through investment in foreign capital.

Despite having two currencies, neither the "Vekllei Crown" or the "Government Crown" are used in the domestic economy in Vekllei, which is autonomous and not subject to a central bank. So it is that Vekllei‚Äôs currency is both little more than a novelty and essential to the function of the country in a world still ruled by money.

>**In the coinage depicted above ‚Äî 8 coins are minted in Vekllei today.** They were designed in 2015, in the year of independence. They represent eight core values in the country.  
>  
>The ‚Äúsmall crowns,‚Äù worth 1VK and 10VK respectively, represent fraternity and liberty, two founding elements of the Vekllei constitution. The 50VK coin is plated in silver and has a small ruby inset. Rubies are used to represent energy, in this case, the vitality of the spirits, which dominate Upen and the Vekllei landscape. The 100, 200, 500 and 1,000VK coins represent different landscapes of the country. As a volcanic island nation, the ocean (100) and landscape (200) coins are fairly straightforward. The humanity coin (500) represents the Vekllei people and ancestry ‚Äî note how humans are placed alongside other natural forces. The flower coin (1,000VK) represents the flowers of the country, which are important spiritually and have formed part of the Vekllei identity. Vekllei has the most flowers per capita in the world. The final, larger 10,000VK coin represents the previous seven together, as a total sum of Vekllei landscape and identity.

## Notes

[^1]: State Requisites, or *requoisesiasn amourisocietie* (A.r.), for example the *Thunderburo*

[^2]: State Industries, or *societie indastrie* (S.A.), like the historic *General Reactor*

[^3]: *Demiosnjarnkah*, or "old arts," refers to the religious tradition of poetry and art-making, which to this day depends on the older extant glossaries of Vekllei's early runic system.

[^4]: *Postliteracy* is a hypothetical concept popularised in the early 21st Century during massive upheavals in education and mass media by telescreens and the videophone. It suggests that, as reading and writing are replaced by convenient forms of visual communication, traditional literacy becomes unnecessary. Sometimes called *aliteracy*.
