## 1. Overview

{{< hint panel >}}
**The National Mint of Vekllei** is shrouded in mystery, since its use as a producer of coins in a country without money seems obscure. As is the case in many of Vekllei's State Requisites (A.r.), its purpose and structure is both uniquely Vekllei and thoroughly obtuse, two facts addressed here in this article.
{{< /hint >}}

<span class="fc">T</span>
**he National Mint of Vekllei**, referred to as the **Mint** or **Mint A.r.**[^1] within the country, is sole producer of coins and government bonds in [Vekllei](/utopia/vekllei), as well as the sole proprietor of its domestic gold bullion reserve. It is a civilian state requisite responsible for physical money supply of Vekllei, which it continues to mint in the moneyless Floral Period as souvenirs (and, internationally, legal tender). It also serves as the primary printing facility for Vekllei's Government Bank, the country's Central Bank and regulator of money supply in both Vekllei and Government Crowns.

The Mint is among Vekllei's oldest institutions, founded as a successor to the Port of Vekllei Mint in 1386. It is headquartered in the Nation Mint Complex in the Gold District of Vekllei Proper.

### Introduction


### History


### Structure

The Mint is an executive government agency directly operated by the Vekllei Government, signalling its responsibility to Vekllei society rather than the Land Sovereign.

## 2. Coinage

{{< hint panel >}}
**The Royal Mail** maintains a constitutionally-bound monopoly on all postage in the country, leaving it the sole provider of universal postage service in Vekllei. Like most State Requisites (A.r.), however, it has substantial international trade and foreign dealings that provide for its common description as a state-owned for-profit enterprise, or public corporation.
{{< /hint >}}

<span class="fc">U</span>
**niversal service** is, by the glossary of the Mail, truly universal. As mandated by Vekllei law, the Mail provides delivery for all postage material anywhere in the world, or indeed, beyond it. It maintains 6,424 post offices across Vekllei, including its antarctic and peripheral possessions. The Mail's first Lunar Post Office opened in 2059. In addition to its domestic monopoly, the Mail contributes nearly VK❦2.6 trillion each year towards the Vekllei Government Securities Bureau (the country's sovereign wealth fund) through its international postage and courier services abroad, under the name World Post.

Since the Mail's Office of Telecommunications is also responsible for all telephones, telegrams and videophones in the country, the Mail's status as a lynchpin of communication is absolute, and heavily protected by the postwar Vekllei constitution.

The Mail aims to provide next-day delivery during weekdays in zero-code (that is to say, *Home Island*) regions. Overnight delivery is also generally available between *Home Islands*, *Aismious* Islands, *Kala* and the *Azores* during weekdays. Most Lunar territories are available on Mondays and Fridays, and other territories are available according to the Mail's region table.

Although Vekllei people do not pay to post items, stamps are affixed with coloured squares called *chromacodes* which are used in the automatic sorting machines common in the country. International Mail uses traditional stamps with price listed, and the Vekllei Crown displayed. Franking is used for tracking and identification.

### Government Crowns

Special, commercial and industrial postage is managed within the **Postal Service Bureau** through special sorting facilities and a dedicated postal network. Regular business postage is funnelled through regular daily service, but hazardous, oversized and dangerous goods are accepted by special Post Offices designed to accept them. The Mail does not provide special services for regular residential or courier delivery.

The Mail is best known overseas as the **World Post**, which offers services for foreign clients and has established itself as one of the Big Four international transnational courier services in the world today. Similar to domestic postal systems in other countries, the World Post offers flat rates for delivery anywhere in the world, priced according to size and weight. In addition, sister company **Universal Express** offers next-day weekday delivery in certain markets. Most employees of the World Post and Universal Express are foreign workers banking labour-hours for immigration to Vekllei. Unlike domestic service, the World Post and Universal Express use private courier contracts extensively to fulfil orders.

### Finance

The **Labour Bank of Vekllei**[^2] is easily accessible via the Mail's **Financial Services Bureau**. Although inaccessible within the country, savings can be withdrawn conditionally upon emigration, and the Mail offers easy access and financial counselling for Vekllei people. Through the Financial Services Bureau, the Mail also offers financial management to immigrant populations with wealth transfer (the phrase for banking of savings and prior income) and Overseas Accounting, commonly used to send money to family abroad.

## 3. Operations

**As a military organ**, the Mail A.r. retains military ranks for its staff, commanded by a Postmaster General and aided by a civilian regulator designed to keep its critical service available to Vekllei people. The Mail's fleet includes dedicated jets, automatic trucks, mail trains, intercity pneumatic systems, vehicle automen, and postmen, all wearing the red and gold colours of the organisation. In total, the Mail delivers nearly 50 million pieces of mail during weekdays.
{{< /hint >}}

<span class="fc">I</span>
**t is evident** that the services assigned to the Mail by the postwar constitution are of critical importance to the stability of Vekllei society. In addition to being one of the oldest active postal organisations in the world, the Royal Mail of Vekllei is tremendously busy, since physical post has scarcely been displaced by the telephone in the country. Even without the Mail's international postage, domestic mail each day can exceed 12 million pieces -- enough for 1 in 2 people, though commercial mail and periodicals are included.

As is typical for critical bureaus in Vekllei, the Mail alleviates the stress of daily service through its dense, vertically-integrated infrastructure aided by automatic (automen vehicles) and permanent fixtures (pneumatic systems and automatic sorting/franking machines). It is precisely this commitment to infrastructure that makes the Mail so visible in daily life, and contributes to its ongoing legacy as Vekllei's oldest running government institution.

### Staff

{{< hint caption>}}

{{</hint>}}

The Mail employs 48,960 people full-time across its various offices, and nearly 200,000 automen in various roles. Although the Mail does retain a staff of postmen and couriers, most urban daily service is now provided by automatic vehicles and sorting, which account for nearly half of the total automen owned by the organisation. Instead, the majority of Mail employees are involved in the running of the organisation -- mostly as clerks, managers, and administrators. Around 10,000 postmen are employed by the Mail in daily delivery, called "posties". There are around 8,000 postal routes in the country.

Although at first glance the number of automen dramatically exceeds demand, the total count is misleading -- most automen with the Mail are integrated into the infrastructure of its sorting centres and post offices, and very few are traditionally autonomous robots commonly seen in public in Vekllei. Only about 8,000 automen are employed in physical mail delivery.

There are 16,220 post boxes in Vekllei, which are iconic for their red and gold paint and intricate detailing.

### Fleet

{{< /hint >}}

The Mail retains a large and diverse fleet of vehicles in regular operations, which, due to their diversity and and expense, have become iconic around the world. From bicycles to space planes, the Mail's fleet of vehicles rivals in diversity postal services three times its size, largely benefitted by Vekllei's obfuscated budgeting system and cultural importance afforded to the organisation.

 The following table lists company vehicles relevant to regular postal service.

## Notes

[^1]: *A.r.* is a shortening of *state requisite* (A.r., or requoisesiasn amourisocietie)

[^2]: The *Labour Bank of Vekllei* (often called the *Government Bank*) is Vekllei's social bank, and each Vekllei person is entitled to an equal share of it.
