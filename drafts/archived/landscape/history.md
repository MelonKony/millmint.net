### Ancient Vekllei

Human habitation is known to have started in Vekllei nearly 6,000 years ago, likely by arctic peoples from nearby Kalalist, who settled along the Southern Coast of the Home Islands. Early *sagas* incorporate much older stories and myths

After the British Oil Crisis and subsequent decolonisation of Tanganyika, Vekllei was made independent amidst the failing of the British economy. The failed state of Vekllei, which had seen its government and economy totally collapse in the Atomic War, had been a tremendous expense for the United Kingdom and was done away with in a rapid independence article passed in British Parliament in 2015. This article laid out a framework for independence and deoccupation of Vekllei within three years, with provisions for British Commonwealth membership and trade reparations. In practice, independence would not be complete until nearly 2020, at which time Vekllei's sovereignty was restored in a ceremony the people of the United Kingdom were well used to by then; the lowering of the Union Jack and in its place the raising of a new, young flag.
