Not just complex insofar as there‚Äôs a lot to read about it, but that it uses concepts and terminology you might not be familiar with if this is your first time around utopian fiction.\nSo Vekllei is a utopia ‚Äî what does this mean? It‚Äôs latin for ‚Äúno place,‚Äù and I use that literally. Vekllei, in a literal sense, cannot exist. Not because I think it could never have existed, or it breaks the laws of physics ‚Äî but because it exists in a certain place and time that is just isn‚Äôt replicable. It‚Äôs all built from the ground up. It\u0026rsquo;s a dream facing our past.\nVekllei is a very good place to live, but it is not perfect. Utopia does not mean ‚Äúperfect place‚Äù. Utopia is a form of social dreaming, much like worldbuilding, linked to the values and priorities of its author. In utopian studies, ‚Äúutopia‚Äù is usually broken down further:\n Eutopia ‚Äî ‚Äúgood place‚Äù Dystopia ‚Äî ‚Äúbad place‚Äù  Note that both form a part of the ‚Äúutopia‚Äù ‚Äî this is appropriate, since Vekllei is grounded in a social realism that acknowledges the good and bad parts of life. Indeed, they are inseparable ‚Äî you cannot have the light without the dark. Such is the internal contradiction of any good utopia.\n You can read more about Vekllei (the country) by clicking here.\nThere are three parts to my ‚Äúsocial dreaming‚Äù:\n Landscape ‚Äî the world and country of Vekllei. When you think of ‚Äúutopia,‚Äù this is it ‚Äî shining modernist cities against striking landscapes. Character ‚Äî not all social dreaming takes place in spaces. Some of it is built around experiences, objects and relationships. Tzipora is a ‚Äúcharacter utopia‚Äù in the sense that she represents a utopian life experience, full of stories good and bad. Author ‚Äî Vekllei is a representation of the problems of my life, as a form of escapism. A lot of my posts here reflect dissatisfactions and displacements in my own life ‚Äî consumer society, commodification of childhood, wage labour, postmodernism, etc. I‚Äôm very much a part of this utopian dialectic.

It‚Äôs escapism; it‚Äôs a dream.\nIt‚Äôs a bit cringe to grandstand your political beliefs, doncha think?\nVekllei is a personal utopia. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm selling. At least you‚Äôre getting good opinions.\nWhere‚Äôs the tension if it‚Äôs perfect?\nVekllei is very cynical and tragic in places. Utopia is just a reflection of the author, good and bad.\nIs there a novel? A story? A comic?\nI‚Äôm working on a comic right now. I‚Äôm pretty much working on Vekllei full-time so I‚Äôm hoping to announce it soon. I‚Äôve got a lot of different Vekllei projects going.\nWhere is Vekllei?\nIceland.\nWhy does Vekllei look Japanese?\nVekllei is like a country of Scandinavians speaking French with an Aussie accent in Sh≈çwa era Japan/Maoist China/Taiwan etc. Vekllei looks however I imagine utopia looks.\nHow does that make sense?\nWhy can‚Äôt it just be cool?\nIs your alt-history thought out?\nVekllei‚Äôs history is whatever I need it to be. I‚Äôm always trying to be realistic, but it‚Äôs all worked backwards from the setting. I‚Äôm not really ‚Äúworldbuilding‚Äù in a typical sense. Very little of it is published, most of it is retrieved on request. Just ask if you have questions.\nIs Vekllei communist?\nNo.\nBut Vekllei calls itself ‚Äúpetticoat socialist‚Äù.\nVekllei is set in a culture of Marxist revivalism in the 50s and 60s. A lot of Vekllei‚Äôs lexicon is set in that context. Vekllei is a decentralised democracy that doesn‚Äôt use money. It‚Äôs a sort of participatory economy.\nWhy the \u0026ldquo;petticoat\u0026rdquo;?\nVekllei is a female country. Womanhood is decommodified. It\u0026rsquo;s maternal, social and friendly where socialist rhetoric is masculine, technocratic and progressive.\nWho is Zelda?\nZelda is another name for Tzipora. She has two names specifically to confuse you.\nWhat is the ‚Äúbulletin‚Äù?\nI publish the Atlantic Bulletin once a month via email.

Economy #  1. Participatory Economics in Utopia #  1.1. Introduction #  The daily functioning of the Vekllei economy is as miraculous as it is unique. Key organs and mechanisms of the Vekllei economy reality are positioned against or outright opposed against each other. And a startling series of contradictions \u0026ndash; one after the other, each more unusual than the last. Vekllei is a planned economy; it is also a free market. Property ownership is obfuscated by portioned sovereignty of land and product. Decommodification has devalued products in a country based on manufacturing. There are many contradictions, inefficiencies and simply unusual mechanisms in the Vekllei domestic market, and this article hopes to elucidate at least some of them.\nThe Bureau System, sometimes called Product Socialism, is the name by which Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s economy is most often described. A primitive form was found in the anarchy in the wake of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s atomic bombing, but by 2020 it was written into the document that would become Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s postwar constitution.\n Prior to the Atomic War, Vekllei was a closed, protectionist market under rule of a monarchy puppeted by a military junta. A backwards and quaint country for much of its 20th century, there is no period in Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s history which we might describe as \u0026ldquo;industrial capitalism\u0026rdquo;. It is in this context, in the ashes of the Atomic War and under British occupation, that we can sympathise with the barter economy that would eventually modernise into the Bureau System, a thoroughly unique economic ideology in the world today.\n  What makes the Bureau System unique? Simply that, in common contexts, no money exists in Vekllei whatsoever. This is moneylessness in spirit, too \u0026ndash; there are no currency substitutes, be they labour vouchers or ration systems. This initial fact of life and symptom of destitution is now codified and vigorously defended by the Vekllei state, making the country the only example of a moneyless state of its size in the world.\nThe abolition of currency is allowed by two facts:\n1. A general post-scarcity and surplus of goods.  2. The inefficiencies of a profitless market compensated by the total abolition of waged labour/labour costs. The function fo Vekllei   1.2. Principles #  The economy informs the high standard of living, but also influences architecture, culture and even the Vekllei person himself. In the context of the Vekllei participist economy, even the notions of manhood and womanhood are reorganised around the basic principles of the economy, which are themselves symptoms of Vekllei‚Äôs history, landscape and culture.\nThe core principles of Vekllei‚Äôs parecon, usually identified by name as petticoat society, are as follows:\n Self-management and self-interest through Sundress Municipalism. Classification of property as an independent social organ, like nature. Abolishment of currency and currency-substitutes. Participatory employment. Economic feminisation.  1.3. Culture #  Most unusual is Vekllei‚Äôs cultural phantom of property and its absence in business and the home. That is not to indicate a tendency of either private or shared commodity, but rather an absence of commodity altogether ‚Äî a fiscal kingdom divorced entirely from neighbouring notions of property, usurped instead by a common understanding of cityscape and objects alike as products of nature, capable neither of possessing or communalising it, codified mostly by a cultural intuition that forms one part of the Vekllei idea of ‚Äòownership‚Äô.\nYes, these people do not recognise property in their domestic lives, nor do they carry with them any currency or currency-substitute (labour vouchers, crediting systems, etc.) ‚Äî but to describe the economic function of society as simply utopian in the fashion of 19th century fiction-writers would be misleading. Vekllei is a miracle produced in the intersection of culture and power that have determined national priority since the First Atomic War. Vekllei is not a blueprint or mathematical template, and appears to be so far irreproducible abroad. This could be because of any or all of the following:\n  Vekllei is perhaps the most highly concentrated country of its size on Earth ‚Äî 80 percent of the 20 millions that call it home are located in the wide urban region referred to as the Capital and the city-state of Vekllei. Indeed, domestically the entire inhabited coastline is considered to be part of one large, singular city community. Vekllei was devastated entirely by the First Atomic War, which extinguished the protectionist Denoisesn regime and left the urban centres bare of infrastructure, allowing architects and urban planners to implement a so-called ‚Äògarden city‚Äô design in the principle of traditional Vekllei spiritualism. Vekllei does not suffer from internal factionalism of the other great powers, and is ethnically and culturally homogenous. The modern Vekllei economy bypassed liberalisation of trade entirely through its monarchical-authoritarian-utopian progression, and has no nostalgia for either currency or real market economics. Most crucially, the last fifty years of advanced robotics has essentially relegated vast swaths of the labour of the majority of her workforce as unnecessary, or comfortable. Automation is not universal, and so all people must work in fairness, but society has reorganised around professional hierarchies where every person casts their lot in at the lowest rung ‚Äî essentially, in theory, alleviating work as anything other than hobby.  So Vekllei has an unusual system that is desperate to consume work-hours. It is labour-intensive where wanted, alleviated by industrial machinery where preferred, and completely automated where necessary.   2. Petticoat Socialism #  3.

Overview #  1.1 Introduction #  Tzipora Desmoisnes (also Zelda lo Ula Desmoisnes, born May 5 2047) is a Vekllei Gregori Baby and librarian, and is the character utopia of the Petticoat Project. Born to artist and political activist Mette Sumoisnesn and an unknown father, the family moved to Colombia when Tzipora was six months old. Her return to Vekllei as a teen-ager would mark her integration into Vekllei society and her diagnosis as Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s first victim of Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome.\nTzipora is characterised by her intense disposition and conservative tastes, informed in part by her youth growing up poor in Colombia and the United States. Although she is naturally quiet and independent, she loves dearly her adoptive father Baron Desmoisnes and family friend Ayn Rumouisen, and holds affectionate, close relationships with those important to her.\n   Tzipora struggles with undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder, which interferes with her sleep and manifests as several triggers, including large dogs and lying on her chest. Her nervous behaviour has manifested in various tics, she is most obviously nervous pulling and rubbing of her clothes and nose. She is relatively unknown at a national level in Vekllei, except as an occasional medical curiosity, but is relatively famous internationally as the oldest surviving Gregori Baby.\nAfter the American invasion of Colombia in 2057, Mette paid an education broker several thousands of pesos to arrange Tzipora‚Äôs education in California. Although Tzipora would graduate in 2061, she had lost contact with her mother and had lapsed on her education visa. Without an allowance and barred from legitimate work, she moved to Utah the same year in search of income.\nAfter finding work as a motel maid and residence at a women‚Äôs shelter, Tzipora was witness to much of the industrial unrest in Utah in the early 2060s. After being threatened and later nearly murdered by strikebreakers for her association with the United Mine Workers, at that time an illegal organisation, she met [[Baron Desmoisnes]], an agent of the Vekllei Americas Bureau at National Intelligence. In 2063, she would flee Utah under his advice and return to Vekllei under emergency asylum.\nSince arriving in [[Vekllei]] at the age of 16, Tzipora has received two doctorates from Montre University and currently works as a community librarian in the small Montre village of Montre-Lola.\n2. Early Life #  Birth in Ro #  Mette Sumoisnesn #  Mette became pregnant aged 22 during her revival as an underground sculpture artist. Unsure of whether she was ready to raise a child, she later returned home to her family home for the first time in six years on the advice of her friends. The following Autumn, Tzipora was born.\nShe was delivered at the Ro Maternity Clinic without a father, since Mette was involved with several partners at the time.\nChildhood in Colombia #  3. Education in the United States #  2057 (First Year) #  Shaky beginnings #  In 2057, Tzipora began her first year at St Mary\u0026rsquo;s Catholic College in Sacramento at age 10.\n2058 (Second Year) #  2059 (Third Year) #  2060 (Fourth Year) #  An illicit relationship #  By early summer in 2060, Tzipora came to rely emotionally on John Suzak, her mathematics teacher. The intensification of her feelings for him culminated in July, when Suzak discussed taking her to Disneyland. Although nothing would come of these plans, they would come back to haunt Tzipora.\nSchool Pariah #  By August 2060, Suzak had been quietly reassigned by the school board and disappeared from classes soon after. His predation on students had been an open secret, and rumour of his lovers soon focused on one of his students, a sixteen-year-old named Sue Jacobson. Suspicion was raised further by Jacobson\u0026rsquo;s absence from classes in the month following Suzak\u0026rsquo;s departure, leading to speculation by her peers that she had run off with him. By the time Jacobson returned to school in September, she found herself the subject of intense ridicule and gossip.\nAlthough Jacobson was never sure of who Suzak\u0026rsquo;s other girlfriends were, her friend Dolly told her that Tzipora, with whom she shared a dorm, had visited Disneyland with him in August. Hoping to distract attention from herself, Jacobson told peers that Tzipora had fallen pregnant while vacationing with him at Disneyland, which was why she\u0026rsquo;d been in the hospital. Although it was a preposterous fabrication, and Tzipora had never been to Disneyland or so much as kissed a boy, she was already regarded as a loser among her classmates and the rumour quickly stuck.\nEven though most quietly considered Jacobson to have been Suzak\u0026rsquo;s illicit lover, Tzipora was an easy target and much of the ridicule was directed towards her. Although public bullying quickly settled in the weeks following, most of her classmates would never quite see Tzipora the same way. Worst of all, the rumour had spread throughout her year and the school, and had poisoned most people\u0026rsquo;s impressions of Tzipora before they\u0026rsquo;d met her. Tzipora, for her part, struggled to defend herself \u0026ndash; she\u0026rsquo;d never been to Disneyland, and had never been pregnant, but it was true that she\u0026rsquo;d had a crush on Suzak. The grain of truth was enough to falter her confidence in defence.\nTzipora failed most of her exams in October, in part because of the stress the incident with Suzak had caused her. After her mother failed to return her letters sent in early December, Tzipora was rapidly becoming convinced that she was now alone in the world.\nA Physical Toll #  Around the time the bullying started, Tzipora fell ill from the stress. Although she would later remark that her visible tics were brought about by her time in Utah, the truth was that she first exhibited physical tics sometime during her experience in September-thru-November. Even when mildly anxious she would cover her speech with pulling and tugging on her shirt, and would wipe her nose with her fingers and hand incessantly.\n2061 (Final Year) #  A Lonely New Year #  Sue Jacobson\u0026rsquo;s Arrest #  In March, Dolly, who had told the falsehood about Tzipora and Suzak going to Disneyland, had a falling out with Sue Jacobson. Shortly after, when confronted about lying about Jacobson in class, Dolly let slip that it was Jacobson who was the liar, as Jacobson had lied about Tzipora\u0026rsquo;s pregnancy in the first place. This information made its way back to Tzipora, whose bewilderment at the mundanity of Jacobson\u0026rsquo;s reasoning quickly transformed into rage.\nAlthough powerless to act out her revenge fantasies, Tzipora kept a close eye on everything Jacobson did from then on. Then, in May, shortly after Tzipora\u0026rsquo;s 14th birthday, an opportunity presented itself.\nOne week to the day after Tzipora\u0026rsquo;s birthday, Jacobson left her schoolbag behind in the classroom while the class changed for gym class. Tzipora, who had received permission from the nurse to sit out activities, quickly seized on her absence and began rummaging through her belongings, looking for something to steal or destroy. She came across Jacobson\u0026rsquo;s diary, which, among other things, mentioned Jacobson\u0026rsquo;s involvement with a book club run by her cousin. Taking note of the names in her contacts and looking to cause trouble, Tzipora placed an anonymous tip with the police that a girl in her class was organising communist support among the students.\nUnknown to Tzipora was that the book club in question occasionally circulated banned literature, and an investigation the day after the call revealed anarchist works hidden in Sue\u0026rsquo;s dorm. Sue Jacobson, her cousin, three other girls from St Mary\u0026rsquo;s and six other people in total were arrested in the weeks following. Most, Sue among them, were sentenced to 8 years in prison after an investigation by the House Committee for Unamerican Activities. Six months later, in November, John Suzak would also be arrested in connection to the circulation of terrorist works.\nTzipora, terrified by her actions and that she might be implicated, found herself concerned for her safety. Unable to contact her mother and with her school debt due in June, Tzipora began to make plans to pool the last of her money and travel back to Colombia, hopefully finding her mother there.\n4.

Overview #  1.1 Introduction #   Vekllei (also The Kingdom of Vekllei, The Vekllei Commonwealth, Islanda, Iceland) is a sovereign island country situated in the northern Atlantic, between Greenland and the Faroe Islands. It consists of the Vekllei city-state (referred to as the Home Island or Crown Metropole), two autonomous territories, six crown territories and various possessions including over a hundred satellite islands and islets. It is the 14th most densely-populated country in the world, with a population of 24.4 millions mostly situated around the Capital Region in the south-west of the Home Island. Its capital and largest city is Vekllei in the Capital Region, which is home to two-thirds of the total population. The interior plateau of the Home Island consists of sand and lava fields, flower-tundras, glaciers, and temperate rainforests, and its lowlands are home to many glacial rivers.\nThe Home Island has been inhabited for at least four thousand years by Arctic peoples migrating from Kalalist (Greenland). Evidence of European settlement in Vekllei can be established from unearthed settlements dated 1230BC, when settlers from Ireland established fishing communities along the southern coast.

Broadly, Newda buildings emphasise distinction from the surrounding landscape (called Dumousiantopet, or ‚Äòbeautiful and seperate‚Äô), natural decay, and honesty in material and construction. Vekllei‚Äôs great Parliament House is Newda; as are the little rural homes found in the mountains inland in Vekllei.\nTzipora‚Äôs house in the village of Montre-Lola ( as depicted on the map here) is built in what Vekllei calls ‚ÄúAzores revivalism‚Äù, a Newda style heavily influenced by the stripped deco and streamline moderne buildings of a century prior. It is part of a constant conversation Newda holds with its past, as both a deeply modernist, progressive school and one bound up in the wider aesthetic and cultural traditions of Upen, the spiritualism of Vekllei.\nHer house is small, but appears larger due to the layout of the structure. A small sleeping loft sits atop the living, bathing and cooking areas of the home, and opens out into a private rooftop garden. The utilities tower also hides a small staircase leading to the roof, which is also accessible for outdoor recreation. Her home stands amidst the farmland of Montre-Lola, and very near the library and primary school where she works. Her property is marked at its end by a creek that runs into the Dentre River. She has a vegetable garden in her backyard, and shares her paddocks with her neighbours for grazing periodically throughout the year.\nHer house was erected in gratitude by her neighbours out of prefab components, and assisted by a ‚Äúconstruction line,‚Äù ‚Äî a temporary rail line in which goods are delivered and cranes are supported, minimising the need for lorries. Houses of this type and period are rarely seen in agricultural settings in other countries, but in Vekllei, where Landscape has been abolished, there might as well be no difference between a building suitable for the cosmopolitan, coastal cities and a dwelling for a farmer-girl.\n"});index.add({'id':16,'href':'/posts/2020-08-12-ageless/','title':"The Thousand-Year-Old Girl",'section':"Archive",'content':" The concept of living forever jumps out at people uncomfortable with their own existence. There is a contemplative instinct among educated people that ‚Äî if they could simply will themselves into a state of self-actualisation ‚Äî death would only be an obstacle to greatness.\nAs Tzipora found out quickly, the opposite was true ‚Äî death and temporality were wells of meaning against which all great people, beauty, and human constructions were cast.\nTzipora Desmoisnes is what is known as a Gregori Baby, a catch-all term for a unique genetic condition that has seemingly produced a variety of miracle children appropriate for the frothing futurism of the atomic age ‚Äî boys and girls who, suspended in the purity and good-naturedness of childhood ‚Äî live forever.\nThere is no single ‚ÄúGregori Baby‚Äù ‚Äî each is unique, and Tzipora is the 13th to have been recognised overall. The phrase is a shortening of Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome, a stand-in for medical information that isn‚Äôt there. The first, Gregori Hordiyenko, was born in 2024. He was healthy, and died of unrelated causes in his 20s. Tzipora, at 13th, continues to live to this day and is the oldest person on Earth.\nThere is a disturbing trend among the Gregori children, first heralded as miracles and symptoms of the space age, to deteriorate medically as more are born. The culprit is the malfunctioning of telomeres in their DNA ‚Äî the source of their longevity ‚Äî which regularly produce devastating chromosomal disorders, including Trisomy 13 \u0026amp; 18, killing most ‚Äúageless children‚Äù before their third birthday. Those that survive are often victims of a severe anaphylaxis caused by a hyperactive immune system ‚Äî rendering many of them permanently sickly. Others find themselves unageing, but continue to grow ‚Äî reaching as tall as 2.5m before their bodies give out from exhaustion and osteoporosis.\nSo what is Gregori syndrome? What does your average (healthy) Gregori baby look like? Their genetic miracle is linked to the structures of the body that activate at puberty, and so girls vary between 11-16 years of age at onset depending on many factors that affect their development. Boys tend to be a little younger, from 8-14. Between the two, girls tend to be more stable, and all but two of the supercentenarian Gregori children are female.\nAmong girls, they are prepubescent and generally stop ageing on the eve of menarche, or their first period. In Tzipora‚Äôs case, her body is estimated to be 13 years and 11 months old. Unlike many Gregori children, Tzipora lives in a wealthy country and has volunteered for extensive research into her genetic makeup, meaning that much of early medical documentation around Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome was received directly from her case.\nMost obvious is that, at a foundational level, her cells are similar in function to unipotent stem cells, and have been since hormones at the end of thelarche suspended her ageing. This change has occurred somewhere in her DNA ‚Äî exactly where is unknown ‚Äî but the end result is that, unlike regular progenitor cells that make up most adult bodies, the building blocks of her body are capable of cell-renewal. Her telomeres, the endcaps of chromosomal DNA in mammals, are undamaged. And so there is an amazing shift in her basic human structure ‚Äî in which human cell lineage, which usually ends in a mature cell incapable of division, is caught and rearranged. With this considered, it is no wonder that Gregori children suffer from such catastrophic chromosomal instability, and why healthy ageless babies are a rarity. Her body is not exactly a ‚Äúbody of stem cells,‚Äù but for their function in a healthy Gregori child, they might as well be.\nSo it is that nothing about Tzipora is changing. She suffers from pains in her legs often ‚Äî called growing pains, although they are not from growing ‚Äî and her cells continue to replenish, albeit at a rate 1.25 times that of normal people. She is, in essence, ‚Äúgrowing‚Äù as any other premenarchal girl would, but she is not getting bigger or becoming older.\nTzipora is blessed with an adult life in Vekllei, where the ‚ÄúChild‚Äù does not exist as it does in the West, and her individual freedoms are far-ranging. She may smoke, and drink, and has held many different jobs in her life. She holds two doctorates in English and Vekllei Literature. She is obviously sterile ‚Äî even if she were to somehow ‚Äúage out‚Äù of prepubescence into pubescence and receive the required hormones, she simply lacks the genetic code to reproduce ‚Äî but raises many children through her active participation in village life and her roles as Montre-Lola‚Äôs municipal and school librarian.\nIn other countries, with coded roles for children, their problems are much greater. Unable to form adult relationships and often incapable of finding work, many work in entertainment or fall into poverty as they outlive their friends and parents. Socially ostracised and forever young, many are victims of superstition and fear. As the pattern of Gregori children indicates an increase in mortality, even as more are born, their appearance is both a miracle and a tragedy ‚Äî ageing not through mitosis but through weathering the societies in which they live.\n"});index.add({'id':17,'href':'/posts/2020-08-09-spaceship/','title':"The 31st Century ‚Äî Vekllei throughout our Solar System",'section':"Archive",'content':" The Epoch of Rest #  We‚Äôve spent a lot of time in the 21st century ‚Äî but Tzipora is biologically immortal. Where does she go from here? Well, let‚Äôs enjoy a small glimpse at that future together, by winding the clock forward one thousand years.\nBy 3076, our Solar System is a pleasant place to be. Most of the planets we once gazed at from afar are now habitable and lived on. The Great Epoch of Rest has begun.\nThere is no great interstellar empire, no rise and fall of spacefaring supernations ‚Äî a Vekllei way of life is now lived out in multicultural, prosperous clusters of people across our Solar System. The ordinary person is afforded incredible freedoms previously reserved for science fiction through the accessibility of personal light spacecraft, translated literally as ‚Äúboats‚Äù.\nThis here is the M-7000 APRICOT, manufactured by the Government Aerospace Factories (GAF) of Vekllei. Many companies are contracted by the GAF, including General Reactor S.A., to whom this boat lends most of its flight control systems and all of its power plant. It is a light, personal boat for women built in 2807, making it relatively unique in both its 28th century design language and its gendered marketing. While the personal boat market was growing rapidly by this time, the vast majority of owners and pilots were men. The APRICOT set out to change that, and Tzipora, the world‚Äôs oldest living person with a youthful face, was among the first to demonstrate the accessibility and freedoms of space travel for women and girls in the personal boat market. It was her first boat, and despite its orientation for women it was christened with a male name: BARON.\nIt is a comfortable and pleasant craft that can be lived in for extended periods of time. Tzipora has done just that, travelling to stars in search of water-planets with Micronesian archipelagos, where she likes to spend most of her time. Its glass roof across the entire accessible cabin, including bubbled cockpit, gives it breathtaking visibility in the depths of space and the most scenic of planets alike. Like almost all spacecraft, it is unarmed, save for the pacifying ‚Äújazz‚Äù electric canon, named for its firing sound reminiscent of a double bass strum.\nWhen she tires of being alone, she returns to her hometown of Montre-Lola in Vekllei frequently. Boats are usually parked at off-world stations, preserving the aerospace and quiet of the Solar System.\nLight speed is exceeded through superluminal travel. So-called black boxes require extraordinarily precise programming, since superluminal travel is in all ways but name time travel, and the universe does not tolerate time travel. Coordinates calculated in the universal pyramid system by a pyramid computer ensure that a vessel arrives when it arrives, so to speak. The alternative is going nowhere at all ‚Äî there is no in-between.\nSuperluminal systems are affected by gravity, so any person looking to exceed the speed of light and subsequently visit other stars must take the highways beyond our home system‚Äôs planetary orbit and launch into so-called free-travel from there. There are only a handful of these highways ‚Äî the solar system is very, very large, and human construction is very, very small.\nThere was an instinct among many people that human progress would naturally scale exponentially ‚Äî these were extrapolated from the remarkable progress in the lifetime of Tzipora‚Äôs parents and grandparents, who saw canvas aircraft in their childhood advance to the landing of a man on the moon, and again in her own exaggerated lifetime, in which the provinciality of her youth has simultaneously seen an expansion and exploitation of the planets in our native solar system.\nThis curve of progress was not to be, however ‚Äî and it also explains why we had such trouble meeting aliens in the first place. Part of it was simply that there are very few worlds with water that also formed earthlike landmasses nearby ‚Äî there are many aliens, and Tzipora has seen many herself, but most of them are fish and fish-adjacent. The second is that, if there is civilised life out there, it has most probably encountered the same engineering truths that humanity did, in our great interstellar project of the last thousand years. Namely that, all accounted for, there is no use for wasteful megastructures when a small one will do. People are having less children ‚Äî on Mars, Mercury and Neptune, the population is actually shrinking. What good is the so-called ‚Äúocean liner of the stars,‚Äù with a capacity of millions? There are around 12 billion people across the solar system today. Maybe another 8 billion in the Ala system. Maybe a few millions more who have simply given up society for scattered stars in our neighbourhood.\nIt is likely that if any other civilised races exist, they are simply of our scale, or have destroyed themselves completely in the reckless pursuit of expansion. Humanity is lucky not to count themselves among them.\nThe APRICOT is one of many models produced by Vekllei‚Äôs Government Aerospace Factories. It is now possible for the ordinary person to explore distant stars for themselves, granting freedoms unimaginable in a previous age. Such is life in the Great Epoch of Rest.\n"});index.add({'id':18,'href':'/posts/2020-08-01-tzipora-concept/','title':"Meet Tzipora ‚Äî concept panel for a Vekllei comic",'section':"Archive",'content':" Unique among girls #  There are a lot of things Tzipora does differently to everybody else, and they start to make a lot more sense when you realise Tzipora either does not realise she is unusual, or does not care.\nShe has a lot of endearing characteristics that give great character to her mannerisms and physicality. She has a small overbite that makes her look a little froggy, and ritually pulls on her shirt and wipes her nose in anxious conversation. She is round-headed and cuts her hair herself. She talks in a low, expressive voice. She has been poorly socialised in childhood, and is afraid of casual conversation with people she does not know. She is keenly socially attuned and feels awkwardness painfully.\nShe wears the same clothes two or three days in a row. The outfits themselves are variations of the same thing, and her tastes don‚Äôt change. Everything hangs off her ‚Äî she likes baggy, airy clothing, and upsizes to accomodate. She doesn‚Äôt like fashionable or voguish people, whom she regards as decadent and offensive. To Tzipora, taste is timeless and bound to the soul. In her case, this fact has held true ‚Äî she has dressed the same as childhood, and very little else has changed about her in that time.\nShe is paranoid and conservative, good-natured and austere, with a moral outlook bound by her deepest anxieties and obsessions. She is deeply spiritual and material, fascinated with objects and their history. She has many collections of many things she‚Äôs found. She‚Äôll likely die a Catholic, but has a confrontational relationship with God and no longer attends mass, as a declaration of humanism.

Brief reprieves from the North Atlantic cold were granted to hundreds of thousands domestic tourists each year in resorts and holiday rentals alike. Tzipora spent the summer of 2079 there.

No food was ever left on her plate. There was a deep anxiety that whatever wasn‚Äôt claimed would be lost.\nShe was also naturally obsessive and material-oriented, keenly aware of the importance of objects measured by metrics in her own silly head. You can discover a lot about a person from their trinkets and toys ‚Äî let‚Äôs discover a bit about Tzipora.\n Her handbag is manufactured by Spaa S.p.A., a design firm in the capital. They‚Äôre a luxury item in the international market but readily available in Vekllei, since few other handbag makers operate on the scale of Spaa. Ayn picked it out shortly after Tzipora‚Äôs arrival for its colour, after Tzipora told her she did not own any red things. Tzipora has a sweet tooth. Especially for soda, which she calls ‚Äúfizzy drink‚Äù. On her person at any time, she carries a flavoured beverage from one of several brands capable of meeting her discerning tastes. She supplements them with a water bottle, since not even fizzy drink refreshes as well as water after phys-ed or a hot day. She also stocks her arsenal of snacks with good fruit picked off trees that overhang footpaths, as well as devastating salvos of Vekllei‚Äôs finest confectionary, including Fruit Tingles and chocolate pearls. Other girls in her class bemoan her childish metabolism as she drinks soda for lunch while they watch the scales. The nostalgic whimsy of the sweets is tempered by two or three loose cigarettes that float around in her purse at any given time. She‚Äôs not a regular smoker, but she‚Äôs prone to attacks related to stress, and nothing helps as much as a drag. She carries matches, for not much reason other than that‚Äôs what Baron uses, and Tzipora is notoriously sentimental. Tzipora has a rock collection that sits on her bedroom sill, and her recent additions sit at the bottom of her purse. She‚Äôs not a rock elitist; quartz from footpaths catches her attention as easily as igneous treasures like palagonite. Her favourite is obsidian. She carries a small collection of useful books, including a contemporary paperback and a notebook. The paperback is for recess and lunch; the notebook is for language notes and phone numbers. Her Vekllei I.D. papers, which are both a passport and a reference booklet of key information and services, are carried on her at all times. It‚Äôs not really necessary in day-to-day life ‚Äî but who knows when it might be, and Tzipora won‚Äôt be the one patting her pockets at the airport gate. Finally, there are a few accessories sitting in the bag. Tzipora made a ring for Cobian in metalworking class, but Cobian is on a school trip to France at the moment and Tzipora is waiting for her return. She has a wristwatch given to her by Baron, which she wears sometimes depending on the occasion. Other items are more precautionary ‚Äî a scarf for the wind, a handkerchief for sneezing, and a spare pair of socks for when she visits Cobian‚Äôs house or if she needs to double up in cold weather. As summer turns to autumn, she also carries gloves and a beanie.  With everything in its place, her handbag is her anchor in the world outside her small second-floor apartment. The decommodification of society has only intensified the social value of objects, and they remain as important as ever in the life of the ordinary Vekllei person.\n"});index.add({'id':22,'href':'/posts/2020-07-13-economy/','title':"The Race for Inefficiency ‚Äî Vekllei‚Äôs advocation of austerity, apathy, and playfulness as economic principles",'section':"Archive",'content':" This post is about the economy of Vekllei. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a long one. If you have any questions, just ask.\nOverview of the Bureau System #  There are many thousands of companies busy with work in Vekllei. The vast majority of these companies are single-person shops (S.p.A., or senrouiva pettetie anaproiouya). Also common are wobbly shops, or co-operative businesses (S.q.A., or senrouiva qualitie anaproiouya). The largest of the non-bureau companies are village factories (S.p.M., or senrouiva persimonaya manufacturie).\nThe bureau-level world is full of company mastheads that emphasise modernity, dynamism and progress. Vekllei‚Äôs ‚Äúprivate businesses‚Äù, however, tend to be local in taste. The vast majority of S.p.A. and S.q.A. businesses bear the family names of their founders ‚Äî Desmesyo S.p.A., Risyiouisnesn Home Machines S.q.A., etc. Their legal denominations are almost always affixed to the end of their nameplates.\nTheir senrouiva designation marks them as non-bureau businesses. A bureau, as a reminder, is simply the top-level organisation of a trade union that organises business in the country. In practice, it means that a company is responsible to the political organs of the country. Although independent from the government, bureau business is inextricably entwined in government concern and runs parallel to it.\nSenrouvia businesses are also part of the bureau structure, but are in practice not managed directly by them. They are usually united in local concern by so-called petty bureaus; small cooperative organs that safeguard local interest and business. These petty bureaus are often at odds with the bureau organs proper, and so even though they are part of the same structure, they are fundamentally political opposed.\nSo what is sort of business goes on in a bureau proper?\nThere are two common categories of so-called ‚Äúbureau firms‚Äù. You have state industries (S.A., or societie indastrie), which deal with manufacturing and exploitation of resources that require direct management by a public organ. You‚Äôll already be familiar with several ‚Äî General Reactor S.A., Comen Aeroyards S.A., Farmer‚Äôs Syndicate S.A. to name a few.\nYou also have state requisites (A.r., or requoisesiasn amourisocietie), which refer to the vast government-operated organs made up six categories primarily.\n Utilities (A.r.Un.) Transport (A.r.R.) Education (A.r.E.) Local healthcare (A.r.F.) Construction (A.r.Lo.) Automation (A.r.M.)  Yes ‚Äî education is not organised as a government department, but a bureau business. Other state responsibilities are folded directly into government departments ‚Äî war, intelligence, healthcare, police, fire, and the mint are all managed directly by the government.\nArgument #  With the legal division of enterprise laid out, let us examine again the four precepts of the Vekllei economic ideology.\n Self-management and self-interest through Sundress Municipalism. Classification of property as an independent social organ, like nature. Abolishment of currency and currency-substitutes. Participatory employment. Economic feminisation.  These four principles reveal a great deal about the character of the country, and stand largely at face value. There is an interest in chasing the promises of modernity while deconstructing its metaphysical constructions, through the abolishment of exchange-value, property and the overhaul of gender-economics. There are anarchist gestures in each principle, yet it is obvious that the product of these values complexify the conventional anarchist imagination. This is part of a series of contradictions ‚Äî between free and planned markets, between internationalism and provinciality, between man and woman, between freedom and security.\nAusterity #  The bureau system is plagued by inefficiencies, arising from logistic systems premised on warehousing, poor Coasean bargaining between petty bureaus and proper bureaus, a political emphasis on macroeconomic outcomes, a decoupling of aggregate demand and national economic output, cultural intolerance for Pareto inefficiencies, etc.\nLuxury goods often vary in both supply and access, and economies are often severely localised to the point of provincialism, meaning that Vekllei has failed to transition reliably to a modern consumer society. The inhabitants of the Montre borough most often eat seafood because speciality meats, especially authentic red meat, are scarce. The opposite is true in Yana. Clothes are repaired and regifted, appliances are available only from regional outlets usually located in the same city as the factory, and culture and diet are fiercely regional.\nThis is, in part, a result of unflinching national austerity and the sublimation of artificial markets prompted by Vekllei‚Äôs gold-based auxiliary currency, which necessitates meeting debt obligations for its strength internationally. There is a belief in Vekllei that the wealth of the country allowed the abolition of the currency ‚Äî in fact, the opposite is true. The abolition of currency allows a permanent wealth that compensates for the inefficiencies of the bureau system. The bureau firms do not pay their workers ‚Äî on paper, there are no expenses for anything beyond raw commodity exchange. This is how Vekllei‚Äôs largest companies ‚Äî and, per the bureau system, its government ‚Äî remain solvent.\nAusterity is a cultural force, too ‚Äî the scarcity of luxury goods inflates their social value, where comforts and necessities are largely abundant in automation. It creates an unimportant hardship that keeps Vekllei people forward-facing, lean, and ambitious. To acquire Picco S.p.A.‚Äôs iconic lounge chairs, you have to travel to their outlet in Horn, hundreds of kilometres from the capital area. There is no motivation for a craftsman to meet demand ‚Äî there is no petty consumption, either. To own a Picco chair means you have understood its cultural value, utility and craftsmanship, and have made the effort to find and transport one to your home. Inconvenience, and by extension, austerity, is celebrated as a ‚Äútrial of ownership.‚Äù Objects are very important in Vekllei, and craftsmanship is highly valued, and so people like to surround themselves with hand-made, sublime things wrought not just by the labour of the artisan, but their own effort to acquire it.\nPetty austerity instills a national sentiment that tells the ordinary Vekllei person they are hardier than the ordinary American or European, even if the wealth of the ordinary Vekllei person is much greater than that of the ordinary American or European.\nApathy #  Despite a vast, loosely organised private market in the senrouiva categorisation, Vekllei does not reward entrepreneurial ambition. Ambitious people are funnelled into positions of power in bureau firms and political office, but the founding of S.p.As and S.q.As is rarely motivated by a desire for influence or power. Indeed, artisanal S.p.As are often incapable of the sort of economies of scale needed for expansion. Vekllei instead relies on a sort of economic apathy, in which aggregate demand and productivity are spurned for immediate interest and pleasure.\nThis ensures that\n luxury products remain creative, personal works per Upen‚Äôs insistence on the symbiosis of labour and product the private senrouiva market is not capable of threatening the provincialism of Sundress Municipalism, which might make a commodity universally accessible and threaten to introduce generic consumer society into Vekllei life the private senrouiva market under petty bureau organisation does not threaten the organised de facto monopolies of the bureau companies  If Vekllei has replaced the commodity with the object, then it is through economic apathy that they have ensured objects will never again become commodities. Just as the ordinary Vekllei person is apolitical, so too are they apathetic towards change in their purchasing habits, favouring small, inconvenient and personal brands over those exploiting aggregate demand. In a sense, this also contributed to the popular Vekllei term product atheism, in which the metaphysics of products are dismantled and rearranged into social forms.\nIn this sense, the apathy is found on both ends ‚Äî within the senrouiva business owner, who is provided little upward mobility to satisfy ambition beyond local and regional expansion, and within the consumer, who recognises products only within cultural and social dimensions. Neither is conducive to a functioning, fair market on an interregional scale.\nPlay #  Play is the foundational motivation of most work in Vekllei. There are existential motivators, too ‚Äî a desire to wield power, or professional legacy ‚Äî but in many professions it is play by which a Vekllei person justifies labour. It is also why work is fiercely protected by petty bureaus and other labour organisations ‚Äî work is their connection to wider society, and that connection is held sacred in Upen.\nIt is through work as play that Vekllei is able to justify the employment of children. Financial motivations for work have all but disappeared ‚Äî in its place, the workplace has to convince people to work. There are few state protections for businesses unable to maintain a workforce, either ‚Äî it is one of the most common reasons for the shuttering of a company. The boss must convince his workers to stay, and so a total inversion of power has occurred.\nIn place of money, there is prestige, and in prestige there is myth. Few people have genuine interest in Fordism. Many more are attracted to the hand-crafted furniture of Picco S.p.A., and becoming recognised as a builder of great things. In a sense, a person ‚Äúacts out‚Äù the role of a craftsman, in the same way a person ‚Äúacts out‚Äù the role of a police officer, or ‚Äúacts out‚Äù life as a pilot.\nIn this system, the childish spirit of recreation, duty and ‚Äúthe adult world‚Äù is acted out by millions of Vekllei people each day. Seeds planted by a child play-acting as a farmer continue to grow, and so too does the Vekllei economy feed its population through the intersection of fantasy and labour. At this point it is obvious that play is not fantasy at all, but in fact a motivation for labour as genuine as profit. Where it falls short, in hard, disempowering jobs, it is automated and conscripted through the mandatory service system. As it is often described:\n‚ÄúThe Bureau System is labour-intensive where wanted, alleviated by industrial machinery where preferred, and automated where necessary.‚Äù\nIn its wake are states of play, and through play comes a decent framework for living, obvious in the basic satisfaction of the Vekllei people.\n"});index.add({'id':23,'href':'/posts/2020-07-08-police/','title':"Police in Vekllei",'section':"Archive",'content':" There are two regular police organs in Vekllei.\n Fedecenoayan porits (national police, or venopor) Comoisniyan denporitsa (local police, or cosmopor)  A young venopor officer stands on the left, in the full street regalia they‚Äôre renowned for. Unlike cosmopor, they often carry machine guns while on patrol and are stationed outside of government buildings, hospitals, train stations, ports, schools and any company managed directly by a bureau, which is a trade organ of national importance. They are special units of special purpose, and supplement the deficiencies of local policing through their training and tactical deployment.\nThey are police insofar as they protect and respond to their community, including through special tactics situations, but are paramilitary in their wider function as a defence force for critical infrastructure. This is reflected in their history, traced cleanly back past independence and the Atomic War to the royal guards and junta federal police of old society, which continue to be reflected in their uniforms and several other ceremonial artefacts, like swords and knee boots. Venopor is a complex organisation with many different purposes. There are street patrols, pictured here, but there are also intelligence units associated with HO/NI and by extension the military, as well as tactical response teams, bomb squads, search and rescue and most other specialised emergency units outside of the capabilities of any given local police station.\nThis is contrast to the cosmopor, a more conventional police outfit. A cosmopor officer stands on the right, in standard summer uniform. He carries a radio, revolver and rubber baton for the worst of his duties, and is embedded deep into his local community. Cosmopor officers traditionally visit and introduce themselves to each house in their beat, and spend far more of their time mediating, counselling and organising than they do making arrests. The autonomy of most Vekllei communities largely spurns petty legal proceedings, and so the cosmopor are a critical aspect of sundress municipalism, resolving disputes personally and taking custody of a person only when it‚Äôs needed. Most crime in Vekllei tends to be emotionally motivated ‚Äî so it is in this domain that cosmopor navigate.\nThis makes the cosmopor especially powerful figures in a Vekllei village or township, but their duties are closely watched. While the Vekllei village may be autonomous, all officers in Vekllei are responsible to a division of venopor called ‚Äúofficer welfare,‚Äù or picosec, which operates autonomously to seek out incompetent or misbehaving police officers, no matter their jurisdiction or status. Where most business in Vekllei has very little in the way of professional behaviour or ‚Äúwork culture‚Äù, policing in Vekllei is held to high standards, and they are severely bound by traditions that have become codified as the country has grown. This is a time and place where the children of police often inherit the jobs of their parents, and the constables of a village often have roots that go back centuries. This often makes cosmopor very respected figures, and their successors and recruits are expected to work for that respect.\nIn a country that has done away with money as a measure of success, professional legacy is profoundly important in Vekllei. In this inversion of priority, teachers, doctors, pilots, constables and librarians are celebrated. This is not founded in a general egalitarianism, but in fact the precise opposite ‚Äî a celebration of success and influence, touching the lives of those around them. The glamour, and paycheque, has largely been stripped away. Only the work remains, and so that work has become more important than ever.\n"});index.add({'id':24,'href':'/posts/2020-06-14-map/','title':"A Map of Vekllei ‚Äî 100 Boroughs; 100 Hearts",'section':"Archive",'content':" Map Key\n Red: Magjet trains, 750km/h\nYellow: Bullet trains, 300-400km/h\nOrange: Regional trains, \u0026lt;150km/h\nBrown: Local trains, including limited express, \u0026lt;100km/h\nBlue: National highway\nDashed: Ferry line\nGreen: tarmacadamed airport\n The largest division of any portion of Vekllei land is the borough; a region of varying size and population with common culture, food dependency and economic interest. Anything larger than that is simply Vekllei ‚Äî they are ‚Äúone city‚Äù, after all, and consider themselves a city-state.\nThere have been exactly 100 boroughs since 2015. Each is named after the largest city in its region.\n The smallest borough is Bakur, in Afouismeh, with a population of 7,500 people. The largest is Vekllei proper, in the Capital Region, of 2.4 millions.  This transit map illustrates all 100 boroughs, Vekllei‚Äôs five tallest mountains, its permafrost glaciers and Tzipora‚Äôs home in Montre-Lola. Her five largest boroughs ‚Äî namely Vekllei, Lonne, Adouisneh, Montre and Copette, are highlighted.\nEven in this simple transit map we can see several truths about the country, like its population bias on the West Coast and the emptiness of the Lava volcanic region. You might recognise a few names there, like Lola in the West (Tzipora‚Äôs home with Baron) and Yana in Vekllei‚Äôs Ro Highlands (Ayn‚Äôs birthplace).\nTrains are clean, reliable, fast, efficient and safe. They are incorporated under Vekllei Rail, owned by the Transport Group Bureau. Using this map, designed for domestic tourists and foreigners, the adequacy of Vekllei‚Äôs rail transport is easy to plan around ‚Äî you can eat breakfast in a cafe in the seaside town of Mumen, and hike before midday on the glacial slopes of Askayoisn. Since there are no tickets or costs, there are no excuses for not visiting relatives in the country, now that transport is now a trivial inconvenience.\nEach borough is represented in Vekllei‚Äôs parliament by an elected representative. These representatives wield extraordinarily disproportionate power ‚Äî the representative for Callaisn, for example, represents hundreds of times more people than the representative for Tanger, but both have the same vote. This is because boroughs are not just representative of their populations, but also their environments, industry and other social organs otherwise unable to vote. It is important to keep in mind that Upen (and consequently, policy) recognises the landscape itself as the sovereign organ of the country, and so in this sense it has its own interests and projections.\nIn practice, representatives act in an advisory, nonpartisan role in government, voting rarely in an auxiliary role to the professionalised, elected legislature. Vekllei has a strictly constitutional parliament, and the economy largely prohibits interference. In this sense, the parliament is both partially undemocratic in its inefficiency and apolitical in its orientation as a sort of civil service bureau, managing state affairs and reacting to pressures and the long-term aims outlined in the 2015 constitution. In the Vekllei mindset, the ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù is more or less another bureau, no different or particularly more interesting than the Transport Group Bureau. The trains, at least, have a tangible impact on their daily lives.\nHow appropriate, then, that this transit map produced in the summer months of 2076 combines both monuments of society. It also offers a glimpse of a larger, documented country not necessarily revealed in piecemeal story posts.\n"});index.add({'id':25,'href':'/posts/2020-06-24-crown/','title':"The Vekllei Crown ‚Äî coins of a moneyless country",'section':"Archive",'content':" Vekllei, legendarily, does not use circulate currency.

At no point do coins or paper currency change hands in the day-to-day affairs of the country.\nIn this sense, Vekllei is usually described as ‚Äúmoneyless‚Äù ‚Äî yet it does in fact have a currency. The Vekllei Kroner, or ‚ÄúCrown,‚Äù is hundreds of years old, and Vekllei still operates a mint for currency. At any time, a Vekllei person can write to the National Mint and order a set of coins, like the ones pictured above. So what is going on here?\nAlthough the Kroner has not been used since 2022, after the last village in Stochi returned coinage to the Mint, it continues to exist to this day as a gold-backed currency in the International Market, through which Vekllei trades with other countries. The physical coins, produced mostly as a novelty in the tradition of mayaesdiou (medallions, or small metal pieces commonly collected and given in Vekllei), are a physical coinage of the International Market. The coins also operate as a form of bullion, or wealth reserve, since each coin is worth exactly its face value in gold. Since the International Market is completely closed and independent of the domestic economy, its value is controlled directly by the so-called Government Bank. It is one of the few gold-backed currencies in a developed nation today.\nTo further complicate things, there are actually two different Kroner in Vekllei. There is the Vekllei Kroner, which represents the International Market, but there is also a seperate Government/State Kroner, which is not minted and used only as an investment mechanism, backed by government \u0026ldquo;white bonds\u0026rdquo; which are usually measures of labour-hours or refined materials. It is, in a sense, a fiat currency alongside a gold-backed currency.\nThey exist independently because they are used for two seperate purposes. The Vekllei Kroner is used a wealth reserve and bullion, and also represents the collective wealth of the Vekllei people. Each citizen, in theory, is entitled to an equal share of the Government Bank, although it can only be withdrawn as currency in specific circumstances. Vekllei also holds substantial amounts of foreign currency in the Government Bank and Vekllei Kroner, which is used to invest and stabilise holdings and capital in foreign countries. The Government Kroner, on the other hand, is used as an investment mechanism abroad, usually in support of infrastructure. It is also used to acquire foreign currencies through investment in foreign capital.\nDespite having two currencies, neither the \u0026ldquo;Vekllei Crown\u0026rdquo; or the \u0026ldquo;Government Crown\u0026rdquo; are used in the domestic economy in Vekllei, which is autonomous and not subject to a central bank. So it is that Vekllei‚Äôs currency is both little more than a novelty and essential to the function of the country in a world still ruled by money.\n In the coinage depicted above ‚Äî 8 coins are minted in Vekllei today. They were designed in 2015, in the year of independence. They represent eight core values in the country.\nThe ‚Äúsmall crowns,‚Äù worth 1VK and 10VK respectively, represent fraternity and liberty, two founding elements of the Vekllei constitution. The 50VK coin is plated in silver and has a small ruby inset. Rubies are used to represent energy, in this case, the vitality of the spirits, which dominate Upen and the Vekllei landscape. The 100, 200, 500 and 1,000VK coins represent different landscapes of the country. As a volcanic island nation, the ocean (100) and landscape (200) coins are fairly straightforward. The humanity coin (500) represents the Vekllei people and ancestry ‚Äî note how humans are placed alongside other natural forces. The flower coin (1,000VK) represents the flowers of the country, which are important spiritually and have formed part of the Vekllei identity. Vekllei has the most flowers per capita in the world. The final, larger 10,000VK coin represents the previous seven together, as a total sum of Vekllei landscape and identity.\n To answer Tzipora‚Äôs question ‚Äî a bottle of fizzy drink cost about 2VK in the waning days of coinage in the early 2020s.\n"});index.add({'id':26,'href':'/posts/2020-06-29-montrelola/','title':"Village Map of Montre-Lola",'section':"Archive",'content':" The village of Montre-Lola is home to about 400 people in its entirety, a stone‚Äôs throw from the Aisyo borough. Each morning, however, the population swells as 300 children from tiny villages in both Aisyo and Montre take a fast tram to the Montre-Lola Area School No. 2, a district school raising all ages of local youth.\nLike many Vekllei villages, Montre-Lola‚Äôs history is complex and has origin stories in both viking-inuit settlement as well as less sentimental government programmes that flourished after the atomic war. By historical accounts, Montre-Lola has been inhabited since at least 1500CE. By contemporaneous records, however, it was established as a village in land reform during the 1960s and revitalised by the building of the area school in 2057.\nMontre-Lola features many civic objects common to Vekllei villages ‚Äî a nondenominational place of worship (in this case, a historical Catholic church), a constabulary, a doctor, an auto/tractor pool, a general store, a station platform, and a village hall. A map of the village centre is dominated by the Area School, built in an Edunewda style, which features many new facilities that distinguish it from smaller, 20th-century schools. It‚Äôs a good place to grow up; where farmland and earnest modernity collide.\n Montre-Lola is most relevant as the residence of Tzipora Desmoisnes, the world‚Äôs oldest person and one of the first people to be diagnosed with Gregori-Heitzfeld Syndrome. She works as a librarian in both the Montre-Lola Area School and the Montre-Lola Library \u0026amp; Archives, spending most of her 12-hour workday in either of these institutions. She commutes via fast trams, which arrive automatically at the two platforms in Montre-Lola every half-hour and continue out into the surrounding farms. This means that, if she sets her watch right, she can step outside her front door and arrive at the school library in under ten minutes. This journey is marked in red on the map above.\n Dominated by farmland, Montre-Lola is communal and more traditionally ‚Äòanarchist‚Äô in flavour than Vekllei‚Äôs urban boroughs, which are obscured by convenience. As charming as it is suffocating, the community is very close-knit and made up of all sorts ‚Äî smart educated young men and women sent from Montre to teach, as well as farming families that have resided here for centuries. Life moves slower and people know each other. When the school hosts its cross-country race each year, nearly every person in the village is out to watch it.

Baron might have rescued her, but it was Ayn who introduced her to Vekllei, as AB/NI called Baron into office for the first time in a decade. It was Ayn who took her clothes shopping and wrestled with Zelda‚Äôs obsessive-compulsive fabric requirements. It was Ayn who taught Tzipora her first Vekllei sentence. And in the end, it was Ayn who convinced Baron that he had to take responsibility for Tzipora.\nIt was only years later that Tzipora began to realise that Ayn and Baron were, in a sense, married to each other through their work. They worked closely (he as recent head of operations at AB/NI, she as a research analyst in American economics) and their friendship went back decades.

As an island nation with a large and multifaceted naval armada, the Oa-Class Battlecruiser is the heart of her armed forces, as the flagship of her fleets.\nWhere U.S. doctrine places carriers offensively in the structure of its ship-groups, the Vekllei Navy is considerably more Soviet in its employ of carriers as primarily defensive air-bases to exercise sovereignty over her far-flung territories and island possessions. Oa-class Battlecruisers are notable as hybrid carrier-battleships, and feature a diagonal jetway with capacity for carrier-type naval jets (almost indistinguishable in the illustration above) and a variety of VTOL aircraft, which are common by the 2050s.\nFirst built in the 2050s by the sprawling National Naval Arsenal (located on Vekllei‚Äôs Far East coast, close to the foundries that pour her iron), 12 Oa-Class Battlecruisers are in service in the 2070s. They carry heavy fission reactors built by bureau monopoly General Reactor, supplemented by a gas-turbine generator, as is standard on all Vekllei-built nuclear vessels. Her unusual serpentine funnel is characteristic of Vekllei‚Äôs navy, and is a distinguishing feature of their naval design language.\nHer hulking superstructure and massive 15-inch fore guns recall the capital battleships of yesteryear, but she is a thoroughly modern battlecruiser with contemporary armament and electrics for combat and fleet administration. Named after Vekllei‚Äôs National flower, these Battlecruisers are the third-largest vessels in the navy and are multifunctional by design, often operated as strategic and operational platforms to support Vekllei‚Äôs large defensive armadas that patrol the North Atlantic.\n She is armed with two triple-barrelled 15-inch shore guns that can be loaded with a variety of shells including nuclear payloads, silos for guided missiles, and specialised guns and missile platforms for anti-ship, submarine and satellite warfare. Her powerful communications array and sensors are positioned 80 meters above the surface for the benefit of radar and subsurface monitoring. She can also support up to 12 standard carrier jets at one time, or 16 individual helijets/VTOL craft.\n Vekllei has larger battlecruisers (the so-called super-battlecruisers match her height and are nearly twice her length) and much larger carriers, but the displacement of the vessel was never a priority. Vekllei‚Äôs naval architecture prioritises mobility and capability in their capital ships, and so the Oa-class vessels represent many intersecting vertices of Vekllei‚Äôs naval doctrine.\n"});index.add({'id':29,'href':'/posts/2020-06-03-canal/','title':"Canal Living",'section':"Archive",'content':" Atlantic Salmon was the best in the world, and Vekllei had a lot of it. Ocean-going fishing boats brought their haul to Ro, where they cruised wide postwar canals and unloaded tonnes of shiny, bright salmon into processing plants. If a new factory was built, so too was a canal or a railroad. Nothing was trucked. Fish was traded fresh in markets or turned into emulsifiers and fertiliser.\nThe canals were worked heavily, and few fishing vessels were incorporated. The vast majority of Vekllei‚Äôs fishing fleet was owned by the people that worked them, trading with the Sea Office. From a quaisiosn or ‚Äúcanal park‚Äù you might see a dozen vessels in an hour. Some were run-down prewar things limping out to the shallow coasts, while others were nuclear-powered salmon trawlers designed for the storms of the Atlantic. On the northern coast, the bigger boats were reinforced as ice-breakers. Fish was one of the few meats in the Vekllei diet that wasn‚Äôt grown in an industrial laboratory, a fact reflected in the scale of its infrastructure.\nCanals are good for a city, and are good for the heart. Tzipora would take long walks in the morning along the Wellington Canal to where it met Touismah, then follow it to where it circled back into Lola. She would figure out what she was doing with her life as the boats departed for the day‚Äôs catch. She never much liked salmon, but she liked the boats.

It was an incredible sight on a day so clear you could see the gentle curve of the earth where it met the horizon. A flash of light and a spray dome surged outwards into the quiet Atlantic, which was broken apart by plumes that formed a column of water that climbed high into the sky. The lateral plumes, the ‚Äúmushroom‚Äù, reached far across the horizon, forming thick clouds that would begin to rain into the sea. From the coast, fifteen kilometres away, a warm light bathed observers and was followed a moment later by a bang that deeply shook you and those around you.

The world may be warmer, but Vekllei‚Äôs polar latitude is unchanged, and in the depths of winter the sun only rises for an hour a day. These are Vekllei‚Äôs ‚Äúmoon months‚Äù, and they announce some of the most important spiritual festivals in Upen.\n Although school hours are reduced in winter, life carries on and Vekllei fashion becomes traditionally utilitarian. Tzipora has poor circulation and cold hands even in the warm months, and by November she‚Äôs traded the skirt and gi for traditional rouisha trousers and a cloak. Rouisha, like a lot of traditional clothing, have origins in agriculture and are characterised by a loose, baggy fit and insulated lining.

His uncle‚Äôs apartment had been built and furnished in 2031, and so it had a #2031 Colour Profile.\n In some ways, it was a very conventional apartment in the Vekllei tradition. It had a sauna and bath in the wetroom, a bidet, a sunken living room and a bread oven. In others, it was more peculiar. The apartment was bizarrely allocated across three levels. You alighted the entrance light well into a sunken living space, then climbed back up into the kitchen. The main living room and master bedroom were another step above the kitchen. Adjacent to the main living area was a closet and study, which overlooked the entrance from a half-meter mezzanine.\nIt was in this study that Tzipora set up shop when she arrived in March 2063. Baron had been reluctant to take her even provisionally, not least because it would mean searching for a new apartment in his busy return period after being abroad for ten years. Tzipora, however, had lived in a dormitory for much of her life and had settled in the alcove once she acquired a dresser screen. She refused outright the master bedroom, which sparked a sleepy agoraphobia. By the time Baron had made other accomodations, Tzipora had entrenched herself in the neighbourhood and had developed a severe sentimentality about the apartment and its rivulet, and so that was where he lived for the rest of his life.\nIn this sense, Tzipora had a strange kinship with the apartment. Baron sealed himself off in the master bedroom each night, but she never left the main living space.

She looked across a beach of black sand and saw some sort of operation playing out ‚Äî there was a gun boat not too far from the shore, and a police hydrofoil beached on the sand. She counted maybe a dozen officers. She wondered if they‚Äôd arrest her if she walked down to see what was happening. She climbed onto the hood of the cruiser to get a better look.

She was a quiet misandrist, which would have been fine if she could play the part of a self-assured social matriarch, but her mother‚Äôs despotic conservatism struck out that possibility early on.

Cobian‚Äôs mother asked Tzipora to remove her shoes and socks and wash her feet before going to play inside. By the time Tzipora found Cobian in her room, the girl had already changed and handed over her uniform to be laundered. Tzipora, in her tomboyish indigence, had never encountered such a brutally hygienic regime.\nCobian was a different girl at home. Her anxiety and neurosis washed out a little, and her confidence was propped up by the routines her mother had set out for her since she was a child. There was a friendly, curious girl buried under a decade of loneliness.\n Tzipora wondered what Cobian thought about lying in bed at night, and why the girl worried so much about things that didn‚Äôt matter. And it was precisely in the smallness of those things and the tremendous anxiety Cobian owed toward them that made Tzipora want to hug her. To be so worked up over something so pathetic was startlingly moving. The idea that the girl had deluded herself into a corner of hopelessness seemed sad ‚Äî and the fact that no one would reasonably care about such a feeble, meaningless, self-inflicted state of affairs made it tragic.\nThrough Tzipora‚Äôs friendship and the world it opened up for her, some of Cobian‚Äôs edges were sanded down. Some of it was a late maturity ‚Äî some of it was Tzipora‚Äôs dismantling of the scaffolding the girl‚Äôs mother had shoved in there. With that effort, and obvious love, Cobian‚Äôs reason for being changed too. One day, in Tzipora‚Äôs presence, it didn‚Äôt seem so important to be liked by everybody anymore.\n"});index.add({'id':39,'href':'/posts/2019-08-16-station-dog/','title':"The People of Vekllei‚Äôs Railway (plus Dog)",'section':"Archive",'content':" Station Dogs #  I‚Äôm starting a series looking at the lives and machines of domestic Vekllei life.\nVekllei National Railways, or ‚ÄòVK Rail‚Äô was the bastard of six major pre-war rail companies that were extinguished along with the society that housed them. Today there are three rail companies in Vekllei, but all of them operate under direct supervision of a Vekllei Industry Bureau ( making it Venrouiva, in other words) and are only broken up for reasons of logistics. So even though a train may run under the Montre Inclinantor Rail Company, it is fundamentally a Vekllei National Railways train much in the same way that all regional airlines are actually fully subsumed by Vekllei International Airways.\nA few characters you‚Äôll find at every manned Vekllei station have been illustrated below.\nThe first, the locomotive engineer, drives a train in four hour shifts. They wear a shoulder plate to distinguish them from other miscellaneous station staff and carry a pedigree in Vekllei culture, as a country dependent almost entirely on rail internally.\nEach station has a station master, who manages the station. In small stations, they do many types of work including maintenance and assisting public enquiry. In large stations, like Vekllei Central Terminus, there are dozens of station masters commanding multiple platforms each and are extremely demanding jobs.\nMost stations also have a most unusual employee, nicknamed in Vekllei a ‚Äòdaughter‚Äô or ‚Äòson of the station,‚Äô who are usually children or teen-agers particularly interested in entering employment with Vekllei Rail and are thus apprenticed in many different roles. They are usually taught some English in a special extracurricular programme and are used as guides for tourists, as Vekllei signage is usually written only in the country‚Äôs native tongue. After a few hours of miscellaneous works a child of the station might ride the trains, checking carriages and platforms for cleanliness and observing passenger behaviour.\nMore recently, stations have been adopting station dogs to help lift spirits among commuters and tourists alike. These dogs, usually of breeds too large for Vekllei apartment lifestyles, have no work but to meet people and offer pets to passing commuters. Some are trained in rescue and as service dogs to those who need them, but for the most part they are simply large dogs in uniform who wander with the station master or child of the station to look for love from strangers.\nAt nearly 20,000kms of rail, Vekllei has one of the most dense and intricate rail systems in the world. Stations are built to receive modern transonic maglevs and century-old steam engines simultaneously, and nearly 15,000 people are employed in some form to keep these railways running.\n"});index.add({'id':40,'href':'/posts/2019-07-26-what-is-vekllei/','title':"What is Vekllei?",'section':"Archive",'content':"Vekllei is a country in my alt-world; a utopian fever dream of googie aesthetics, participatory economics and nostalgia.\nWelcome to the ‚ÄòPetticoat Project‚Äô, a collection of stories about a country and a girl.¬†The concept is broken down into three sections:\n Author:¬†for blog posts and articles on the Petticoat Project, utopian fiction, personal news item, etc. Character:¬†for posts about Tzipora, people in her life, or otherwise events that occur during her time on Earth. Landscape:¬†for articles on Vekllei and her society, incorporating all that goes with it.  Otherwise, read on for an introduction to this project and what I intend to do with it.\n The Epilogue to the Epoch of Rest #  The core of the Vekllei project¬†is in understanding utopian fiction as a viable means for expressing yourself in two arenas.¬†Creative, as a way of articulating a worldview, and personal, as a way of introspection and projection.\nIn this case, the creative worldview is that of Vekllei ‚Äî a thought experiment in economics, socialpolitik, infrastructure, architecture, demographics, spirituality, language, actualisation, etc. The personal product is Tzipora ‚Äî a character of good mannerisms, language, sense of fashion, ideological disposition, personality and body.\n The premise of an epoch of rest is that the problems unique to an author, the conductor of the orchestra, can be reasoned with and turned into beautiful monuments in a way they can‚Äôt in reality.\n Running low on money? Vekllei does not use money ‚Äî go to a cinema, eat out; have a nice time. Likewise, are you shameful of your body or your ability? Tzipora is fraught with problems, too ‚Äî but look at her!¬†She is beautiful. Repeat this process for all creative arenas and you will find a world you can escape to, away from the problems of your reality.\nKeep in mind that utopia and perfection are two different things.¬†A city can be utopian without it being perfect ‚Äî a relative judgement. Carrying on in this sense, the concept of utopia can equally be applied to a person. The character is not necessarily a romantic interest or charming or intelligent or sexual product, because none of those things really describe utopia ‚Äî instead, a person (a utopian?) is perfect as a collection of ideas and experience. Vekllei is a place of utopia, Tzipora is utopian. And so there are three actors in this project.\nThe Author #  The producer of the whole thing, the creative and personal products are theirs, as unique as a fingerprint. They most likely produce a lot of different societies and characters in trying to tell a story, or flesh out an idea they‚Äôve had ‚Äî but for the purposes of the idea of an epoch of rest, there are two perfect utopias: landscape (society and the world), and character (personality and appearance).\nVekllei [/v∆êk.la…™/] #  Vekllei is a country in which the external burdens of the world can be shifted. Worries are relegated to the personal ‚Äî an arena in utopian fiction that conveniently still falls under the domain of the author. In Vekllei, self-actualisation is tangible, vivid, only metres away. It might be in creativity or power or love, but it is attainable, because the economic and cultural orchestra of the country is in the imagination of the author, and so it is perfect as by definition of utopia.\nTzipora/Zelda Desmoines [/dz…™pÀà…îÀêr.…ô‚Äôd∆êm.w…ôÀên.∆êÀêh/] #  If Vekllei is the arena of external burden, Tzipora is a girl on which the internal pressures of self-doubt and conscious flaw are cast aside like a rag. In the sense of a narrative, Tzipora might suffer because of her behaviours (her nervous tics, her jealousy, her body and image), but they are adopted in a way that is graceful. So despite her fierce problems, it fades away in the fact that she will not die; she will not be unsuccessful; she will not be unloved. As long as those core premises are true, then every other nervous tic or obsessive-compulsive behaviour are commodity; window-dressing to an aesthetic taste.\nThis project is sort of what I want to do, and I can‚Äôt imagine slowing down anytime soon. Stick around and I‚Äôll do my best materialise the world and story of Vekllei. Thanks for stopping by.\nKind regards,\nHobart Phillips\nMelonKony\n"});index.add({'id':41,'href':'/posts/','title':"Archive",'section':"Zelda Wiki",'content':"Welcome to MillMint\u0026rsquo;s Blog.\n"});})();
