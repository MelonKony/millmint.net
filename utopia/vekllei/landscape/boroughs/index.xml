  ߷ This article is about a &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;borough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By the sea, sea, sea, you&amp;rsquo;ll find a boy, boy, boy, and his heart, heart, heart, lies with his boat, boat, boat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;Memories of the Sea&lt;/em&gt;, Tohs Viskaismesn, 1952&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;fc&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;he borough of Bakur&lt;/strong&gt; is an administrative region on the far northwest coast of Vekllei, located in the Afouismeh Region north of Tanger and south of &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/boroughs/eyri/&#34;&gt;Eyri&lt;/a&gt;. It is named after Bakur, an ancient fishing town with history that predates unified settlement in Vekllei. It has the smallest population of any borough in Vekllei, at only 7,500 permanent residents, which fluctuates seasonally. It is most famous for being home to the site of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Deep-Sea Cartography Mission, an initiative of the Ocean Office of the Vekllei Government. This also means Bakur has the highest population of scientific personnel per capita of any borough in Vekllei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artefacts recovered from north of the town of Aya in Bakur date to nearly 1000BC, approaching earliest estimates of known settlement in the Vekllei Home Islands. Bakur&amp;rsquo;s first residents were likely nomadic arctic peoples immigrating from nearby Kala (Greenland) looking for hunting grounds in winter. Sagas confirm the town of Bakur was established in the 14th Century AD to support the creation of an arctic naval fort, but the fort was abandoned less than a hundred years later and few residents remained, leaving Bakur mostly abandoned until the early 19th Century, when it was reestablished as a base of operations for Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s colonial whaling fleet. Today it remains a shrinking fishing town, bolstered only by seasonal workers imported by the Ocean Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The town is the birthplace of celebrated Vekllei folk songwriter Tohs Viskaismesn (1847-1912).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bakur borough is home to some of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s most spectacular subarctic scenery, dominated lava slopes, ice fields, and fjords. Its position among the Westernmost boroughs in Vekllei makes it a great staging town for Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s expansive fishing fleet, including line and trawling vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint green&#34;&gt;
  ߷ This article is about a &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;borough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Eyri, the bones of an ancient beast warp and groan in the sun, red skin glinting in the whitecap churn of the shallows, oxidising, broken, ripped open by the sea.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-03-17-serpent/&#34;&gt;Killing a Sea Serpent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;fc&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;he borough of Eyri&lt;/strong&gt; is an administrative region on the far northwest coast of Vekllei, located in the Afouismeh Region north of &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/bakur&#34;&gt;Bakur&lt;/a&gt; and south of Basa. It is named after Eyri, an isolated coastal community employed mostly in controlled aquaculture by the Ocean Bureau. This quiet borough abounds with myth and legend related to its long seafaring history, emphasised only by the colossal wreck of the nearby icebreaking submarine &lt;em&gt;Sea Serpent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eyri was settled early in Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s history, as sagas describe several coastal settlements established across North Afouismeh around 1000BC, suggesting a founding date similar to its neighbouring boroughs. Eyri&amp;rsquo;s past is much more difficult to trace than its neighbours, however, as its cliffs have been significantly eroded and with them the earliest traces of settlement of the area. Like most towns of this period, Eyri relied heavily on fishing for food, and as existing fish stock was depleted near shore Eyri&amp;rsquo;s people had to venture further and further out into open water to fish. It is often suggested that Eyri is one of several northwestern coastal boroughs responsible for the extinction of the Grey-Fin Tuna in the 16th Century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For its small population of some 45,000 people, it has produced a remarkable number of famous artists, including naval painter Olivia Semesns (1863-1912) and frontman for &lt;em&gt;Ko Ko&lt;/em&gt; Sizi Danosson (2015-).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 2020s, Eyri saw tremendous investment by the Ocean Bureau into aquaculture infrastructure along its coast. Some 20% of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Atlantic Salmon stock are raised here, which is remarkable considering Eyri makes up only 0.18% of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s human population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eyri is known best for its cliffs, which watch over fjords and beaches pummelled by enormous Atlantic swells and icebergs. Along the coast the roar of the ocean can always be heard. Eyri is also known, somewhat unfortunately, for its miserable rain and cold weather, as most of its towns are situated between the &lt;em&gt;Osmo&lt;/em&gt; mountain ranges which funnel in cold arctic air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These are not particularly adventurous expeditions — most of her work is performed along old trails and paths, but Bea finds the sublime amidst the mundane and has contributed enormously to the ecological understanding of local flora in the borough of Holsyim, where she was born.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-12-08-bea/&#34;&gt;Bea and the Mosses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;fc&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;he borough of Holsyim&lt;/strong&gt; is an administrative region in the east of Vekllei, located north-east of Seisyo and south-west of Fyell. It is named after Holsyim, its largest population centre. The town of Holsyim borders the &lt;em&gt;Holsyim lo &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-12-05-gods/&#34;&gt;Kronaismioudelfia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (Holsyim Crown Land), an isolated natural and spiritual preserve home to some of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s oldest temperate rainforests. It is also a popular resort town, and receives many domestic tourists each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holsyim was founded as a fishing village in the late 19th century, but it&amp;rsquo;s likely that it was inhabited for many hundreds of years before that in smaller, undocumented settlements. The emergence of a new volcanic islet in 1942 was first reported by residents of the nearby village of Spisek, now known as Little Island. The town of Holsyim is home to an annual nude swim each winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holsyim is well known for its adjacency to the Holsyim Crown Land, a preserved area of temperate rainforest that hosts thousands of different species of plants, animals and mosses. As Crown Land, it remains undeveloped and officially unrecognised by the Vekllei government, but nonetheless is documented extensively by local ecologists. The town of Holsyim sits on Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Southern Coast, and has some of the largest beaches in the Vika Region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many townsfolk in Ou are employed in operation of the dam, either through the Thunder or Hydroburos. It is also the site of a small Vekllei National University laboratory which examines the dam environment and trains its staff.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Ou is considered the birthplace of demons in Upen mythology, who emerged from the Valley of the Dead to return humans to the spirit world. For this reason, Ou is considered a sacred borough in Vekllei and much of its territory remains untouchable &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/#administrative-divisions&#34;&gt;Crown Land&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint green&#34;&gt;
  ߷ This article is about a &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;borough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Royal Borough of Lita was not far from Copette, one of the Five Crown Boroughs of Vekllei, but this was Vekllei’s glacial interior and it felt a million miles from anywhere. Its geography was ancient and violent, strikingly barren and brutally volcanic. Why visit Europa? It was alien enough here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-01-5-rocket/&#34;&gt;A New Year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;fc&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;he borough of Lita&lt;/strong&gt; is an administrative region in the east of Vekllei, located in the Lava Region west of Copette and south-east of Krafla. It is named after Lita, its largest population centre and science town nestled in the glacial basins made by millions of years of freshwater runoff. It is well-known in Vekllei as the site of the Lita Cosmodrome, the primary launch site for industrial and scientific spacecraft. It is also the &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; headquarters of the &lt;em&gt;Cosmos Office&lt;/em&gt; (Cosmoburo), even if its operations remain &lt;em&gt;de jure&lt;/em&gt; centred in Vekllei Proper. The population of the town of Lita and its neighbouring villages is heavily affected by the Cosmodrome, transforming the borough into one of the primary astronomy and astrophysics hubs of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lita is relatively isolated from the coasts by its dramatic mountain ranges and glacial terrain, and remained uninhabited until the establishment of the Vekllei Missile Programme in the mid-20th Century. Lita first served as a closed government town supporting the Vekllei Rocketry Corps (today the &lt;em&gt;Rocket Navy of the Vekllei Commonwealth Armed Forces&lt;/em&gt;). Lita was occupied by the British military during occupation. Since independence, the town has opened and is served by multiple rail lines from the capital, including the &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/miyatvousi/&#34;&gt;Miyatvousi&lt;/a&gt; bullet train. The nearby town of Dismaisiyou remains restricted and is operated directly by the Cosmoburo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lita&amp;rsquo;s flat, glacial basins make good launch sites for rockets. The borough is located in the Lava lava fields and glacial highlands, and its high elevation and spectacular mountain ranges make a dramatic backdrop for its regular rocket launches.&lt;/p&gt;

  ߷ This article is about a &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;borough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Out in Voya Voya, the gardens light the people, and distill turbulent human temperament into momentary, sequential lyrical images. A dead leaf moving by miracle across still water; an overturned bucket collecting dew along its handle; fern leaves half-curled, young and growing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-03-27-rivers/&#34;&gt;City Rivers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;fc&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;he borough of Lo&lt;/strong&gt; is an administrative region in southwest Vekllei, located in the Capital Region south of Bouisgeh and west of &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/voya-voya&#34;&gt;Voya Voya&lt;/a&gt;. It covers the entire area of Voya Voya, a city of some 450,000 people in the capital&amp;rsquo;s extended metro area renowned for its parkland and green spaces. Voya Voya makes up part of the capital&amp;rsquo;s satellite belt of boroughs, characterised by green space and mixed-use residential planning. Voya Voya is often referred to as the capital&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;garden borough&amp;rdquo; for its density and quality of parkland and forest reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;etymology&#34;&gt;Etymology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voya Voya&lt;/strong&gt; is transliterated as &amp;ldquo;Good Good,&amp;rdquo; through in practice is better translated as &amp;ldquo;Good Place,&amp;rdquo; analogous to English towns like &amp;ldquo;Goodwood.&amp;rdquo; It refers to the natural temperate rainforests of its area, much of which are preserved in its parks and in its northern &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/#administrative-divisions&#34;&gt;Crown Land&lt;/a&gt;. It is only one of a handful of Vekllei cities to use &lt;em&gt;Topyas&lt;/em&gt; emphasis through repetition, which has more or less been superseded in modern Vekllei by &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/culture/language/#phonetic-reading&#34;&gt;duplicate consonants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s that smell? Smell it. It smells like the freshest thing I&amp;rsquo;ve ever smelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Tzipora Desmoisnes, after visiting Voya Voya for the first time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voya Voya&amp;rsquo;s area originally included several small villages founded in the early Middle Period, which by the 19th Century had developed into satellite suburbs of the industrious capital area. This expansion was encouraged by the Atlantic Junta from the mid-1850s through to the early 1930s, during which Voya Voya tripled in population. By the mid-20th Century, it had become apparent that the sprawling Capital metro area had become overextended, and threatened to link up further with boroughs in Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s interior, beyond the glaciers. A &amp;lsquo;green belt&amp;rsquo; programme was announced in 1956, and saw significant portions of Voya Voya and its nearby boroughs preserved as untouchable forests. During this period, Voya Voya was known mostly as a working-class satellite to the wealthier coastal boroughs of the capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Atomic War, the area&amp;rsquo;s permanent rainforest was protected from firestorms by the scorched impact craters in the neighbouring boroughs of Coyenstisn and Lava, and nearby Cusi Lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;postwar-development&#34;&gt;Postwar Development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atomic War collapsed the capital area, and dramatically reduced the population of Voya Voya&amp;rsquo;s neighbouring boroughs. Although the borough itself did not receive direct strikes, the subsequent fallout and social collapse saw starvation and emigration from the borough throughout occupation and into independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Floral Period, protections first developed by the Junta for Voya Voya&amp;rsquo;s green belt were extended by the Floral Government, including the establishment of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/#administrative-divisions&#34;&gt;Crown Land&lt;/a&gt; in its north and the clearing of rubble and replanting of rainforest throughout its inhabited interior. The architects of early independence reduced the density of the borough dramatically, clearing land for parks that now characterise the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2076, Voya Voya was named Borough of the Year by the Festival Commission, which saw it heavily reported by documentary films and tourism material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voya Voya is flat and low-lying, though its border extends to the dramatic hills of the southern Thanveler Glacier. It is cool and wet, and has large areas of temperate rainforest typical of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s southern coast. Rainforest flora are also found in the city of Voya Voya, where tree ferns grow in alleys and in roundabouts. The city itself is medium-rise, like much of the capital, but checkered into planned areas of habitation and parkland. Aqueducts carrying water from the Hydroburo collectors in Thanveler criss-cross its streets and parks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;crown-land&#34;&gt;Crown Land&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voya Voya&amp;rsquo;s Crown Land is an area of forbidden rainforest north of the city area, and was officially struck from Floral Government sovereignty in 2025. It remains a densely forested area belonging to the Land Sovereign, and has tremendous influence on both the culture and composition of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cusi-lake&#34;&gt;Cusi Lake&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cusi Lake is a natural body of water to Voya Voya&amp;rsquo;s southwest, which has doubled in size since the construction of the Cusi Hydroelectric Dam in 1965. Its area is split between the boroughs of Voya Voya, Lo, Coyenstisn, and Lava. As a controlled lake, it is popular for watercraft and swimming, though is extremely cold throughout the year due to runoff from distant glaciers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;infrastructure&#34;&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Voya Voya is best known for its parks, it is also highly accessible from the capital, linked by a variety of rail lines including bullet trains to the South Coast, Lonne and Thanveler. It is also the origin of the capital area&amp;rsquo;s aqueduct system, a network of open-air water bridges originating in southern Voya Voya, which were first built in the 19th Century and rebuilt in the 21st. Although tourist infrastructure is sparse, it remains a popular borough for day-trips from coastal hotels, a trip made trivial by the density of the capital&amp;rsquo;s rail network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-water-commission-aqueduct-pumpworks&#34;&gt;The Water Commission Aqueduct Pumpworks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Water Commission (Hydroburo) Pumpworks in Voya Voya supplies pressure for aqueducts in the city and its neighbouring boroughs. It pulls water from both Cusi Lake and open aqueducts from Thanveler, and pushes water through an elevated network of bridges across the area. After its elevation, water is pulled by gravity with pressure from water towers. The aqueduct system provides water for all parkland in Voya Voya. The Pumpworks is a large brick/Newda facility on Cusi Lake, and its pumps are powered by on-site geothermal steam wells, as they have for a century. Small railcars called Microsweeps run along the open-air aqueducts to clear blockages and sediment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;botanical-gardens-of-voya-voya&#34;&gt;Botanical Gardens of Voya Voya&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Voya Voya Botanical Gardens are a complex of green areas covering about 12 city blocks, housing mostly indigenous flora. While the Royal Botanical Gardens in Vekllei Proper feature international gardens sampling every continent on Earth, Voya Voya&amp;rsquo;s Gardens are managed as educational public spaces celebrating local landscapes and rainforest. Its facilities include a fair and parade ground, Newda parks, lakes and ponds, rainforests, and greenhouse infrastructure. The Botanical Gardens are the site of festivals in Voya Voya, and often celebrate live music and theatre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hydroburo-aqueduct-beautification-scheme&#34;&gt;Hydroburo Aqueduct Beautification Scheme&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In celebration of 50 years of independence, in 2065 the Hydroburo embarked on an ambitious public art project to celebrate the South Coast&amp;rsquo;s ancient aqueduct network. Coordinated from Voya Voya, the site of the Aqueduct Pumpworks, Voya Voya&amp;rsquo;s aqueducts were embossed with tiled murals over the course of about ten years, and were finally completed in March 2076. Its contruction employed nearly 1,500 artists and locals in its peak. Voya Voya&amp;rsquo;s aqueducts are widely recognised as some of the most beautiful pieces of civic infrastructure in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;all-smiles-ice-cream-factory&#34;&gt;All-Smiles Ice Cream Factory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-Smiles Ice Cream, the second-most consumed brand in Vekllei, are headquartered in Voya Voya. Its manufactory, A.S. Ice Cream S.p.M., is located in the heart of Voya Voya and is a popular local attraction, since it gives tours and samples to visitors on Sundays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gigayeh had beautiful empty beaches, littered with icebergs that caught the light like jewels, but Tzipora couldn’t swim and the water was freezing. They could have enjoyed café food in the sun, but Cobian’s regimented home life had left her incapable of eating outside of her designated meals, and Tzipora could only drink so much coffee. Instead, most of these afternoons, they found themselves sitting on the ocean promenade, watching a handful of locals go about their business as they counted the minutes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;fc&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;he borough of Mirah&lt;/strong&gt; is an administrative region on the west coast of Vekllei, located east of Tohs and south of Geame. It is named after Mirah, its largest population centre and fishing town dependent largely on deepwater trawling in the Vekllei Sea. It is also home to the Vekllei International Casino, a hotel and resort available only to foreigners, which resides in the town of Gigayeh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mirah is among several boroughs on Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s West Coast settled thousands of years ago by Aleutian peoples, and many residents of Mirah have family histories that trace back hundreds of years. In 1924, the Mirah Port opened to welcome fishing traffic returning from deep Atlantic waters and Greenland. In 2026, the International Casino opened in Gigayeh, to bolster tourism on the West Coast and relieve pressure on overburdened tourist facilities in the Capital Region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mirah is considered a satellite borough to the Capital Region, but formally lies in the Coastal Ro Highlands. It is abundant with seabirds, cold-weather mosses and drumlin fields. The famous white Siyaiousinesm Cliffs are also found nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

  ߷ This article is about a &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;borough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a so-called “flash plant” in Miyatvousi, in the Lava region of Vekllei [&amp;hellip;] the earth here is alive; in the cold, the ponds begin to steam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-05-24-hollywood/&#34;&gt;Gone Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;fc&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;he borough of Miyatvousi&lt;/strong&gt; is an administrative region in northern Vekllei, located in the Lava Region north of Groisniyah and southwest of &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/lita/&#34;&gt;Lita&lt;/a&gt;. Its area is highly volcanic and is home to several natural features, including the Gismavik Dome and the Miyatsimi Geyser Fields. The area outside of the city of Miyatvousi is sparsely populated and mostly claimed by flower-tundras and Crown Land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;etymology&#34;&gt;Etymology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miyatvousi&lt;/strong&gt; is an &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/culture/language/#history&#34;&gt;Old Vekllei&lt;/a&gt; combination of the words for &amp;ldquo;mineral&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;vision,&amp;rdquo; which in this case refer to indigenous mythos around still, mirror-like pools common to flower tundras in the area. Its name implies a connection between the physical landscape of the Miyatvousi area and the spirit world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All pools, under the dormant skin of the Earth, lead to other realms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Verse 112, &lt;em&gt;God Saga&lt;/em&gt;, 11th Century&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Miyatvousi has been recognised as a significant cultural site in Upen, the borough housed no major settlements until the formal incorporation of the town of Miyatvousi into the eastern dominion of the Atlantic Junta in the 17th Century. Previously, the land was inhabited by minor agricultural communities, most tending to livestock. Cultural artefacts found in the borough suggest human settlement may date back to the 10th Century, but by the end of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Middle Period the borough was regarded as an empty Spirit Land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Late Period, the town of Miyatvousi remained small and agricultural, and was considered an insignificant settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;postwar-development&#34;&gt;Postwar Development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after independence in the postwar period, Miyatvousi was surveyed by the Electric Company of Vekllei (now Magma-Electric Commission of Vekllei/Thunderburo) for its proximity to exploitable geothermal sites. In 2025, construction began on what is now the sprawling Miyatvousi Magma-Electric Power &amp;amp; Flash Plant, which began operation in 2029 and was expanded with several satellite wells and turbine plants in the the subsequent decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of Miyatvousi has since become a major so-called &amp;ldquo;Magma Town&amp;rdquo; with a growing population employed directly by the M.E.C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The town of Poka, in the south of the borough, was the setting of the popular &lt;em&gt;Six Rings&lt;/em&gt; film franchise, and is a minor domestic tourist attraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The borough is now a major contributor of lamb towards Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s food pool, and is home to several agricultural shows throughout its villages and townships each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miyatvousi is sparsely populated and highly volcanic, and the majority of its land-area is characterised by flower-tundras, geysers, steam pools and other geological phenomena. Its largest settlements are in the east of the borough, with its west dominated by the Miyatvouosi-Lavavik Crown Lands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miyatvousi&amp;rsquo;s Gismavik Dome is one of the largest dormant volcanoes in Vekllei, and is constantly monitored by the Volcanoes Bureau and Geological Survey for shifts in volcanic activity. The size of its magma pool is of serious concern, since an eruption would be catastrophic to the greater Miyatvousi/Groisniyah area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;miyatvousi-mirror-pools&#34;&gt;Miyatvousi Mirror-Pools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large coloured mineral pools are common to the flower-tundras, produced either by underground superheated springs or from runoff from geothermal power activity. The largest of these are popular local attractions, and are traditionally bathed in by locals for health or religious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;infrastructure&#34;&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miyatvousi is linked to the coast via the Vekllei Central Highland Bullet Train, which has contributed to its postwar presence as an arterial link to Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s North Coast. The borough is best known for its production of geothermal power and support facilities which contribute a majority amount of electricity to Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s East Coast Supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;miyatvousi-magma-electric-power--flash-plant&#34;&gt;Miyatvousi Magma-Electric Power &amp;amp; Flash Plant&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Miyatvousi Magma-Electric Power Plant (M.E.C.A.) is a sprawling complex of geothermal power facilities located west of the city of Miyatvousi. Expanded several times over its five-decades-long life, the facility now includes several distinct power plants, numbered 1 through 4. M.E.C.A. is a supercritical geothermal plant, and was the first of its kind in Vekllei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;miyatvousi-farm-co-operative-sp&#34;&gt;Miyatvousi Farm Co-operative S.P.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miyatvousi remains heavily agricultural, and most of the borough&amp;rsquo;s food export is monopolised through the Miyatvousi Farm Co-operative S.P. The organisation, designed as a village agricultural co-op, consolidates food products for larger food manufacturers along the coasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint green&#34;&gt;
  ߷ This article is about a &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;borough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The main beach in Mumen, the nicest of the seaside districts, is constructed out of sand imported from the dunes of Africa. Where the rest of the country has black sand, a symptom of its volcanic turbulence, Mumen has nice yellow sand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-11-09-beach/&#34;&gt;Like Father, Like Daughter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;fc&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;he borough of Mumen&lt;/strong&gt; is an administrative region on the southwest coast of Vekllei, located in the Capital Region south of Pharos and west of Little Vekllei. It is named after Mumen, the city neighbourhood to which it belongs. It is home to one of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s primary immigrant processing centres, and now hosts a thriving immigrant community populated mostly by Southern Europeans. It is best known for its touristy seaside and bright white beaches, which take advantage of Southwest Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s warm gulf climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although people have lived in Mumen since the earliest days of Vekllei settlement, the Borough of Mumen was incorporated in 1996 from two previously existing municipalities, called &lt;em&gt;Sizm&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Musma&lt;/em&gt;. When we talk about Mumen today, we usually talk about its vibrant immigrant fusion cultures, made up of Greeks, Croations, Italians and Spanish migrants that arrived throughout the late 20th Century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 1990s, Mumen was revitalised as part of a broader effort towards modernising Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s tourist infrastructure, much of which survived the atomic bombing. The borough&amp;rsquo;s signature white beaches, along with its seaside resorts and promenades, were constructed during this time. Although highly visited by foreign and domestic tourists alike, the city of Mumen is less travelled, and retains the dense migrant community districts of its prewar years. It has some of the best food in the Capital Region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The town is the birthplace of former Prime Minister Come Des Desvouisan (1982-2067).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Mumen is most famous for its beaches, this coastal borough been oceangoing long before tourists arrived. Close to both Pharos and positioned along Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s southern gulf ocean currents, it experiences warm summers and mild winters, though suffers sporadic rains in both spring and autumn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint green&#34;&gt;
  ߷ This article is about a &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;borough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many townsfolk in Ou are employed in operation of the dam, either through the Thunder or Hydroburos. It is also the site of a small Vekllei National University laboratory which examines the dam environment and trains its staff.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-04-21-hydro/&#34;&gt;The Ou Hydroburo Office&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;fc&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;he borough of Ou&lt;/strong&gt; is an administrative region in the central Ro Highlands of Vekllei, located southwest of Laisiyo and north of Kyala. It is named after Ou, a prominent agricultural town of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Middle Period that was transformed in the 20th Century into the cultural and military centre of the Ro Region. At nearly 1.2 million residents, Ou was narrowly excluded from becoming one of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s five Crown Boroughs in 2021, but remains the second-largest borough of the Ro Highlands, after Lonne. Its importance to &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/culture/religion/&#34;&gt;Upen&lt;/a&gt; leads most Upen-observing Vekllei people to regard Ou as a sacred borough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;etymology&#34;&gt;Etymology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ou&lt;/strong&gt; is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/culture/language/#history&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Topyas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pure &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/culture/language/#diphthongs&#34;&gt;Ocean Vowel&lt;/a&gt; meaning &amp;ldquo;spirit&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;personhood&amp;rdquo;, and in its written form is considered a core &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/culture/language/#4-rapotenne&#34;&gt;Rapotenne&lt;/a&gt; rune in &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/culture/religion/&#34;&gt;Upen&lt;/a&gt;. Ou is regarded as the birthplace of demons in Upen mythology, who emerged from the Valley of the Dead to return humans to the spirit world. For this reason, Ou is considered a sacred borough in Vekllei and much of its territory remains untouchable &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/#administrative-divisions&#34;&gt;Crown Land&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ou&lt;/strong&gt; was settled originally as a rest stop between the burgeoning trading town of Montre and the southern port city of Vekllei circa 1440, and by 1480 had developed into a &amp;ldquo;glorious township&amp;rdquo; subject to the sovereign monarch of Vekllei. Its settlement was originally plagued by crop failure, which was considered a curse for encroaching on the sacred land of the nearby Valley of the Dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1520, as a result of the ongoing food scarcity in the wake of the Junta&amp;rsquo;s rebellion, Ou suffered a famine that killed the majority of its population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 19th Century, Ou was incorporated into the Atlantic Junta&amp;rsquo;s electrification program, which incorporated the borough and its major towns into the Southern Vekllei power network. The town of Ou was a major staging point for network extensions northward, which would see Montre electrified in 1886.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The town is the birthplace of Yelsi Visma (1976-2063), who represented Vekllei in gymnastics at the 2000 Paris Olympics and was the recipient of the 2025 Vekllei Person of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;significance-in-upen&#34;&gt;Significance in Upen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Saga of Spirits&lt;/em&gt;, an undated oral myth dating at least to 150BC, describes the region around Ou as the birthplace of demons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[There were] sick mountains, falling to spirits, between Sko and Nuc [present-day Mt Scohe and the Adey Range], the spirit went there to die, and from the place he died emerged a creature of misfortune, blessed by Ku [god of death].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Verse 16, &lt;em&gt;Saga of Spirits&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demons in &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/culture/religion/&#34;&gt;Upen&lt;/a&gt; are creatures that emerge from the places spirits die, and access the human world through the resting places of souls (most commonly flower-tundras). The &lt;em&gt;Saga of Spirits&lt;/em&gt; suggests that demons were created accidentally by a selfish spirit and the death of a wicked man, and that Ku, the god of death, learned from this event how to entice their creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As demons remain an important aspect of Upen mythology, Ou&amp;rsquo;s Valley of the Dead (the place described in the passage above) is regarded as one of the most sacred sites in Vekllei. Its closest town, Tiamoin, is the site of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Festival of Rest, a spectacle designed to attract the attention of demons to allow human souls easy passage to the spirit world. Since the Valley of the Dead&amp;rsquo;s flower-tundra is considered especially close to the spirit world, many other rituals take place here, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-04-01-ego/&#34;&gt;sumoirnesdenen&lt;/a&gt; (ego-death) and communion with spirits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hydrotown-development&#34;&gt;Hydrotown Development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1912, Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s dwindling economic outlook and failing electrification programme led the governing Atlantic Junta to explore the establishment of hydroelectric dams, to put the unemployed to work and stabilise the southern power network. The construction of Ou&amp;rsquo;s first dam in 1916 marked the beginning of a broader hydroelectric initiative in the region, which had a radical effect on the cultural makeup of the borough. Two of Ou&amp;rsquo;s major towns, Ada and Tiamoin, were first founded as &amp;ldquo;hydro towns&amp;rdquo; by migrant Chinese labourers employed by the Hydro-Electric Commission (HEC), which to this day represent major centres of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Chinese population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After major construction by the HEC ceased in the early 1930s, Ou&amp;rsquo;s towns continued to support the hydro infrastructure and power plants that supplied electricity to Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s north coast in Afouismeh and Lava.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;postwar-redevelopment&#34;&gt;Postwar Redevelopment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after independence in 2015, Ou was ranked by the Vekllei War Recovery Bureau as a borough of &amp;ldquo;critical need&amp;rdquo;. Its preexisting status as a Hydro Borough prompted research towards the expansion of the newly-formed Hydroburo&amp;rsquo;s presence in the area, looking to replicate the prewar success of the borough&amp;rsquo;s original hydroelectric initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, new construction began on the Ou Hydroburo Office, a pumping and power plant complex designed to establish a postwar Hydroburo presence in the borough and supply fresh water to communities in the Ro Region. The construction accompanied a housing revitalisation effort towards the city of Ou and its nearby towns, building new apartments and parks to facilitate immigration from Southern Europe after the Atomic War.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Floral Period in Ou, much like the rest of the country, was marked by widespread immigration and population growth, which saw the city of Ou double in size between 2015 and 2046.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ou lies in the heart of the central Ro Highlands, a region dominated by dramatic mountain ranges, minor volcanoes, and flat highlands flower-tundras central to the Vekllei physical identity. Ou is known especially for the density and beauty of its flower-tundras, making it a popular tourist region and pilgrimage destination for Vekllei people. All of Ou&amp;rsquo;s major towns are shielded by its surrounding mountains, keeping weather mild and clear throughout the year. Ou also receives good sun, and is considerably warmer than its southwestern neighbours. It is also home to Stelavik and Cosmivik, two active volcanoes that erupt periodically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;valley-of-the-dead&#34;&gt;Valley of the Dead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Valley of the Dead is a sheltered flower-tundra between the Scohe and Adey mountain ranges of great spiritual importance to Upen. It is one of the largest such tundra in Ou, covering nearly 2000 acres west of Tiamoin. As Crown Land, it is completely bare of infrastructure or permanent human presence and requires an hour&amp;rsquo;s walk from the nearest station to access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;infrastructure&#34;&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to its spiritual significance, Ou is best known as a hub for both the Hydroburo and Thunderburo in the Ro Highlands. Several geothermal and hydroelectric power stations operate in the area, in addition to small nuclear facilities, water-treatment plants and water storage facilities designed to supply the region with fresh glacial water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;geothermal-power&#34;&gt;Geothermal Power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ada Geothermal Power Station was built in the Magma-Electric Commission&amp;rsquo;s northern plans in 2047 to support the expansion of grid-independent military presence in Ou. The station provides power for the Ada Rocketry Base and Test Sites, with surplus power directed towards the local towns and city of Ou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hydroburo-development&#34;&gt;Hydroburo Development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ou Dam, the borough&amp;rsquo;s first and oldest hydroelectric dam, was constructed in 1916 and has remained in continuous operation for over 150 years, with major renovations in 1982 and 2046. Since the Atomic War, the Hydro-Electric Commission has expanded its facilities in the area to include further dams and power generation capacity, and water supply for Ou and its neighbouring boroughs. Power generation in Ou provides for 6% of the country&amp;rsquo;s total commercial power use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ada-rocketry-base&#34;&gt;Ada Rocketry Base&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ada is the site of the Central Rocketry Base, a network of facilities that belong to the &lt;em&gt;Rocket Navy of the Vekllei Commonwealth Armed Forces&lt;/em&gt;. The Ada Rocketry Base resembles a closed town, since secret research work is performed at its laboratories and test sites. Although the sprawling complex does manufacture test rockets, they are not fired or &amp;ldquo;live-tested&amp;rdquo; in Ou because of its adjacency to important cultural sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint green&#34;&gt;
  ߷ This article is about a &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;borough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shattered fjords make up the north of Vekllei, particularly in boroughs like Santes, which are well-regarded for their striking cliffs and sloping igneous fingers, which evidence Vekllei’s ongoing volcanism. Offshore, hundreds of islets rise and sink over the centuries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-05-06-shrine-minded/&#34;&gt;Shrine-Minded Girls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;fc&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;he borough of Santes&lt;/strong&gt; is an administrative region in northern Vekllei, located in the Lava Region west of Moma and east of Hoaedesnen. Its area includes several isolated and sparsely-populated towns along Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s northern coast, particularly along the Grimsy and Mus Mus Fjords. The city of Santes is well-served by Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s rail network, but the majority of its coastal and inland towns are somewhat difficult to reach. Because of this, Santes is considered a minor borough and makes up part of the economically-depressed &lt;em&gt;North Senrouive Belt&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;etymology&#34;&gt;Etymology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Santes&lt;/strong&gt; is the Vekllei word for &amp;ldquo;saint,&amp;rdquo; and dates back to the Christianisation of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Middle Period sometime prior to the 16th Century. Its earliest appearance was traced to the Santesoavis chapel (lit. All Saints) near the city of Santes, built sometime in the 15th Century by Danish settlers, to which the parish and eventual borough owes its name. Outside of Christian contexts, Santes in Vekllei can also refer to noble spirits, the communicative spirits of &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/culture/religion/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Upen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know what happens when God meets a spirit? Do you have any idea? It is a place of blessings. It&amp;rsquo;s huge! We &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to find this shrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/characters/#tzipora-zelda-desmoisnes&#34;&gt;Tzipora Desmoisnes&lt;/a&gt;, convinced of hidden shrines in Santes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s northern coast was settled predominantly by Scandinavian settlers, who were displaced from Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s south in the centuries prior to the 15th Century. For this reason, the cultural and religious segregation of the north coasts produced unusual settlements unique from both southern Vekllei culture and Scandinavia. Settlements in present-day Santes and Moma were heavily christianised, but upon Upen&amp;rsquo;s reformation by King Desimou IV these populations were forcefully integrated into Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s feudal hierarchy and were ethnically displaced by Algic Vekllei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, Santes would remain culturally isolated from Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s powerful southern metropole, and remained somewhat politically independent until the late Junta years. By the early 19th Century, a road was established between Montre and the city of Santes, followed by a direct rail line in 1922. By this time, the Junta had consolidated control over all settlements in the Home Islands, and Santes was subsidised heavily by political centres in Montre and Vekllei Proper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;postwar-development&#34;&gt;Postwar Development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately after the war, Santes succumbed to a minor famine that killed nearly a tenth of its population. The borough was largely neglected until independence from British occupation in 2015, when the Interim Administration took control of the Home Islands. It was linked to the VNR Coastal Bullet Train Network in 2044.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santes&amp;rsquo;s historical isolation from Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s coastal regions has left many of its fjords undeveloped, which have become minor tourist attractions. Today, the borough is best known for its natural features, and as the origin of &lt;em&gt;Fisk Ferva&lt;/em&gt;, or Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s modern raw fish cuisine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a northern coastal borough, Santes sees wet summers and cold winters. Icebergs routinely wash ashore along its coast throughout the year, pulled south from the arctic by the Vekllei Gulf Stream. The borough itself is marked by cliffs and steep fjords, and most of its large settlements are some 100-200 meters above sea level. It is extremely lush, and features some of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s most visible and saturated coastal temperate rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;coastal-fjords&#34;&gt;Coastal Fjords&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santes&amp;rsquo;s glacial fjords appear as dramatic fingers of igneous rock, puncturing its coast with thousands of deep-water inlets. Since the borough is still dominated by aquaculture and minor agriculture, small villages are often found at the base of these inlets. This dramatic landscape and coastal treelessness is described in old Upen sagas, which contribute to the borough&amp;rsquo;s interest among pilgrims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;inlet-biosecurity-zone&#34;&gt;Inlet Biosecurity Zone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most inlets in Santes are protected by the Inlet Biosecurity Zone of Santes, a national legal protection that seeks to maintain the populations of open-water fish that live in them. Under these laws, only residents of Santes are permitted to fish among its fjords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;santes-rainforest&#34;&gt;Santes Rainforest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santes has several crown land rainforested regions, which prohibit sovereign visitation. Since the harsh weather of the coasts has depopulated most of the fjords of trees, these rainforests are mostly found around the city of Santes and further into its interior. The largest of them is the Mus Mus Crown Land, which includes nearly six thousand acres of rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;infrastructure&#34;&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santes is considered a minor borough and is not home to much venrouive/bureau proper activity. Most factories are consolidated in the city of Santes, which mostly produce fish products and metal components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;santes-magma-electric-power-plant&#34;&gt;Santes Magma-Electric Power Plant&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Santes Magma-Electric Power Plant is a facility operated by the Magma-Electric Commission of the Thunderburo. Its massive steam bores supply most of the power to Santes and Moma, and the waste water of this process is pumped into the Santes Mineral Lagoons, an open-air mineral spa open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;north-vekllei-tourism-council&#34;&gt;North Vekllei Tourism Council&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The North Vekllei Tourism Council, a direct branch of the Vekllei Tourism Bureau, is headquartered in the city of Santes for its proximity to Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s world-recognised fjords and bullet train rail access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Royal Borough of Lita was not far from Copette ( map of Vekllei here), one of the Five Crown Boroughs of Vekllei, but this was Vekllei’s glacial interior and it felt a million miles from anywhere. Its geography was ancient and violent, strikingly barren and brutally volcanic. Why visit Europa? It was alien enough here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shattered fjords make up the north of Vekllei, particularly in boroughs like Santes, which are well-regarded for their striking cliffs and sloping igneous fingers, which evidence Vekllei’s ongoing volcanism. Offshore, hundreds of islets rise and sink over the centuries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-05-06-shrine-minded/&#34;&gt;Shrine-Minded Girls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;fc&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;he borough of Santes&lt;/strong&gt; is an administrative region in northern Vekllei, located in the Lava Region west of Moma and east of Hoaedesnen. Its area includes several isolated and sparsely-populated towns along Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s northern coast, particularly along the Grimsy and Mus Mus Fjords. The city of Santes is well-served by Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s rail network, but the majority of its coastal and inland towns are somewhat difficult to reach. Because of this, Santes is considered a minor borough and makes up part of the economically-depressed &lt;em&gt;North Senrouive Belt&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;etymology&#34;&gt;Etymology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Santes&lt;/strong&gt; is the Vekllei word for &amp;ldquo;saint,&amp;rdquo; and dates back to the Christianisation of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Middle Period sometime prior to the 16th Century. Its earliest appearance was traced to the Santesoavis chapel (lit. All Saints) near the city of Santes, built sometime in the 15th Century by Danish settlers, to which the parish and eventual borough owes its name. Outside of Christian contexts, Santes in Vekllei can also refer to noble spirits, the communicative spirits of &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/culture/religion/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Upen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know what happens when God meets a spirit? Do you have any idea? It is a place of blessings. It&amp;rsquo;s huge! We &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to find this shrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/characters/#tzipora-zelda-desmoisnes&#34;&gt;Tzipora Desmoisnes&lt;/a&gt;, convinced of hidden shrines in Santes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s northern coast was settled predominantly by Scandinavian settlers, who were displaced from Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s south in the centuries prior to the 15th Century. For this reason, the cultural and religious segregation of the north coasts produced unusual settlements unique from both southern Vekllei culture and Scandinavia. Settlements in present-day Santes and Moma were heavily christianised, but upon Upen&amp;rsquo;s reformation by King Desimou IV these populations were forcefully integrated into Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s feudal hierarchy and were ethnically displaced by Algic Vekllei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, Santes would remain culturally isolated from Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s powerful southern metropole, and remained somewhat politically independent until the late Junta years. By the early 19th Century, a road was established between Montre and the city of Santes, followed by a direct rail line in 1922. By this time, the Junta had consolidated control over all settlements in the Home Islands, and Santes was subsidised heavily by political centres in Montre and Vekllei Proper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;postwar-development&#34;&gt;Postwar Development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately after the war, Santes succumbed to a minor famine that killed nearly a tenth of its population. The borough was largely neglected until independence from British occupation in 2015, when the Interim Administration took control of the Home Islands. It was linked to the VNR Coastal Bullet Train Network in 2044.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santes&amp;rsquo;s historical isolation from Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s coastal regions has left many of its fjords undeveloped, which have become minor tourist attractions. Today, the borough is best known for its natural features, and as the origin of &lt;em&gt;Fisk Ferva&lt;/em&gt;, or Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s modern raw fish cuisine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a northern coastal borough, Santes sees wet summers and cold winters. Icebergs routinely wash ashore along its coast throughout the year, pulled south from the arctic by the Vekllei Gulf Stream. The borough itself is marked by cliffs and steep fjords, and most of its large settlements are some 100-200 meters above sea level. It is extremely lush, and features some of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s most visible and saturated coastal temperate rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;coastal-fjords&#34;&gt;Coastal Fjords&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santes&amp;rsquo;s glacial fjords appear as dramatic fingers of igneous rock, puncturing its coast with thousands of deep-water inlets. Since the borough is still dominated by aquaculture and minor agriculture, small villages are often found at the base of these inlets. This dramatic landscape and coastal treelessness is described in old Upen sagas, which contribute to the borough&amp;rsquo;s interest among pilgrims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;inlet-biosecurity-zone&#34;&gt;Inlet Biosecurity Zone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most inlets in Santes are protected by the Inlet Biosecurity Zone of Santes, a national legal protection that seeks to maintain the populations of open-water fish that live in them. Under these laws, only residents of Santes are permitted to fish among its fjords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;santes-rainforest&#34;&gt;Santes Rainforest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santes has several crown land rainforested regions, which prohibit sovereign visitation. Since the harsh weather of the coasts has depopulated most of the fjords of trees, these rainforests are mostly found around the city of Santes and further into its interior. The largest of them is the Mus Mus Crown Land, which includes nearly six thousand acres of rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;

  ߷ This article is about a &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;borough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a so-called “flash plant” in Miyatvousi, in the Lava region of Vekllei [&amp;hellip;] the earth here is alive; in the cold, the ponds begin to steam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-05-24-hollywood/&#34;&gt;Gone Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;fc&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;he borough of Miyatvousi&lt;/strong&gt; is an administrative region in northern Vekllei, located in the Lava Region north of Groisniyah and southwest of &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/lita/&#34;&gt;Lita&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DO SOME SHIT ABOUT SUNSTONES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;etymology&#34;&gt;Etymology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miyatvousi&lt;/strong&gt; is an &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/culture/language/#history&#34;&gt;Old Vekllei&lt;/a&gt; combination of the words for &amp;ldquo;mineral&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;vision,&amp;rdquo; which in this case refer to indigenous mythos around still, mirror-like pools common to flower tundras in the area. Its name implies a connection between the physical landscape of the Miyatvousi area and the spirit world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All pools, under the dormant skin of the Earth, lead to other realms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Verse 112, &lt;em&gt;God Saga&lt;/em&gt;, 11th Century&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Miyatvousi has been recognised as a significant cultural site in Upen, the borough housed no major settlements until the formal incorporation of the town of Miyatvousi into the eastern dominion of the Atlantic Junta in the 17th Century. Previously, the land was inhabited by minor agricultural communities, most tending to livestock. Cultural artefacts found in the borough suggest human settlement may date back to the 10th Century, but by the end of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Middle Period the borough was regarded as an empty Spirit Land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Late Period, the town of Miyatvousi remained small and agricultural, and was considered an insignificant settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;postwar-development&#34;&gt;Postwar Development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after independence in the postwar period, Miyatvousi was surveyed by the Electric Company of Vekllei (now Magma-Electric Commission of Vekllei/Thunderburo) for its proximity to exploitable geothermal sites. In 2025, construction began on what is now the sprawling Miyatvousi Magma-Electric Power &amp;amp; Flash Plant, which began operation in 2029 and was expanded with several satellite wells and turbine plants in the the subsequent decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of Miyatvousi has since become a major so-called &amp;ldquo;Magma Town&amp;rdquo; with a growing population employed directly by the M.E.C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The town of Poka, in the south of the borough, was the setting of the popular &lt;em&gt;Six Rings&lt;/em&gt; film franchise, and is a minor domestic tourist attraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The borough is now a major contributor of lamb towards Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s food pool, and is home to several agricultural shows throughout its villages and townships each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miyatvousi is sparsely populated and highly volcanic, and the majority of its land-area is characterised by flower-tundras, geysers, steam pools and other geological phenomena. Its largest settlements are in the east of the borough, with its west dominated by the Miyatvouosi-Lavavik Crown Lands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miyatvousi&amp;rsquo;s Gismavik Dome is one of the largest dormant volcanoes in Vekllei, and is constantly monitored by the Volcanoes Bureau and Geological Survey for shifts in volcanic activity. The size of its magma pool is of serious concern, since an eruption would be catastrophic the greater Miyatvousi/Groisniyah area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;totoyan-sunstone-crown-lands&#34;&gt;Totoyan Sunstone Crown Lands&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large coloured mineral pools are common to the flower-tundras, produced either by underground superheated springs or from runoff from geothermal power activity. The largest of these are popular local attractions, and are traditionally bathed in by locals for health or religious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;infrastructure&#34;&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miyatvousi is linked to the coast via the Vekllei Central Highland Bullet Train, which has contributed to its postwar presence as an arterial link to Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s North Coast. The borough is best known for its production of geothermal power and support facilities which contribute a majority amount of electricity to Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s East Coast Supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The human royals may be long dead, but Vekllei’s flowering petticoat society retains a monarch — the literal physical presence of the land.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;fc&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;he borough of Troll&lt;/strong&gt; is an administrative region in southwest Vekllei, located in the Lava Region directly north of the glacier of Vatnayoskusl. Situated on the sloping north face of the Vekllei Glacier Highlands, the borough is home to several outlet glaciers flowing out of Vatnayoskusl&amp;rsquo;s ice cap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troll is sparsely-populated, and only includes the minor town of Troll and several smaller informal settlements. It is also highly volcanic, and home to the Houismey volcano and dozens of hotspots and mineral springs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;etymology&#34;&gt;Etymology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trolls&lt;/strong&gt; are human-sized creatures with rough grey skin and black eyes described by Vekllei sagas. They live in mountains and glaciers, where they hide in caves. If they are caught in daylight, they turn to stone. According to the sagas, the bodies of trolls eventually became the drumlins that litter Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s mossy plains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per the legends of the sagas, the borough of Troll was the site of a troll city, which was destroyed by lava spirits. This fact contributed to its naming upon its incorporation in the early 19th Century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I&amp;rsquo;ve met a troll. It was one of the nicest creatures I&amp;rsquo;ve ever met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/characters/#tzipora-zelda-desmoisnes&#34;&gt;Tzipora Desmoisnes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Troll has a signicant cultural history within Vekllei, it is a relatively recent borough. The town of Troll received a trading license in 1823, which is considered its founding as a borough. Little is recorded about its settlement prior to its incorporation, but it is known that nomadic Algic Vekllei had remained in the area for hundreds, if not thousands of years prior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although an important cultural site in &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/culture/religion&#34;&gt;Upen&lt;/a&gt;, the area around Troll is highly volcanic and spiritually complicated, and its status as isolated, resource-poor land prevented permanent settlement for most of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;postwar-development&#34;&gt;Postwar Development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troll has overall shrunk in population since the war, when many of its able-bodied adults moved to the urban coasts in search of employment. Since the late 2050s, the borough has seen a minor revitalisation after the establishment of the Vekllei Highlands Bullet Train, which links it to the larger boroughs on the coast. The economic changes under floral society have also benefited rural boroughs like Troll, since industry is less dependent on proximity to business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2036, a major eruption from the Houismeyvik volcano disrupted air travel in Vekllei and Western Europe for eighteen days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troll is situated in the heart of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s volcanic highlands, surrounded by minor glaciers and meltwater rivers. It is an extraordinarily pretty borough, and is a place of dramatic hues that shift with the landscape. From its main population centre, the town of Troll, the Vatnayoskusl Glacier is visible. Its water is some of the cleanest in the world, and highly prized overseas as a health tonic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;houismey-volcano&#34;&gt;Houismey Volcano&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Houismey Volcano, called Houismeyvik in Vekllei, is a basaltic volcano located to the north-west of an outlet glacier called Vosmaspesteh. It is a subglacial volcano situated underneath the surface, and the intersection of magma and meltwater causes phreatomagmatic explosions that can trigger eruptions. It is one of the most active volcanoes in Vekllei, though the size of its eruptions remain small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;troll-national-park&#34;&gt;Troll National Park&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Troll National Park is one of seventy-two national parks in Vekllei. As a National Park, rather than a Crown Land, it is designed for human visitation and operated by Parks of Vekllei. It is located in the southwest of the borough, and its facilities include boardwalks, rest stops, and hiking trails. It is also the end point of the Vatnayoskusl Track, an extreme hiking trail that crosses the glacier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;troll-lava-fields&#34;&gt;Troll Lava Fields&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Troll Lava Fields are a series of flat extinguished lava flows, which are the site of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s last troll city. They can be found north of Houismeyvik, and are part of the Troll Crown Land and Troll National Park. Although they are well-known within Vekllei, they are considered a site desecrated by the spirits and most visitors to the area are from overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;infrastructure&#34;&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troll is a minor borough that is mostly resource-poor. Its major contribution to the coasts is its abundance of clean fresh water that flows out of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s largest glacier, Vatnayoskusl. Although little of the glacier itself is located in Troll, most of its rivers and outlet glaciers flow through the borough, and so Troll&amp;rsquo;s largest industries are supported by the Hydroburo&amp;rsquo;s vested concerns in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;troll-high-speed-rail-depot&#34;&gt;Troll High-Speed Rail Depot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a midpoint of the Vekllei Highlands Bullet Train, an auxiliary bullet train depot and maintenance yard was established in the town of Troll. As the final developed borough before the expansive Vatnayoskusl Glacier, the maintenance yard is situated well to repair trains damaged by ice and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vekllei-geological-survey-station&#34;&gt;Vekllei Geological Survey Station&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Volcanoes Bureau and Geological Survey monitor volcanic activity in Vekllei, and have several minor research outposts established outside of and within Troll&amp;rsquo;s glacial territory. The borough&amp;rsquo;s vicinity to the Houismey volcano is of particular interest, and contributes to Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s ongoing research into seismic activity in Vekllei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;troll-water-treatment-plant&#34;&gt;Troll Water Treatment Plant&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troll&amp;rsquo;s location at the base of the Vatnayoskusl Glacier makes it a strategic site for the processing of freshwater runoff, which feeds Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s residential water systems. In 2066, the Troll Water Treatment Plant was established to support ageing plants in &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/voya-voya/&#34;&gt;Voya Voya&lt;/a&gt; and Guisimaya. The Troll Water Treatment Plant is operated by the Water Commission of Vekllei (Hydroburo).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint green&#34;&gt;
  ߷ This article is about a &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;borough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Out in Voya Voya, the gardens light the people, and distill human temperament into momentary, sequential lyrical images. A dead leaf moving by miracle across still water; an overturned bucket collecting dew along its handle; fern leaves half-curled, young and growing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-03-27-rivers/&#34;&gt;City Rivers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;fc&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;he borough of Voya Voya&lt;/strong&gt; is an administrative region in southwest Vekllei, located in the Capital Region north of Coyenstisn and east of Lo. It covers the entire area of Voya Voya, a city of some 450,000 people in the capital&amp;rsquo;s extended metro area renowned for its parkland and green spaces. Voya Voya makes up part of the capital&amp;rsquo;s satellite belt of boroughs, characterised by green space and mixed-use residential planning. Voya Voya is often referred to as the capital&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;garden borough&amp;rdquo; for its density and quality of parkland and forest reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;etymology&#34;&gt;Etymology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voya Voya&lt;/strong&gt; is transliterated as &amp;ldquo;Good Good,&amp;rdquo; through in practice is better translated as &amp;ldquo;Good Place,&amp;rdquo; analogous to English towns like &amp;ldquo;Goodwood.&amp;rdquo; It refers to the natural temperate rainforests of its area, much of which are preserved in its parks and in its northern &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/#administrative-divisions&#34;&gt;Crown Land&lt;/a&gt;. It is only one of a handful of Vekllei cities to use &lt;em&gt;Topyas&lt;/em&gt; emphasis through repetition, which has more or less been superseded in modern Vekllei by &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/culture/language/#phonetic-reading&#34;&gt;duplicate consonants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s that smell? Smell it. It smells like the freshest thing I&amp;rsquo;ve ever smelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Tzipora Desmoisnes, after visiting Voya Voya for the first time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voya Voya&amp;rsquo;s area originally included several small villages founded in the early Middle Period, which by the 19th Century had developed into satellite suburbs of the industrious capital area. This expansion was encouraged by the Atlantic Junta from the mid-1850s through to the early 1930s, during which Voya Voya tripled in population. By the mid-20th Century, it had become apparent that the sprawling Capital metro area had become overextended, and threatened to link up further with boroughs in Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s interior, beyond the glaciers. A &amp;lsquo;green belt&amp;rsquo; programme was announced in 1956, and saw significant portions of Voya Voya and its nearby boroughs preserved as untouchable forests. During this period, Voya Voya was known mostly as a working-class satellite to the wealthier coastal boroughs of the capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Atomic War, the area&amp;rsquo;s permanent rainforest was protected from firestorms by the scorched impact craters in the neighbouring boroughs of Coyenstisn and Lava, and nearby Cusi Lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;postwar-development&#34;&gt;Postwar Development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atomic War collapsed the capital area, and dramatically reduced the population of Voya Voya&amp;rsquo;s neighbouring boroughs. Although the borough itself did not receive direct strikes, the subsequent fallout and social collapse saw starvation and emigration from the borough throughout occupation and into independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Floral Period, protections first developed by the Junta for Voya Voya&amp;rsquo;s green belt were extended by the Floral Government, including the establishment of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/#administrative-divisions&#34;&gt;Crown Land&lt;/a&gt; in its north and the clearing of rubble and replanting of rainforest throughout its inhabited interior. The architects of early independence reduced the density of the borough dramatically, clearing land for parks that now characterise the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2076, Voya Voya was named Borough of the Year by the Festival Commission, which saw it heavily reported by documentary films and tourism material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voya Voya is flat and low-lying, though its border extends to the dramatic hills of the southern Thanveler Glacier. It is cool and wet, and has large areas of temperate rainforest typical of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s southern coast. Rainforest flora are also found in the city of Voya Voya, where tree ferns grow in alleys and in roundabouts. The city itself is medium-rise, like much of the capital, but checkered into planned areas of habitation and parkland. Aqueducts carrying water from the Hydroburo collectors in Thanveler criss-cross its streets and parks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;crown-land&#34;&gt;Crown Land&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voya Voya&amp;rsquo;s Crown Land is an area of forbidden rainforest north of the city area, and was officially struck from Floral Government sovereignty in 2025. It remains a densely forested area belonging to the Land Sovereign, and has tremendous influence on both the culture and composition of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cusi-lake&#34;&gt;Cusi Lake&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cusi Lake is a natural body of water to Voya Voya&amp;rsquo;s southwest, which has doubled in size since the construction of the Cusi Hydroelectric Dam in 1965. Its area is split between the boroughs of Voya Voya, Lo, Coyenstisn, and Lava. As a controlled lake, it is popular for watercraft and swimming, though is extremely cold throughout the year due to runoff from distant glaciers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;infrastructure&#34;&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Voya Voya is best known for its parks, it is also highly accessible from the capital, linked by a variety of rail lines including bullet trains to the South Coast, Lonne and Thanveler. It is also the origin of the capital area&amp;rsquo;s aqueduct system, a network of open-air water bridges originating in southern Voya Voya, which were first built in the 19th Century and rebuilt in the 21st. Although tourist infrastructure is sparse, it remains a popular borough for day-trips from coastal hotels, a trip made trivial by the density of the capital&amp;rsquo;s rail network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-water-commission-aqueduct-pumpworks&#34;&gt;The Water Commission Aqueduct Pumpworks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Water Commission (Hydroburo) Pumpworks in Voya Voya supplies pressure for aqueducts in the city and its neighbouring boroughs. It pulls water from both Cusi Lake and open aqueducts from Thanveler, and pushes water through an elevated network of bridges across the area. After its elevation, water is pulled by gravity with pressure from water towers. The aqueduct system provides water for all parkland in Voya Voya. The Pumpworks is a large brick/Newda facility on Cusi Lake, and its pumps are powered by on-site geothermal steam wells, as they have for a century. Small railcars called Microsweeps run along the open-air aqueducts to clear blockages and sediment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;botanical-gardens-of-voya-voya&#34;&gt;Botanical Gardens of Voya Voya&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Voya Voya Botanical Gardens are a complex of green areas covering about 12 city blocks, housing mostly indigenous flora. While the Royal Botanical Gardens in Vekllei Proper feature international gardens sampling every continent on Earth, Voya Voya&amp;rsquo;s Gardens are managed as educational public spaces celebrating local landscapes and rainforest. Its facilities include a fair and parade ground, Newda parks, lakes and ponds, rainforests, and greenhouse infrastructure. The Botanical Gardens are the site of festivals in Voya Voya, and often celebrate live music and theatre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hydroburo-aqueduct-beautification-scheme&#34;&gt;Hydroburo Aqueduct Beautification Scheme&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In celebration of 50 years of independence, in 2065 the Hydroburo embarked on an ambitious public art project to celebrate the South Coast&amp;rsquo;s ancient aqueduct network. Coordinated from Voya Voya, the site of the Aqueduct Pumpworks, Voya Voya&amp;rsquo;s aqueducts were embossed with tiled murals over the course of about ten years, and were finally completed in March 2076. Its contruction employed nearly 1,500 artists and locals in its peak. Voya Voya&amp;rsquo;s aqueducts are widely recognised as some of the most beautiful pieces of civic infrastructure in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;all-smiles-ice-cream-factory&#34;&gt;All-Smiles Ice Cream Factory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-Smiles Ice Cream, the second-most consumed brand in Vekllei, are headquartered in Voya Voya. Its manufactory, A.S. Ice Cream S.p.M., is located in the heart of Voya Voya and is a popular local attraction, since it gives tours and samples to visitors on Sundays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint green&#34;&gt;
  ߷ This article is about a &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;borough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She never claimed to be like the boys at Yana, because she wasn’t. But she knew what it was like to enter domesticity and never feel at home in it. She was lucky; she had Baron. She wondered about those boys who married before they left. She wondered where those brides were now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-04-05-lakehouse/&#34;&gt;Ghosts of Taiwan in the Yana Lakehouse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;fc&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;he borough of Yana&lt;/strong&gt; is an administrative region in central Vekllei, located in the far-western Lava region north of Tiyousn and east of Laisiyo. It is named after Yana, a city of some 45,000 people isolated along Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s sparse, moonlike volcanic interior for which the Lava region is named. Yana makes up part of an agro-belt of depopulated boroughs that sit along the Sesmiousvianneh river, which washes rich igneous minerals north to towns downstream. The town of Yana is best known for its proximity to the spectacular molten lava fields common in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;etymology&#34;&gt;Etymology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yana&lt;/strong&gt; was the name of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s first spirit ambassador in &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/culture/religion/&#34;&gt;Upen&lt;/a&gt; mythology, who met human farmer Armond Volusksson at the base of &lt;em&gt;Mose&lt;/em&gt;, a volcano associated with lava spirits. Although the meeting (as described in the &lt;em&gt;Molten Wind&lt;/em&gt; sagas) took place in the present-day borough of Askayaisn, it remains a common Blood Name in the country and was chosen for Yana&amp;rsquo;s settlement to protect it against seismic activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yana is very beautiful, yes. It&amp;rsquo;s a very serious place, in the sense that you can feel the volatility of things around you. Out on the coasts, growing up is very different. The weather is better and the cities are bigger; there&amp;rsquo;s more to do. In Yana, it was quite a serious place to grow up, you see. You are in better contact with the Earth &amp;ndash; not in some abstract sense, but in a very real fear of what it might produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Ayn Rumouisen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yana has been inhabited since the 17th Century or so, dated mostly to the erection of the town of Yana&amp;rsquo;s community hall in 1644. Like many of its neighbouring boroughs, its initial settlement was spurred by an interest in its mineral-rich volcanic soil, which offered good growing for staple Vekllei foods like wheat and potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1856, the Beri Railroad Bridge was constructed across Sesmiousvianneh river, which allowed for easy export to Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s wealthy coastal communities. The structure operated for nearly a hundred years, until the wooden bridge was washed away in 1948 by heavy rains, taking Locomotive No. 6004 and its engineers with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2006-flood-disaster&#34;&gt;2006 Flood Disaster&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2006, heavy rains over the &lt;em&gt;Skusme&lt;/em&gt; glacier caused the Sesmiousvianneh river to swell over its banks and flood the town of Beri, washing away several homes and a mill. Nearly 150 people died as their homes were swept away, making it the largest flooding disaster in recent Vekllei memory, and is remembered each year across all towns of the borough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;postwar-development&#34;&gt;Postwar Development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Floral Period, Yana was marked by the Vekllei Beautification Bureau as a successful example of &amp;ldquo;traditional Lava [region] community living and culture,&amp;rdquo; and suggested using it as a blueprint for further development of Lava&amp;rsquo;s isolated and often agricultural villages. The town of Yana was further recognised as Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;10th most beautiful city&amp;rdquo; in the architecture/holiday magazine &lt;em&gt;Alive&lt;/em&gt; in 2044.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;geography&#34;&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area around Yana is ringed by flower-tundras, though the settlements within it are characterised by low-lying grass plains and cold-weather mosses. Ancient lava flows form striking stone rivers across the interior of the borough, making it among Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s most alien inhabited landscapes. Thermal pools are common, scattered across the landscape like mirrors, and plumes of volcanic steam can be seen from all of its towns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;devils-geysers&#34;&gt;Devil&amp;rsquo;s Geysers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Devil&amp;rsquo;s Geysers are a series of four medium-to-small geysers about 20 kilometres outside of the Yana township. The largest of them, &lt;em&gt;Resmiousvizime&lt;/em&gt;, erupts every 10 minutes with a spurt of nearly 8 meters. They are surrounded by natural hot springs, which are popular among the locals and celebrated each year in a local festival called &lt;em&gt;Vis Cusmion&lt;/em&gt; or &amp;ldquo;Arrival of Steam&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;infrastructure&#34;&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yana is an agricultural borough typical of the western Lava Region, but its largest settlement, Yana, has seen its economy diversify in the postwar period to include scientific and industrial research on the applications of its many geothermal features. It has also attracted some attention as a quiet international tourist destination for foreigners eager to see geysers and mineral-pools first-hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;yana-lakehouse&#34;&gt;Yana Lakehouse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Yana loh Ouismaindesdenya&lt;/em&gt; (Yana Care Home) is a facility run by the &lt;em&gt;War Bureau of the Royal Commonwealth Armed Forces&lt;/em&gt; to rehabilitate and care for veterans returning home from combat. It arranges for both long-term and short-term programmes designed to reintroduce soldiers to civilian life. Some 750 people live on-site for anywhere between six months to five years where they take classes, receive treatment and therapy, and go on excursions throughout the Yana region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of Sciff, a small agricultural settlement in Yana&amp;rsquo;s West, lies the Thunderburo Geothermal Research Plant, a complex designed to pioneer emerging geothermal electricity production. Vekllei depends heavily on geothermal electricty for domestic consumption, and so considerable concern is given to advancing the efficiency of the Thunderburo&amp;rsquo;s so-called &amp;ldquo;Magma-Electric Commission&amp;rdquo;. About 250 research staff work out here, most commuting from Sciff or stationed on-site in company apartments.&lt;/p&gt;
