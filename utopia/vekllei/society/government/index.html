<blockquote class="book-hint pink">
  ߷ This article is about <a href="/utopia/vekllei"><strong>Vekllei</strong></a> society
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="book-hint panel">
  <strong>Vekllei</strong> is positioned uniquely between the anarchy and control. This article looks at its government, which facilitates and manages these competing instincts. As the representative of the Vekllei state, and the body of its human interests, the Vekllei Government is second only to the Sovereign in its authority over Vekllei society.
</blockquote>

<p><span class="fc">T</span>
<strong>he Government of Vekllei</strong> refers to both the <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#administration-of-the-interior">Administration of the Interior</a> of the Vekllei <a href="/utopia/vekllei/">Home Islands</a> and the <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#administration-of-the-commonwealth">international governing body</a> of the Vekllei Commonwealth. This article serves as a handbook to all departments of the Vekllei Government, and will help clarify the structure and responsibilities of its subordinate ministries and secretariats. These centralised features guide the busy and anarchic Vekllei economies to produce a standard of living unlike anywhere else in the world, celebrating departmentalised, forward-facing and vertically-organised government in the 21st Century.</p>
<h3 id="structure">Structure</h3>
<p>What we know as the Vekllei Government is portioned between several powerful state bodies, each representing the natural political concerns of the modern Vekllei state. These bodies are both autonomous and codependent, portioning the sovereignty and authority of the state across several These are, in order of</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Crown of Vekllei</strong> (also the <em>Crown Sovereign</em> and <em>Administration of the Crown</em> interchangeably), the rule of the Land Sovereign and its presence in the state</li>
<li><strong>The Commonwealth Government</strong> (also the <em>Parliament of the Commonwealth</em> and the <em>Administration of the Commonwealth</em> interchangeably), responsible for the maintenance, development and security of the Vekllei Commonwealth, including its territories</li>
<li><strong>The Interior Government</strong> (also the <em>Parliament of the Interior</em> and the <em>Administration of the Interior</em> interchangeably), responsible for the internal governance of Vekllei</li>
</ol>
<p>Under this arrangement, it is clear that the sovereignty of Vekllei and its Commonwealth members is somewhat obfuscated &ndash; the Crown, Commonwealth and Interior administrations all share overlapping <em>de facto</em> control over the affairs of Vekllei territories. In addition, the word &lsquo;Vekllei,&rsquo; commonly used to refer to the Vekllei Home Islands, is also used interchangeably to describe states beyond its geography. For example, the &lsquo;Vekllei Commonwealth&rsquo; in fact refers to membership in the Crown, of which Vekllei is an equal member but does not otherwise, in principle, control. The Kalina Islands, Kala, Demon and other full members of the Commonwealth are equal autonomous members, but nonetheless inherit the Vekllei name.</p>
<p>In this state of affairs, Vekllei can refer to the powerful member-state in the North Atlantic, the Commonwealth it belongs to, or, indeed, the Crown Sovereign itself. Unfortunately for foreigners, its use is generally dependent on context.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Vekllei Government is separated into two governing bodies.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Palace of the Vekllei Sovereign</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Government of the Atlantic Commonwealth, including Vekllei and the members of the Vekllei Commonwealth</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The following passages outline their structure and purpose as a general framework and reference for the political structure of the country.</p>

<blockquote class="book-hint panel">
  <strong>Since most Vekllei people</strong> catch a train each day, VNR is a uniquely intimate and treasured organ of the Vekllei state. It is somehow exempted from the public apathy and resentment of bureaucracy that targets other monopolies of the Vekllei state, and is routinely regarded as among the most beloved and appreciated &ldquo;companies&rdquo; in Vekllei.
</blockquote>

<p>The Government of Vekllei is made up of Ministries, Offices, Departments, Bureaus, Commissions, Directorates and Secretariats depending on the size, purpose and organisation of the organ.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="administration-of-the-interior">Administration of the Interior</h2>
<p>The <em>Administration of the Interior of the Government of Vekllei</em> (also known as the <em>Interior Government</em> or <em>Interior Parliament</em>) represents the human state of the Vekllei Home Islands, as well as its dependent possessions. It includes all 100 <a href="/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/">boroughs</a> of the Home Islands and its peripheral island possessions. Independent Commonwealth member-states Demon and Aismious lack the population to govern themselves independently, and so are dependent on the Interior Government.</p>
<p>The Interior Government is made up of 10 ministries.</p>
<h3 id="ministry-of-commerce">Ministry of Commerce</h3>
<b class="boxtag pink">
  COSMOSOL
</b>

<p>The Vekllei <em>Ministry of Commerce</em> (COSMOSOL) regulates and initiates trade in the country. Despite the functional moneylessness of the Commonwealth, COSMOSOL remains among the busiest ministries of the Interior Government, since all economic policy, international trade and entitled renumeration (the Vekllei turn-of-phrase for withdrawing from the <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#bank-of-vekllei">Labour Bank</a>) occurs through its subordinate commissions. Common responsibilities of COSMOSOL include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regulation and taxation of international trade, particularly through Government &lsquo;White Bonds&rsquo; and Labour Bank &lsquo;Blue Bonds&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Banking the Commonwealth state apparatus.</li>
<li>Advising the Parliament on economic policy and foreign trade.</li>
<li>Monitoring and reporting on the health of foreign markets.</li>
<li>Printing and transporting currency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vekllei has a reputation as a financial capital for its political neutrality and location between Europe and the Americas, and is among the largest facilitators of international commerce and exchange in the world.</p>
<blockquote class="section ">
  <h4 id="bank-of-vekllei">Bank of Vekllei</h4>
<p>The <em>Labour Bank of Vekllei</em> (commonly &ldquo;<em>Bank of Vekllei</em>&quot;) is the central bank and currency store of Vekllei. It is operated by the Ministry of Commerce and maintains branches in most major borough capitals in the Home Islands, as well as across all member states of the Vekllei Commonwealth. It is not autonomous and is beholden to the policy decisions of COSMOSOL and, in certain cases, the Interior and Commonwealth Parliaments. Its sworn purpose, as instructed by the Floral Constitution, is to advocate for Floral Economics.</p>
<p>The Bank of Vekllei was founded 1642 as the Royal Bank in <a href="/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/lola/">Lola</a>, and is the fifth oldest bank in the world.</p>
<p>Most banks in Vekllei are institutional or industrial, since the average Vekllei person is unmoneyed and, in a conventional definition, unbanked. Nonetheless, Vekllei maintains several commercial banks under the Bank of Vekllei umbrella, tasked primarily with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cashing and underwriting White and Blue bonds.</li>
<li>Selling government and financial (bureau) bonds internationally.</li>
<li>International placement and borrowing services.</li>
<li>Trading, settling and selling foreign currencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vekllei citizens are entitled to an equal share of the money stored in the Labour Bank, and in certain circumstances may withdraw their balance to emigrate or travel abroad.</p>
<p>Despite foreign perception of Vekllei economics, the liquid and asset holdings of the Bank of Vekllei make it the second-largest bank in the world.</p>
<h5 id="commonwealth-bank-of-vekllei">Commonwealth Bank of Vekllei</h5>
<p>The <em>Commonwealth Bank of Vekllei</em> (COMMBANK) is an international investment subsidiary of the Bank of Vekllei, tasked primarily with banking in Commonwealth members and international markets. It has branches across every Commonwealth member-state and in most major economic hubs around the world, including throughout Europe, the Americas, and Asia. It also serves as the Central Bank of the Kalina Isles.</p>
<h5 id="import-export-bank-of-vekllei">Import-Export Bank of Vekllei</h5>
<p>The <em>Import-Export Bank of Vekllei</em> (VEKEXIM) is a state policy investment bank used to fund projects outside of the Commonwealth, particularly in developing countries. It is the primary investment mechanism of Vekllei foreign aid system, which uses export credits and low-interest bureau loans to build infrastructure overseas. It is among the most influential export banks in the world, and contributed to the Pan-African Railway and Hundred Dams projects as part of Vekllei&rsquo;s ongoing Trade Democracy economic scheme.</p>
<h5 id="development-bank-of-vekllei">Development Bank of Vekllei</h5>
<p>The <em>Development Bank of Vekllei</em> (DEVBANK) is a policy bank designed to organise and allocate funding for large-scale political projects, particularly in infrastructure. The Development Bank works as the engine of the Interior Government&rsquo;s policies, funded mostly with White Bonds issued internationally and labour-guaranteed certificates (a type of Blue Bond). It also creates loan arrangements, evaluates, and underwrites national government projects.</p>
<h5 id="petty-bureau-labour-bank-of-vekllei">Petty Bureau Labour Bank of Vekllei</h5>
<p>The <em>Petty Bureau Labour Bank of Vekllei</em> is the commercial lending bank of &lsquo;petty bureau&rsquo; company syndicates and their workers. Its primary function is bureau negotiation and lending in order to facilitate the economic development of private business in Vekllei. It also acts as an intermediary between petty bureau companies and other banks or government financial apparatuses.</p>
<h5 id="bureau-proper-labour-bank-of-vekllei">Bureau Proper Labour Bank of Vekllei</h5>
<p>The <em>Bureau Proper Labour Bank of Vekllei</em> is the commercial lending bank of &lsquo;bureau proper&rsquo; company syndicates and their workers. Similar to the <em>Petty Bureau Labour Bank</em>, it facilitates economic activity of bureaus and private industry primarily through asset management and mediation with the government and Bank of Vekllei.</p>

<p>The Vekllei <em>Ministry of Defence</em> (COSMOKOS) represents the Sovereign Armed Forces of the Vekllei Commonwealth in the Vekllei Government, which are consolidated under the Commonwealth Military Command. COSMOKOS does not exercise command authority over the armed forces of Vekllei, and serves instead as the ministerial liaison between the Commonwealth Military Command and the Interior Government. Common responsibilities of COSMOKOS include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recruitment of citizens and foreigners into the Commonwealth armed forces.</li>
<li>Procuring equipment to meet the Vekllei obligation towards the Commonwealth armed forces.</li>
<li>Training citizens and foreigners for the branches of the Commonwealth armed forces.</li>
<li>Conducting scientific military research.</li>
<li>Policing and security of Vekllei territories and waters.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="section ">
  <h4 id="armed-forces-of-vekllei">Armed Forces of Vekllei</h4>
<p>The <em>Armed Forces of Vekllei</em>, arranged under the COSMOKOS ministry, are unusual in that they do not have control directly over troops or equipment. The actual armed forces of Vekllei, known as the <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#royal-armed-forces-of-vekllei">Royal</a> or <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#royal-armed-forces-of-vekllei">Crown Armed Forces</a>, are a sovereign feature of the country and as such are placed under direct supervision of the Sovereign Administration &ndash; seperate from the Vekllei and Commonwealth governments.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Armed Forces of Vekllei, an agency-level body under control of COSMOKOS, is to integrate the Crown Armed Forces with the interior government, and facilitate the employ of Vekllei people in the Armed Forces.</p>

<p>The <em>Communications Bureau</em> is a bureau-level organisation of the Armed Forces responsible for coordinating public information about military activities.</p>
<h5 id="department-of-compulsory-service">Department of Compulsory Service</h5>
<p>The <em>Department of Compulsory Service</em> (DoCS, also CS) oversees the Vekllei Compulsory Service Scheme, a hybrid civilian/military conscription law that requires four years from each citizen between the ages of 18 and 32. Despite reporting to the Armed Forces of COSMOKOS, the DoCS does not facilitate widespread conscription and mobilisation of the civilian population, a role served by the <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#department-of-mobilisation">DoM</a>. Instead, it is responsible primarily for supervising the fulfilment of the Compulsory Service Scheme, and administrating the conscription and training of Vekllei citizens, including in civilian and industrial roles.</p>

<p>The <em>Department of Mobilisation</em> (DoM) is responsible for recruitment in peacetime, and conscription in the outbreak of war. In the Floral Period, Vekllei defensive doctrine aims to make the country &ldquo;ungovernable,&rdquo; requiring widespread mobilisation and training of the civilian population. Unlike the <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#department-of-compulsory-service">DoCS</a>, the DoM is concerned primarily with the combat effectiveness of the mobilised population, and is generally distinguished in its strategic military thinking.</p>

It includes the following branches.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>National Intelligence Branch</strong>: Coordination of intelligence gathered by security apparatuses with Armed Forces.</li>
<li><strong>Civilian Intelligence Branch</strong>: Coordination of intelligence gathered by industrial and civilian sectors (in occupied territories, for example) with Armed Forces and security apparatuses.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Intelligence Branch</strong>: Coordination of intelligence gathered by the Armed Forces with security apparatuses.</li>

Although it is the <em>de facto</em> office of communication with the Crown forces, in practice communication generally occurs directly with the relevant COSMOKOS department. The purpose of the Sovereign Liaison is mostly as a democracy-advocate, supervising the COSMOKOS departments as an anti-corruption watchdog similar to other democracy-advocates. It also ensures COSMOKOS operations do not affect sovereign operations</p>
