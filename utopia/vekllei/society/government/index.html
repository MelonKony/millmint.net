  <strong>Vekllei</strong> is positioned uniquely between the anarchy and control. This article looks at its government, which facilitates and manages these competing instincts.

</blockquote>

<p><span class="fc">T</span>
<strong>he Government of Vekllei</strong> refers to both the <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#administration-of-the-interior">Administration of the Interior</a> of the Vekllei <a href="/utopia/vekllei/">Home Islands</a> and the <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#administration-of-the-commonwealth">international governing body</a> of the Vekllei Commonwealth. This article serves as a handbook to all departments of the Vekllei Government, and will help clarify the structure and responsibilities of its subordinate ministries and secretariats. These centralised features guide the busy and anarchic Vekllei economies to produce a standard of living unlike anywhere else in the world, celebrating local, departmentalised and democratic government in the 21st Century.</p>

<h3 id="structure">Structure</h3>
<p>What we know as the &lsquo;Vekllei Government&rsquo; is portioned between several powerful state bodies, each representing the natural political concerns of the modern Vekllei state. These bodies are both autonomous and codependent, carving the sovereignty and authority of the state across several governing organs of varying size and scope. These are, in order of sovereignty:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Palace of the Vekllei Sovereign</strong>, the metaphysical manifestation of all Vekllei territory and its collective geographic, cultural and religious features. It represents the cumulative historical essence of the physical place of Vekllei, and bridges relationships between humans, nature and spirits. The Palace, as representative of the land itself, is the true sovereign of Vekllei and as such retains control over the armed forces of the Commonwealth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Governments of the Vekllei Commonwealth</strong> including, in order of authority:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Crown of Vekllei (also the <em>Crown Sovereign</em>, <em>Parliament of Spirits</em> and <em>Administration of the Crown</em> interchangeably), representing the rule of the Land Sovereign and its presence in the state.</li>
<li>The Commonwealth Government (also the <em>Parliament of the Commonwealth</em> and the <em>Administration of the Commonwealth</em> interchangeably), responsible for the maintenance, development and security of the Vekllei Commonwealth, including its territories.</li>
<li>The Interior Governments (also the <em>Parliaments of the Interior</em> and the <em>Administrations of the Interior</em> interchangeably), responsible for the internal governance of the Vekllei member-states, primarily used in reference to the interior parliaments of the Vekllei Home Islands.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Under this arrangement, it is clear that the sovereignty of Vekllei and its Commonwealth members is somewhat obfuscated &ndash; the Crown, Commonwealth and Interior administrations all share overlapping <em>de jure</em> control over the affairs of Vekllei territories. In addition, the word &lsquo;Vekllei,&rsquo; commonly used to refer to the Vekllei Home Islands, is also used interchangeably to describe states beyond its geography. For example, the &lsquo;Vekllei Commonwealth&rsquo; in fact refers to membership in the Crown, of which Vekllei is an equal member but does not otherwise, in principle, control as a legal metropole. The Kalina Islands, Kala, Demon and other full members of the Commonwealth are equal autonomous members, but nonetheless inherit the Vekllei name.</p>
<p>In this state of affairs, Vekllei can refer to the powerful member-state in the North Atlantic, the Commonwealth it belongs to, or, indeed, the Crown Sovereign itself. Unfortunately for foreigners, its use is generally dependent on context.</p>

  <div class="emoji" style="line-height: 100%;" id="whirlybat">-millmint</div>
</div>
<blockquote class="hint panel">
  <strong>Since most Vekllei people</strong> catch a train each day, VNR is a uniquely intimate and treasured organ of the Vekllei state. It is somehow exempted from the public apathy and resentment of bureaucracy that targets other monopolies of the Vekllei state, and is routinely regarded as among the most beloved and appreciated &ldquo;companies&rdquo; in Vekllei.
</blockquote>

<p>The Government of Vekllei is divided between two parliaments &ndash; the <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#parliament-of-the-interior"><strong>Interior Parliament</strong></a>, and the <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#parliament-of-the-commonwealth"><strong>Commonwealth Parliament</strong></a>. Neither is particularly subordinate to the other, and they serve different purposes in the lives of Vekllei people.</p>
<p>In general, the Interior Parliament is responsible for the standard of living in the Vekllei Home Islands and dependent autonomous regions like Demon and the Aismious islands. The Commonwealth Parliament is responsible for all features of the transnational Commonwealth superstate, standardising governance and state services while advocating for &lsquo;Floral Society&rsquo; under the Floral Constitution.</p>
<p>Together, these two parliaments make up the combined Government of Vekllei. It is made up of Ministries, Offices, Departments, Bureaus, Commissions, Directorates and Secretariats depending on the size, purpose and structure of the state body. This is the government that people living in the Vekllei Home Islands vote for, via the nonpartisan representatives system.</p>
<h2 id="parliament-of-the-interior">Parliament of the Interior</h2>
<p>The <em>Administration of the Interior of the Government of Vekllei</em> (also known as the <em>Interior Government</em> or <em>Interior Parliament</em>) represents the human state of the Vekllei Home Islands, as well as its dependent possessions. It includes all 100 <a href="/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/">boroughs</a> of the Home Islands and its peripheral island possessions. Independent Commonwealth member-states Demon and Aismious lack the population to govern themselves independently, and so are dependent on the Interior Government. Other members of the Commonwealth, including Kalina, Kala and Mira, have parliaments (also called Interior Administrations) similar to the Vekllei Administration of the Interior.</p>
<p>The Interior Government is made up of 10 ministries which retain total authority over the state in Vekllei.</p>
<div class="section ">
  <h3 id="ministry-of-commerce">Ministry of Commerce</h3>
<b class="boxtag pink">
  COSMOSOL
</b>
<p>The Vekllei <em>Ministry of Commerce</em> (COSMOSOL) regulates and initiates trade in the country. Despite the functional moneylessness of the Commonwealth, COSMOSOL remains among the busiest ministries of the Interior Government, since all economic policy, international trade and entitled renumeration (the Vekllei turn-of-phrase for withdrawing from the <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#bank-of-vekllei">Labour Bank</a>) occurs through its subordinate commissions. Common responsibilities of COSMOSOL include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regulation and taxation of international trade, particularly through Government &lsquo;White Bonds&rsquo; and Labour Bank &lsquo;Blue Bonds&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Banking the Commonwealth state apparatus.</li>
<li>Advising the Parliament on economic policy and foreign trade.</li>
<li>Monitoring and reporting on the health of foreign markets.</li>
<li>Printing and transporting currency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vekllei has a reputation as a financial capital for its political neutrality and location between Europe and the Americas, and is among the largest facilitators of international commerce and exchange in the world.</p>
<div class="outline ">
  <h4 id="bank-of-vekllei">Bank of Vekllei</h4>
<p>The <em>Labour Bank of Vekllei</em> (commonly &ldquo;<em>Bank of Vekllei</em>&quot;) is the central bank and currency store of Vekllei. It is operated by the Ministry of Commerce and maintains branches in most major borough capitals in the Home Islands, as well as across all member states of the Vekllei Commonwealth. It is not autonomous and is beholden to the policy decisions of COSMOSOL and, in certain cases, the Interior and Commonwealth Parliaments. Its sworn purpose, as instructed by the Floral Constitution, is to advocate for Floral Economics.</p>
<p>The Bank of Vekllei was founded 1642 as the Royal Bank in <a href="/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/lola/">Lola</a>, and is the fifth oldest bank in the world.</p>
<p>Most banks in Vekllei are institutional or industrial, since the average Vekllei person is unmoneyed and, in a conventional definition, unbanked. Nonetheless, Vekllei maintains several commercial banks under the Bank of Vekllei umbrella, tasked primarily with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cashing and underwriting White and Blue bonds.</li>
<li>Selling government and financial (bureau) bonds internationally.</li>
<li>International placement and borrowing services.</li>
<li>Trading, settling and selling foreign currencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vekllei citizens are entitled to an equal share of the money stored in the Labour Bank, and in certain circumstances may withdraw their balance to emigrate or travel abroad.</p>
<p>Despite foreign perception of Vekllei economics, the liquid and asset holdings of the Bank of Vekllei make it the second-largest bank in the world.</p>
<h5 id="commonwealth-bank-of-vekllei">Commonwealth Bank of Vekllei</h5>
<p>The <em>Commonwealth Bank of Vekllei</em> (COMMBANK) is an international investment subsidiary of the Bank of Vekllei, tasked primarily with banking in Commonwealth members and international markets. It has branches across every Commonwealth member-state and in most major economic hubs around the world, including throughout Europe, the Americas, and Asia. It also serves as the Central Bank of the Kalina Isles.</p>
<h5 id="import-export-bank-of-vekllei">Import-Export Bank of Vekllei</h5>
<p>The <em>Import-Export Bank of Vekllei</em> (VEKEXIM) is a state policy investment bank used to fund projects outside of the Commonwealth, particularly in developing countries. It is the primary investment mechanism of Vekllei foreign aid system, which uses export credits and low-interest bureau loans to build infrastructure overseas. It is among the most influential export banks in the world, and contributed to the Pan-African Railway and Hundred Dams projects as part of Vekllei&rsquo;s ongoing Trade Democracy economic scheme.</p>
<h5 id="development-bank-of-vekllei">Development Bank of Vekllei</h5>
<p>The <em>Development Bank of Vekllei</em> (DEVBANK) is a policy bank designed to organise and allocate funding for large-scale political projects, particularly in infrastructure. The Development Bank works as the engine of the Interior Government&rsquo;s policies, funded mostly with White Bonds issued internationally and labour-guaranteed certificates (a type of Blue Bond). It also creates loan arrangements, evaluates, and underwrites national government projects.</p>
<h5 id="petty-bureau-labour-bank-of-vekllei">Petty Bureau Labour Bank of Vekllei</h5>
<p>The <em>Petty Bureau Labour Bank of Vekllei</em> (SISTERBANK) is the commercial lending bank of &lsquo;petty bureau&rsquo; company syndicates and their workers. Its primary function is bureau negotiation and lending in order to facilitate the economic development of private business in Vekllei. It also acts as an intermediary between petty bureau companies and other banks or government financial apparatuses.</p>
<h5 id="bureau-proper-labour-bank-of-vekllei">Bureau Proper Labour Bank of Vekllei</h5>
<p>The <em>Bureau Proper Labour Bank of Vekllei</em> (MOTHERBANK) is the commercial lending bank of &lsquo;bureau proper&rsquo; company syndicates and their workers. Similar to the <em>Petty Bureau Labour Bank</em>, it facilitates economic activity of bureaus and private industry primarily through asset management and mediation with the government and Bank of Vekllei.</p>

<p>The <em>National Mint of Vekllei</em> (also the <em>Mint</em>) is the sole producer of currency in Vekllei, tasked with minting and melting the Vekllei Crown. It also regulates gold bullion in the country, and manufactures bullion for use in the International Market. It is headquartered in Vekllei Proper, in the Home Islands.</p>
<p>The Mint is the custodian of the Commonwealth Bullion Depository, which holds reserves of over 6,000 tonnes of gold bullion belonging to the Commonwealth and over 60 other countries, and is among the largest such reserves in the world.</p>
<p>The Mint is well-regarded internationally for the purity of its metals and intricate commemorative coins, leading international numismatics in colour and variety.</p>
</div>
<div class="outline ">
  <h4 id="vekllei-securities-commission">Vekllei Securities Commission</h4>
<p>The <em>Vekllei Securities Commission</em> (VECSEC) regulates securities in the Vekllei International Market. It advises fiscal decision-making to the Interior Parliament and legislates trade practices in the country, including the issuing and ownership of government bonds and bureau securities.</p>
<p>Since Vekllei citizens do not usually participate in the domestic securities markets, VECSEC lacks traditional legal authority over many of the foreign participants in its supervised markets, but does extradite and prosecute financial crime through the EUROVEK and USVEK extradition treaties. It includes the following departments.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>General Council</strong>: Advisory board to the Commonwealth.</li>
<li><strong>General Procuratorate</strong>: Enforcement of penalties and prosecution of financial crimes.</li>
<li><strong>Department of Financing and Stock Exchange</strong>: Regulation and monitoring of the Vekllei Stock Exchange and miscellaneous securities within the country.</li>
<li><strong>Department of International Markets</strong>: Regulation and monitoring of the Vekllei International Market and government bonds.</li>
<li><strong>Department of Investments and Trusts</strong>: Regulation and monitoring of the investments, securities and financial contracts of Vekllei citizens and companies.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="outline ">
  <h4 id="vekllei-trade-commission">Vekllei Trade Commission</h4>
<p>The <em>Vekllei Trade Commission</em> regulates consumer protections and antitrust law, and organises trade information from other ministries and supervisory bureaus into policy recommendations and legislation. The Trade Commission also monitors and reports the health of foreign markets, and conducts research into broader geopolitical financial interests, particularly as they compete with domestic interests. It includes the following departments.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Department of Consumer Affairs</strong>: Regulation of the consumer rights.</li>
<li><strong>Department of Market Affairs</strong>: Protection of fair markets and regulation of Bureau and Petty Bureau companies, including state monopolies.</li>

  COSMOCOM
</b>
<p>The <em>Ministry of the Commonwealth</em> (COSMOCOM) is the organ through which the Interior Government communicates and cooperates with the Commonwealth Administration and its Secretariats. Its primary responsibility is cooperation between member states and standardisation, and publishes reports and manuals towards this goal. It is also the primary ministry through which the parliaments and secretariats of the Commonwealth communicate with the Interior Government. COSMOCOM is also responsible for ensuring changes made to the Floral Constitution are implemented domestically. Common responsibilities of COSMOCOM include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advising, training and auditing local accreditation and qualifications in line with Commonwealth standards and directives.</li>
<li>Ensuring that the Vekllei interior state meets standards determined by the Commonwealth parliaments and international commitments.</li>
<li>Developing and enforcing standards in technical, industrial and brand features of the Vekllei Interior Government and its responsible state assets and bureau partners.</li>
<li>Training and maintaining the workforce for the Interior civil service and Interior state assets in line with Commonwealth standards and directives.</li>
</ul>
<p>COSMOCOM&rsquo;s commitments to the transnational Commonwealth Parliaments go both ways &ndash; the ministry ensures domestic compliance and also advises Commonwealth policy and standards, since the Vekllei Interior Government is the largest and most industrious member-state of the Commonwealth.</p>
<div class="outline ">
  <h4 id="accreditation-directorate">Accreditation Directorate</h4>
<p>The <em>Accreditation Directorate</em> (also <em>Qualifications Vekllei</em> or VAD) is a transnational auditor of industrial, commercial and academic qualifications in Vekllei. VAD also develops technical and procedural standards for its responsible commercial and industrial partners. VAD also interfaces directly with international standards organisations on behalf of its subordinate auditors.</p>
<p>Standards in education for teachers and staff are generally developed and audited by the <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#commonwealth-education-secretariat">Commonwealth Education Secretariat</a>.</p>
<p>VDA also maintains a catalogue of products and technical manuals available to industry partners, and enforces compliance for industrial and commercial standards through its subordinate inspectorate.</p>
<h5 id="vekllei-qualifications-commission">Vekllei Qualifications Commission</h5>
<p>The <em>Vekllei Qualifications Commission</em> (ADQC) is the primary research organ of the VAD, and develops most of the qualifications standards and procedure policies of government ministries and state assets. Its research is primarily civil, since industrial and commercial qualifications are generally developed by the <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#standardisations-directorate">Standardisations Directorate</a>.</p>
<h5 id="vekllei-industrial-audit-committee">Vekllei Industrial Audit Committee</h5>
<p>The <em>Vekllei Industrial Audit Committee</em> (ADIA) is the primary audit and survey body of heavy and chemical industries, and is made up of representatives and technical representatives from its responsible industries. The Industrial Audit Committee also conducts most industrial audits, escalating breaches to the <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#inspectorate-vekllei">Inspectorate</a> only where prosecution in court is required.</p>
<h5 id="vekllei-commons-audit-committee">Vekllei Commons Audit Committee</h5>
<p>The <em>Vekllei Commons Audit Committee</em> (ADCA) is the primary audit and survey body of commercial organisations and laboratories. Like <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#vekllei-industrial-audit-committee">VADIAC</a>, the Commons Audi Committee is a civilian auditor made up of industry representatives and forwards criminal breaches towards the <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#inspectorate-vekllei">Inspectorate</a>.</p>
<h5 id="inspectorate-vekllei">Inspectorate Vekllei</h5>
<p>The <em>Vekllei Inspectorate</em> surveys and audits technical standards in business, research and industry for the Interior Parliament as the law-enforcement arm of the Accreditation Directorate. Breaches of Commonwealth standards are generally prosecuted in the Commonwealth Courts by the <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#industrial-standards-of-vekllei">INSTA</a> and <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#commercial-standards-of-vekllei">COMSTA</a> arms of <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#standardisations-directorate">Standards Vekllei</a>.</p>
<p>The Inspectorate acts an appeals board for civil breaches of VAD technical standards. It includes the following groups.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Survey and Testing Group</strong>: Superior investigative outfit designed to investigate breaches of technical standards.</li>
<li><strong>Industrial and Laboratory Safety Group</strong>: Specialised health and safety compliance investigation.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Group</strong>: Legal advisory office for prosecuting domestic breaches and preparing reports for Commonwealth prosecution.</li>

  <h4 id="standardisations-directorate">Standardisations Directorate</h4>
<p>The <em>Standardisations Directorate</em> (SSD, also Standards Vekllei) works to unify management and supervision of state bodies and assets in Vekllei. It also mandates the responsibilities and visual identity of all departments of the Government and boroughs of the Commonwealth, including the appearance and manuals of style of Commonwealth infrastructure and publications. Its work includes both operating procedures and major brand elements like flags and logos, and specific linguistic and typographic features including typefaces, preferred punctuation and symbols. It has considerable authority over other departments, which usually lack autonomy to enforce their own visual identity independently. Most visual work for the Standardisations Directorate is performed by in-house designers and artists.</p>
<p>The Standardisations Directorate also represents Vekllei in the International Organisation for Standardisation and other industrial standards bodies.</p>
<h5 id="standards-vekllei">Standards Vekllei</h5>
<p>The <em>General Office of the Standardisations Directorate</em> (GOSED), commonly <em>Standards Vekllei</em>, administrates the directorate, and determines its operations through direct liaison with the Interior and Commonwealth Administrations.</p>
<h5 id="standards-press-of-vekllei">Standards Press of Vekllei</h5>
<p>The <em>Standards Press</em> is a publishing house organised vertically in the SSD to prepare and publish materials including technical manuals, standard compilation books, and industrial bulletins.</p>
<h5 id="industrial-standards-of-vekllei">Industrial Standards of Vekllei</h5>
<p>The <em>Industrial Standards of Vekllei</em> (INSTA) regulates industrial regulatory and safety standards of industrial and manufacturing work. It also advises industry groups on product certification, and acts as a Commonwealth prosecutor in criminal breaches of industrial standards. INSTA is divided into sixteen technical committees that oversee particular industries. INSTA prosecutes cases of severe negligence or breach of Commonwealth standards, and advises domestic prosecution towards the <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#inspectorate-vekllei">Accreditation Inspectorate</a>.</p>
<h5 id="commercial-standards-of-vekllei">Commercial Standards of Vekllei</h5>
<p>The <em>Commercial Standards of Vekllei</em> (COMSTA) regulates Commonwealth standards of small and medium-sized commercial businesses that are otherwise unaffiliated with bureaus proper. It also advises <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#standards-vekllei">GOSED</a> on changes to its technical, safety and design committees. It also routinely interfaces with the <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#vekllei-commons-audit-committee">ADCA</a> for internal standards compliance.</p>
<p>Since private commerce in Vekllei exists outside of the bureau framework, the license of COMSTA is broader and flexible, and regularly relies upon contracted industry contacts to fill places on its less defined technical committees.</p>

<div class="outline ">
  <h4 id="state-assets-directorate">State Assets Directorate</h4>
<p>The <em>State Assets Directorate</em> manages state-owned companies across the Commonwealth, particularly those with considerable international trade. These include several major industrial companies in Vekllei, like General Reactor S.A. and International Rocketry S.A.

  COSMOKOS
</b>
<p>The Vekllei <em>Ministry of Defence</em> (COSMOKOS) represents the Sovereign Armed Forces of the Vekllei Commonwealth in the Interior Government, which are consolidated under the Commonwealth Military Command. COSMOKOS does not exercise command authority over the armed forces of Vekllei, and serves instead as the ministerial liaison between the Commonwealth Military Command and the Interior Government. Common responsibilities of COSMOKOS include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recruitment of citizens and foreigners into the Commonwealth armed forces.</li>
<li>Procuring equipment to meet the Vekllei obligation towards the Commonwealth armed forces.</li>
<li>Training citizens and foreigners for the branches of the Commonwealth armed forces.</li>
<li>Conducting scientific military research.</li>
<li>Policing and security of Vekllei territories and waters.</li>
</ul>
<p>COSMOKOS also provides security services domestically, and is responsible for most internal police and security organisations in Vekllei.</p>
<div class="outline ">
  <h4 id="armed-forces-of-vekllei">Armed Forces of Vekllei</h4>
<p>The <em>Armed Forces of Vekllei</em>, arranged under the COSMOKOS ministry, are unusual in that they do not have control directly over troops or equipment. The actual armed forces of Vekllei, known as the <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#royal-armed-forces-of-vekllei">Royal</a> or <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#royal-armed-forces-of-vekllei">Crown Armed Forces</a>, are a sovereign feature of the country and as such are placed under direct supervision of the Sovereign Administration &ndash; seperate from the Vekllei and Commonwealth governments.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Armed Forces of Vekllei, an agency-level body under control of COSMOKOS, is to integrate the Crown Armed Forces with the interior government, and facilitate the employ of Vekllei people in the Armed Forces.</p>

<p>The <em>Department of Compulsory Service</em> (DoCS, also CS) oversees the Vekllei Compulsory Service Scheme, a hybrid civilian/military conscription law that requires four years from each citizen between the ages of 18 and 32. Despite reporting to the Armed Forces of COSMOKOS, the DoCS does not facilitate widespread conscription and mobilisation of the civilian population, a role served by the <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#department-of-mobilisation">DoM</a>. Instead, it is responsible primarily for supervising the fulfilment of the Compulsory Service Scheme, and administrating the conscription and training of Vekllei citizens, including in civilian and industrial roles.</p>

<p>The <em>Department of Mobilisation</em> (DoM) is responsible for recruitment in peacetime, and conscription in the outbreak of war. In the Floral Period, Vekllei defensive doctrine aims to make the country &ldquo;ungovernable,&rdquo; requiring widespread mobilisation and training of the civilian population. Unlike the <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#department-of-compulsory-service">DoCS</a>, the DoM is concerned primarily with the combat effectiveness of the mobilised population, and is generally distinguished in its strategic military thinking.</p>
<h5 id="department-of-peacekeeping">Department of Peacekeeping</h5>

Intelligence gathering in Vekllei is performed by a variety of mostly autonomous espionage organs, and the purpose of the Liaison is to authenticate and prepare intelligence for military use. It includes the following branches.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>National Intelligence Branch</strong>: Coordination of intelligence gathered by security apparatuses with Armed Forces.</li>
<li><strong>Civilian Intelligence Branch</strong>: Coordination of intelligence gathered by industrial and civilian sectors (in occupied territories, for example) with Armed Forces and security apparatuses.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Intelligence Branch</strong>: Coordination of intelligence gathered by the Armed Forces with security apparatuses.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="sovereign-liaison">Sovereign Liaison</h5>
<p>The <em>Sovereign Liaison</em> is a specialised office intended to link the <a href="/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#royal-armed-forces-of-vekllei">Royal Armed Forces of Vekllei</a> with COSMOKOS, an interior ministry with no direct control over troops of the Crown. Although it is the <em>de facto</em> office of communication with the Crown forces, in practice communication generally occurs directly with the relevant COSMOKOS department. The purpose of the Sovereign Liaison is mostly as a democracy-advocate, supervising the COSMOKOS departments as an anti-corruption watchdog similar to other democracy-advocates. It also ensures COSMOKOS operations do not affect sovereign operations</p>
