	  <description> ‚ö†Ô∏è This list is evolving, and will be expanded in future. The Vekllei Document System is an internal circular provided by the Government of Vekllei to direct policy. They do not represent policy in depth &amp;ndash; rather, documents are issued discretely to relevant ministries and outline the direction or spirit of policy. Historically, they announce major events and actions. Documents üìÑDocument No. 1 üìÑDocument No. 9 </description>

	  <description>Overview # ﬂ∑ This article is UNFINISHED. It will be completed in the next couple of days. Education emerged as a foundational right for Vekllei people in the constitution of the 4th Commonwealth, in the spirit of postwar democratisation and the rising of all people. The colloquial turn-of-phrase for the domestic Vekllei economy is &amp;ldquo;functionally moneyless,&amp;rdquo; but the actual mechanisms of the internal Vekllei market is considerably more complex. While the average Vekllei person is insulated from money and money-management, their Commonwealth is a major entrep√¥t[^1] and has a reputation as an &amp;ldquo;Atlantic Middleman.</description>

	  <description>Overview # ﬂ∑ This article is about Vekllei Even if they do not use money, Vekllei people do have finances and engage with markets, maintain business relations and acquire financial instruments for upward mobility. The Vekllei state, on the other hand, is an enthusiastic participant in the global financial system and uses its considerable advantages enabled by the isolated moneyless Vekllei economy to accomplish its strategic political interests. The colloquial turn-of-phrase for the domestic Vekllei economy is &amp;ldquo;functionally moneyless,&amp;rdquo; but the actual mechanisms of the internal Vekllei market is considerably more complex.</description>

	  <description>Overview # ﬂ∑ This article is about Vekllei Large segments of the Vekllei economy are dominated by industries of the state, as both direct ministerial privileges and state-owned enterprises. In total, they form the basis of the basic Vekllei standard of living, holding back catastrophe through reliable overproduction where gaps in the participatory economy might threaten serious shortages. There is no real distinction in Vekllei between state assets, state-owned enterprises (SOE) and government-owned corporations (GOC), and the terms are used interchangeably.</description>
