It is named after Bakur, an ancient fishing town with history that predates unified settlement in Vekllei. It has the smallest population of any borough in Vekllei, at only 7,500 permanent residents, which fluctuates seasonally. It is most famous for being home to the site of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Deep-Sea Cartography Mission, an initiative of the Ocean Office of the Vekllei Government. This also means Bakur has the highest population of scientific personnel per capita of any borough in Vekllei.\nHistory Artefacts recovered from north of the town of Aya in Bakur date to nearly 1000BC, approaching earliest estimates of known settlement in the Vekllei Home Islands. Bakur\u0026rsquo;s first residents were likely nomadic arctic peoples immigrating from nearby Kala (Greenland) looking for hunting grounds in winter. Sagas confirm the town of Bakur was established in the 14th Century AD to support the creation of an arctic naval fort, but the fort was abandoned less than a hundred years later and few residents remained, leaving Bakur mostly abandoned until the early 19th Century, when it was reestablished as a base of operations for Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s colonial whaling fleet. Today it remains a shrinking fishing town, bolstered only by seasonal workers imported by the Ocean Office.\nThe town is the birthplace of celebrated Vekllei folk songwriter Tohs Viskaismesn (1847-1912).\nGeography The Bakur borough is home to some of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s most spectacular subarctic scenery, dominated lava slopes, ice fields, and fjords.

It is named after Eyri, an isolated coastal community employed mostly in controlled aquaculture by the Ocean Bureau. This quiet borough abounds with myth and legend related to its long seafaring history, emphasised only by the colossal wreck of the nearby icebreaking submarine Sea Serpent.\nHistory Eyri was settled early in Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s history, as sagas describe several coastal settlements established across North Afouismeh around 1000BC, suggesting a founding date similar to its neighbouring boroughs. Eyri\u0026rsquo;s past is much more difficult to trace than its neighbours, however, as its cliffs have been significantly eroded and with them the earliest traces of settlement of the area. Like most towns of this period, Eyri relied heavily on fishing for food, and as existing fish stock was depleted near shore Eyri\u0026rsquo;s people had to venture further and further out into open water to fish. It is often suggested that Eyri is one of several northwestern coastal boroughs responsible for the extinction of the Grey-Fin Tuna in the 16th Century.\nFor its small population of some 45,000 people, it has produced a remarkable number of famous artists, including naval painter Olivia Semesns (1863-1912) and frontman for Ko Ko Sizi Danosson (2015-).\nIn the early 2020s, Eyri saw tremendous investment by the Ocean Bureau into aquaculture infrastructure along its coast. Some 20% of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Atlantic Salmon stock are raised here, which is remarkable considering Eyri makes up only 0.18% of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s human population.\nGeography Eyri is known best for its cliffs, which watch over fjords and beaches pummelled by enormous Atlantic swells and icebergs. Along the coast the roar of the ocean can always be heard. Eyri is also known, somewhat unfortunately, for its miserable rain and cold weather, as most of its towns are situated between the Osmo mountain ranges which funnel in cold arctic air.\nTowns  Eyri Kis Ice Town   Posts  Killing a Sea Serpent    ","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/eyri/","title":"Eyri"},{"content":" #headerbox .emoji { margin-right: 85px; } .markdown a { color: var(--color-red); } .markdown a.anchor { color: var(--color-red); } aside nav ul a { color: var(--color-red); } #headerbox .emoji { color: var(--color-red); } .markdown img[alt=smallimg]{ display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%; } /* coins */ .row { display: flex; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; } .column { flex: 33.33%; padding: 5px; } @media (max-width: 1250px) { .row { display: none; } }  ﬂ∑ This article is about Hobart\u0026rsquo;s utopia, called Vekllei  Quick Facts  Vekllei is a utopia, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean I don\u0026rsquo;t take it seriously or consider its society pragmatically.

It remains a good testament to my love of Ghibli. It was originally submitted in October 2020 and published in December 2020.   Abstract T his thesis looks to argue for the value of spatiality in several films of the Studio Ghibli franchise in Japan. Literary space, much like the cartography of the real world, helps map meaning and locate the human body in the contemporary, postmodern displacement of old constructions. In this sense, there is a functional analogy in the physical map of a town, in which a reader is able to orient themselves and locate features of note around them. So too do the spaces of film provide functional markers of value, language, behaviour, style and story against space, recalling spatiotemporality as a vessel for each of them. If all films are spatial, then many of Ghibli‚Äôs films are often utopian spaces. This is found within and without traditional utopian study ‚Äî there are exemplary glimpses of pastoral, elegant utopia in My Neighbour Totoro (Tonari no Totoro, 1988), replicated in whimsy in other Miyazaki works like Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service (Majo no Takky≈´bin, 1989). There are however, more complicated utopias in the Ghibli catalogue that stray from orthodox imagination. Relevant to media inquiry, there are what this thesis recognises as utopias-by-appropriation in which the painterly depictions of urban Tokyo in Whisper of the Heart (Mimi o Sumaseba, 1995) or the beautiful illustrations of agrarian whimsy in Only Yesterday (Omoide Poro Poro, 1991) are decontextualised abroad and suspended in a traditional utopian ‚Äòno-place‚Äô, where they are reinterpreted and rebuilt as fantasy. So it is that the real-world apartments of Tama Hills and the fields of Yamagata can become fictitious, spatial utopias.\nAnd so, there are two questions of interest here. First, there is the question of employing the ‚Äòspatial turn‚Äô of textual analysis to Ghibli films, and whether this literary framework provides value in animation. Then, there is the question of how utopia-spaces manifest in Ghibli‚Äôs catalogue of films, and how the physical heritage and landscape of cinema is misplaced and then emerges anew in fantasy form for foreign (in the scope of this study, Western) audiences, where such works remain popular, thus manufacturing utopias where, perhaps, none exist in Japan.\n  Introduction  Space. The continual becoming: invisible fountain from which all rhythms must flow and to which they must pass. Beyond time or infinity.\n ‚Äî Frank Lloyd Wright1\nT he magic of the moving image reveals just how good our brains are at producing something from not much at all. Japanese anime, which is characterised by choppy frame rates, large plastic faces and gemstone eyes, somehow manages to produce authentic wonder and delight in audiences world-over. At some point in the production process, from cel drawing to foley work and voice dubbing, drawings come to life. There is perhaps no Japanese animation house in this business more celebrated and discussed in Western media scholarship than Studio Ghibli, which boasts a broad filmography that rattles off hit after hit. For many Westerners, some of whom go on to write about films in media studies, Ghibli was their gateway to anime. Their films are characterised by a deep respect for the life of cinema, and the authenticity of their characters. Other studios produce beautiful animation, and Disney films in particular feature more traditionally cinematic frame rates, but the lifelike, deeply friendly characters and worlds produced by Studio Ghibli are wholly unique experiences in cinema.\nThe main argument of this thesis is concerned with ‚Äòplace‚Äô, and how spaces are represented in animated films. There is also a utopian2 element at play here, which often assists this paper‚Äôs ‚Äòspatial turn‚Äô in textual analysis. The employ of these frameworks is not completely unthinkable, if perhaps a little unusual ‚Äî utopia and spatiality are linked by their mutual concern with time and place. Literary spatiality is in part cartographical, often acting first as a crucible to navigate and understand events and then as a framework to contextualise those events against other phenomena. Rob Shields (1997) found that ‚Äúspatial relations are constantly overcoded with social significance [‚Ä¶] it comes as no surprise to most people that the where and the when of events are as significant as what those events are‚Äù (p.187). This reflects nicely the capabilities of utopian studies, which considers utopias to be social narratives bound to space and time. Lyman Sargent (1994), whose work has come to define much of utopia scholarship, wrote as much in his broad taxonomies of utopia, arguing the ‚Äúgeneral phenomenon‚Äù of utopianism is ‚Äúsocial dreaming ‚Äî the dreams and nightmares that concern the ways in which groups of people arrange their lives and which usually envision a radically different society than the one in which the dreamers live‚Äù (p. 3). In fact, this dependence on spatiotemporality is deeply ingrained in the tradition of utopian studies, from Karl Mannheim‚Äôs 1929 Ideology and Utopia to Phillip Wegner‚Äôs recent (2002, 2010) work on utopian narratives in the 21st century. Perhaps then, it is easiest to identify spatial study in this paper as the textual interrogation of space, and utopian study as a combined in-text/metatextual concern, especially as it affects the production contexts and creators of these films.\nIn this context, the abstract appearance of utopian studies and spatiality gives way to much more practical local and textual analyses, and for the purposes of this paper they suit well the dynamic, wonderful and deeply spatial films of Studio Ghibli. The majority of feature films produced by the Japanese animation house provide wholly unique and valuable insights into various arenas of life. This is not an unpopular opinion, and is reflected in the existing scholarship of Ghibli‚Äôs catalogue. Amidst a mountain of work can be found explorations of Ghibli‚Äôs long history of female protagonists and ‚Äúblindness to gender‚Äù (Iles, 2005); Ghibli as a cultural bridge between Japanese anime and American animation (Hern√°ndez-P√©rez, 2016); Ghibli as a case study of marketing and audience reception domestically and abroad (Denison, 2007); Ghibli as arguments for pacifism (Akimoto, 2013 \u0026amp; Schipperges, 2018); environmentalism (Le Blanc and Odell, 2019); feminism (Kono, 2017); flight and aerospace (Amzad-Hossain and Fu, 2014); and so on. My concern is primarily for its physical representation of these ‚Äúworlds,‚Äù and particularly as they represent and depict society ‚Äî entering into the space of ‚Äúsocial dreams,‚Äù as a utopian premise.\nThe question, then is not of Ghibli‚Äôs relevance to Western media scholarship, but the argument of spatial and utopian dimensions in its work. ‚ÄòUtopia‚Äô is a deeply loaded, politicised term, but I would argue that it is not necessarily the case that Ghibli is advocating political interests. Although utopia is political and these spaces are quite often political, the presence of politics does not necessarily render a text categorically ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù. I think the films represented in this thesis advocate dimensions of the dreams of their creators (who, in the subsequent chapters are Hayao Miyazaki3 and Isao Takahata), and although these dreams are bound to these directors and their environments, they also invoke emotional and personal spaces too. This multidimensionality is part of the depth that characterises the studio‚Äôs work, and so I would caution the presence of a utopian framework as an indictment of these films as fundamentally political.\nSocial Dreams and Imagined Communities Although what constitutes a ‚Äòutopia‚Äô is applied more broadly in utopian frameworks than in popular imagination, the basic premise is the same ‚Äî utopias are imaginary worlds that reflect some part of a worldview, inspired by contemporaneous circumstances. They can be good places, called eutopia, or bad places, known as dystopia, but at their core they are grounded in the perspective of their creator (Sargent, 1994). A utopian framework, as it applies to Ghibli, seeks out these perspectives through textual analysis, and by situating statements and published opinions of the creator against their texts. This allows a better understanding of these films among their contemporary cinema landscape, and helps situate them not just as stories but as texts in themselves historically. Utopian frameworks illustrate new dimensions to placing and understanding individual moments and scenes in films, as well as clarify the context and history of a work in broader analysis of its genre.\nWhereas utopian frameworks examine texts as objects of context, literary spatiality is concerned primarily with how space and landscape are depicted on a functional level (Tally, 2013). In Ghibli‚Äôs case, space is often depicted through detailed watercolour background plates, and the study of spatiality scales cleanly here between individual shots, scenes and broader conceptual linkages of space and time. These spaces hold specific cultural implications, as well as contribute to narratives through the automatic transcendental ‚Äòcartography‚Äô audiences produce as they navigate a fictional world.\nGhibli‚Äôs house style for background art is painterly, saturated, and consistently detailed. This lends to a beautified landscape that, through the talent of the artist, renders even the most dismal, industrial backgrounds in a warm picturesque light. It is easy to imagine how this phenomenon has implications for space, and with space arrive questions of cartography, or how space is mapped in the mind (Tally 2013, p. 2). Indeed, the idea of a ‚Äòmap‚Äô is a good analogy for the way in which our minds process space in imaginary worlds in linear narratives. Spatiotemporality exists on a foundational level beneath abstracted narrative textual ideas, and is alive in its relationships to other spaces and the order in which they‚Äôre presented. This ‚Äòspatial turn,‚Äô as it‚Äôs often called (Warf and Arias, 2008), allows us to examine landscape not just as coded cultural vessels in themselves (as products of culture), but as stories in themselves, through their arrangement and depiction in texts.\nAn Argument for Spatiality To apply this in a tangible cultural space, we can look to Kojin Karatani, the multidisciplinary Japanese scholar minimised here as a literary critic, who interrogated epistemically this ‚Äòspatial turn‚Äô in his seminal 1996 book Origins of Modern Japanese Literature. His work provided a foundation for the epistemological births of various ‚Äòlandscapes‚Äô in the chaotic Meiji period, during which Japan rapidly Westernised in the mid-19th century. Karatani documents exhaustively the origins of new literary artefacts that usurped and obscured prior Japanese cultural institutions, including depictions of Landscape, the discovery of Interiority, the discovery of the Child, and so on. These concepts in themselves constitute spaces; landscape through its obvious physicality, interiority through its private subjectivity, and the Child through its relationship with cultural assumptions of life-stages and life-spans. It is precisely this work that informs the titles of each section in this thesis, loosely grouping disparate films together against their relevance to these cultural vessels. More critically, Karatani observes the introduction if these concepts as a profound and irreversible shift in the way stories were told, as placeless pictographic poetry was abandoned for the modern novel (pp.45-53) and nature was, for the first time, described in terms of literalist, real physical place rather than transcendental terms (pp.19-26). This is the ‚Äúdiscovery‚Äù of Landscape ‚Äî a word that here describes not the ability to see place but the emergence of real place as a distinct, alien other. In other words, Japan‚Äôs great ‚Äòspatial turn‚Äô.\nWithin the concern of this thesis then, these valuable textual signifiers are used in a broader argument for Ghibli‚Äôs overall relevance as an animation house of ‚Äúgreat cinematic spaces.‚Äù This will be accomplished in a somewhat multidisciplinary approach involving both the aforementioned utopian and spatial frameworks, and will move vertically between traditional textual analysis and broader efforts at recognising and categorising generic trends and leitmotifs within the Ghibli catalogue, and their distinguishing spatial qualities as cultural vessels. This necessarily recalls a transnational paradigm, at least partially, since (like much of English-language Ghibli scholarship) the ‚Äòuniversal nostalgia‚Äô described here and in the title of this paper is founded in my own experiences with these films in a Western cultural context. It is only appropriate then that care is given to situate these films historically and in the contexts of their filmmakers, in the tradition of both frameworks outlined so far.\nMore specific to the aim of this thesis in establishing the spatial value of Ghibli films, no film will be invoked as a single example of all elements of exceptional spatial filmmaking; instead, what I observe to be the most valuable elements of each text will be applied to a multitextual, straightforward argument for Ghibli‚Äôs recognition overall. This contributes to the primary concern of this thesis: how has Studio Ghibli employed and represented space, and what components of Ghibli‚Äôs spatiality contributes to its importance in ongoing analysis into animation?\nTo assist, a broad sample of films from across the studio‚Äôs history have been conscripted here, from all corners of the studio‚Äôs social temperament. Released between 1988 and 2001, there are both older and newer Ghibli films than are depicted here, and the selection is not comprehensive of all directors to have produced works in the studio. Instead, the following films have been selected for their memorable use of space ‚Äî their ‚Äòimmersive spatiality‚Äô. For the purposes of this essay, spatiality also invokes the temporal dimension ‚Äî acknowledging the fluid back-and-forth between physical space and history, both of which form critical aspects of a broader utopian dialectic. Much as utopias are products of their times, the films of Studio Ghibli are found in a similar grounded epistemology, drawing genre and landscape from real-world spatiotemporality.\nSix films are depicted here, divided into three sections. Section one, Spatiality and Abstraction, introduces key arguments for abstracted landscapes, including the only ‚Äòfantastical‚Äô setting included in this thesis. The first, My Neighbour Totoro (1988), is a wonderful example of utopian instinct ‚Äî both sentimental and rigorously secular‚Äî in its depiction of a pastoral, agrarian community without ‚ÄòLandscape‚Äô. Using My Neighbour Totoro, this thesis will introduce the groundbreaking multidisciplinary analysis of the aforementioned literary critic Karatani Kojin, and apply his dialectic of the discovery of landscape to interrogate the universal nostalgia of pastoralism and childhood. In a similar fashion, but in a remarkably different setting, there is Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service (1989), a charming film about self-discovery as cast against mythical depictions of the universal ‚ÄúEuropean Cityscape,‚Äù which is found replicated time and time again in Japanese depictions of so-called Old Europe. Breaking new ground, this study will look to source and identify the physicality of Kiki‚Äôs world, and document how it contributes to a utopia as ‚Äúalternate history‚Äù. This effort will draw upon the work of Susan Napier and her seminal work The Fantastic in Modern Japanese literature, employing its scholarship as a historical framework in which to situate Kiki‚Äôs deeply historical world.\nThe next section concerns itself with Interiority and Reproduction, and argues for people-as-utopias insofar as characters can transcend and consequently come to determine places and times. This is not to simply suggest that people can also be landscapes ‚Äî rather that, within the medium of film, there is a relationship between characters and their landscapes, much as there is a relationship between the watercolour background and the animated cell, and this relationship produces a dialogue that affects the other. So it is, that in Takahata‚Äôs masterpiece Only Yesterday, that these boundaries are transcended through memory and interiority. This calls upon again Karatani‚Äôs own work (1993) into the emergence of interiority in Japanese literature, and produces a novel framework for the analysis of this film. In Only Yesterday, spatiotemporality is deplatformed from literalism to provide a visual representation of memory and emotion, incorporating the bittersweet, tragic, humorous and absurd in a nonchronological sequence of memories telling a deeply personal story. It introduces the audience to the height of Sh≈çwa postwar affluence in urban Tokyo ‚Äî the epoch of economic expansion and the Shinkansen ‚Äî and later contrasts this against the timeless agrarian communities of Yamagata in Northern Japan. Ghibli is well-documented for its positive depictions of nature, and its thematic overtones about landscape and stewardship are well represented by Only Yesterday here. To this end, Yoriko Moichi‚Äôs work on Japanese utopian literature helps us navigate these particular and specific dimensions of modern Japanese history, and introduces us to the fantastical as an element of Japanese utopianism.\nNext, The Wind Rises (2013) is a quasi-biographical account of aircraft designer Jiro Horikoshi leading up to and during the Second World War. This is the first of two films in this thesis to be set during the war, which devastated Japan and saw a culmination of the radical, dramatic shift in Japanese culture and politics that started in the Meiji restoration. In common use of utopia, a fascist colonial metropole seems hardly appropriate ‚Äî and yet, as a form of social dreaming, The Wind Rises succeeds. There are eutopias depicted in this otherwise dystopian filmscape ‚Äî Horikoshi‚Äôs employment at the Mitsubishi plant, the hotel in the mountains, the home of his employer ‚Äî all exist as signifiers of social refuge, and extraordinary spaces amidst extraordinary times. This fits well within the metaphor of a textual analysis of the film itself ‚Äî in which beautiful things cost terribly, and that impermanence and tragedy do not devalue them. These are places that simply do not exist in modern consumer society, as argued in this chapter ‚Äî and to that end, they demonstrate the lateral freedoms of social dreaming as a foundation of utopian studies, orthodox to Lyman Sargent‚Äôs work on utopian taxonomies.\nFinally, Ghibli‚Äôs generic trends of childhood and whimsy are recalled in the next section ‚Äî Childhood and Historicism, in which we return to specific places and times to explore Japan as depicted by Ghibli. Whisper of the Heart (1995), the final film of longtime Ghibli creative Kond≈ç Yoshifumi, depicts a blossoming romance in Tama Hills, and explicitly replicates several real-world landmarks. These are profoundly Japanese spaces ‚Äî filled with postwar concrete high schools, apartment lifestyles, shrines, trains, and the terraced concrete hills of West Tokyo. Calling upon Phillip Wegner, these spaces and ‚Äî unusually among Ghibli‚Äôs catalogue ‚Äî the contemporaneous setting, raise interesting questions about the inversion of what Robert Tally calls spatiotemporality. Universal markers of childhood ‚Äî young love, music, and self-doubt ‚Äî are cast against Japanese spaces at the height of the Japanese bubble economy. The tension between universality and provinciality in space ‚Äî depicted here as the schisms between real-world Japanese space and Japan-as-fantasy originating in the minds of audiences abroad ‚Äî is a critical example of the premise of this thesis.\nThis paper concludes with another depiction of Japan, though far removed from the pleasant domesticity of Tama Hills. We finally approach Takahata‚Äôs Grave of the Fireflies, placed adjacent to the conclusion of this paper for its synthesis of the twin concerns that drive this exploration ‚Äî namely spatiality as social dreaming, and the contextual dimensions of space within transnational products. Grave of the Fireflies is a wartime tragedy, released simultaneously (and not coincidentally) alongside My Neighbour Totoro. If the works depicted in this essay have trended chronologically towards the ‚Äòreal,‚Äô then the fact that Grave of the Fireflies adapts an autobiographical story of two children in the poverty of wartime Japan should push the utopian dialectic nurtured throughout this thesis to its breaking point ‚Äî landscape, interiority, universality, and memory are all being recalled here. It is perhaps Grave of the Fireflies that best exemplifies the tension between utopias and utopias-by-appropriation ‚Äî and raises questions regarding the depiction of suffering in specific places and times, and the enduring nature of this story across decades and borders. Does the fact that Grave of the Fireflies depicts Japanese civilians ‚Äî a population uncommon in the war films of former Allied countries ‚Äî affect its universality and interpretation abroad? If so ‚Äî what does it owe to that context, and how does spatiality inform its story\nFrom this summary of films, we can already see the trends and leitmotifs that characterise the work of the Japanese animation house. But there are interesting omissions of note, too ‚Äî particularly that, aside from Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service, these films are established to have concrete real-world locations, and, in the case of Whisper of the Heart, this thesis will visit these. Overall, this list constitutes much of Ghibli‚Äôs sober, less fantastical fair, hinged closely to moments and places that are either well-known or characterise aspects of Japanese history and contemporary landscape. This is, to some extent, a necessity while employing utopian and spatial frameworks, which are closely linked to the contexts of places and times. In other ways, however, this list characterises a broad sample of narratives and tones, from the placeless whimsical to historical war-drama, and will showcase well the breadth and depth of the total sum of films produced by the studio.\nIn summary, we can see in this introduction the foundations of a multidisciplinary analysis, blurring textual analysis and analysis of contexts within well-documented utopian and spatial epistemologies. There is perhaps no better case study in Japanese cinema presently than that of Ghibli‚Äôs catalogue, navigating in the rare vertices of artfulness and textual depth with approachability and mainstream success. Spatiality and time; body and interiority; memory and metaphysic ‚Äî these are the foundations of social dreaming, and within the rich visuality of the animated medium, in which all frames and shots are designed and nothing is simply a ‚Äúbackground,‚Äù utopian spatiality provides an excellent foundation upon which to explore these films.\n1. Spatiality and Abstraction Landscape in Miyazaki‚Äôs My Neighbour Totoro I f there is a single film of concern in this thesis that demonstrates a utopian, spatial dialectic within the films of Studio Ghibli, it is here, in 1988‚Äôs My Neighbour Totoro. The film showcases the dislocation of space common in Miyazaki‚Äôs work, and indicates at face value a landscape that transcends Miyazaki‚Äôs own lifetime as a sort of cross-generation nostalgia. So there is this contradiction, as is common in Miyazaki‚Äôs great stories, between progress and the past. This idea probably does not strike the reader as particularly novel ‚Äî environmentalism and balance is an obvious theme common throughout the broader Ghibli catalogue ‚Äî but ‚Äúprogress‚Äù and ‚Äúconservation‚Äù here are not situated in the context of the film‚Äôs release, nor are they broader gestures at grand ideas about the future and past. Rather, they are symptoms of the tension between ‚Äòold ways,‚Äô characterised by social community, locality and land dependence, and a plastic, uncertain modernity. Miyazaki describes My Neighbour Totoro as taking place in 1955, or thereabouts, but acknowledges that ‚Äúwhat [the production staff] had in mind was a ‚Äòrecent past‚Äô that everyone could relate to‚Äù (VIZ, 2005). He reinforces this point by describing his deliberate exclusion of personal nostalgia during the film in his semiautobiographical work Starting Point (2009, p. 355). In another interview, Miyazaki remarked:\n ‚ÄúA lot of people now are nostalgic for Japan as it was in the Showa ‚Äô30s, but it was actually an unhappy period for me. Why? I was frustrated because nature ‚Äî the mountains and rivers ‚Äî was being destroyed in the name of economic progress.‚Äù (Schilling, 2008).\n In the Japanese calendar, 1955 is the 30th year of Sh≈çwa, placing it in the height of a period broadly characterised by rapid economic development and construction after the Second World War. Of course, My Neighbour Totoro depicts a space far removed from the noisy urbanism rapidly developing in Japanese cities ‚Äî at odds with and even disrupting preconceptions of modernist progress. This submersion of capital-M Modernity is present throughout the film. In his seminal analysis of modernist instinct, Marshall Berman illustrated a vision of modern living remarkably hostile to the landscape of Totoro, arguing that 20th-century society ‚Äúspeeds up the whole tempo of life,‚Äù and severs ‚Äúmillions of people from their ancestral habitats, hurtling them half-way across the world into new lives,‚Äù as \u0026ldquo;rapid and often cataclysmic urban growth; systems of mass communication, dynamic in their development, [envelope] and [bind] together the most diverse people and societies [‚Ä¶]‚Äù (Berman, 1983, p. 16).\nFig. 1.1 Mei and Satsuki amidst the season‚Äôs produce  And yet, in Miyazaki‚Äôs childhood fantasy, we are presented a place of an excruciatingly agrarian pace of life, no depiction of commerce (and almost no recognition of the existence of money at all), of people dependent on place and history, living and moving into old, run-down homes in which even a telephone is a scarce feature. This depicts a sort of asymmetric timelessness, or, as utopian scholar Phillip Wegner argues, an ‚Äúalternate history,‚Äù in which the priorities of the postwar Japanese state have been totally inverted, and the consumer society that flourished under American occupation and democratisation was never introduced (Wegner, 2010). To use Marx‚Äôs phrase borrowed by Berman (1983), Miyazaki is, in some sense, recapturing solidity that, in our own world and in his childhood, had long since melted into air during the Meiji restoration. It is here that lies the distinction of Miyazaki‚Äôs place of tension from broader thematic depictions of the future and past, found not in contemporary anguish or conservative retrospection, but in a dislocation of spatiotemporality, building worlds that, while thoroughly Japanese and midcentury, do not really exist. This is not to argue that no such villages in Totoro existed in 1950s Japan ‚Äî the film was inspired by the Saitama prefecture outside Tokyo ‚Äî rather, that the textual spatiality of My Neighbour Totoro, per their construction in animation, are pulled from social dreams rather than merely depicted historically. It is by ‚Äòsocial dreaming‚Äô that this thesis distinguishes utopian instincts from fantasy, and it is by social dreaming that Ghibli‚Äôs films are able to reach and engage with the subliminal concepts. It is not the absence of telephones, or the depiction of animism that recalls a utopian spatial dialectic, but the whole inversion of priority that cascades and colours every part of the film.\nFig. 1.2 The family visits an old shrine buried deep in the forest  So, in demonstrating a vision of modern space without modernity, what remains in the film? Depleted of contemporary indicators, My Neighbour Totoro could be taken superficially as a sort of aimless conservatism, capturing the whimsy and nostalgia of the smallness of childhood. After all, it is through the childish lens of the sister protagonists that we see the forests and rice paddies of Totoro, and much of the film is dedicated to chronicling the pleasantly aimless activities of a four-year-old girl. As Wegner (2010) recognised, the ‚Äúnarrative utopia‚Äù has radical implications when we look to the deeper, underlying metaphysic that belongs to the ‚Äòdream‚Äô. Where overt themes are recognised, internalised and reproduced at a plot level, the way spatiality operates deep within Totoro introduces critical dimensions as to why the film makes such a powerful text for utopian spatiality ‚Äî specifically, its absence of landscape, childhood, and architecture.\nWe see here a dialectic introduced by literary critic and philosopher Karatani Kojin, and applied by Wegner (2010) in the case of Totoro. Karatani argues that, prior to the introduction of Western culture to Japanese art during the 19th century, the landscape metaphysic as we understand today did not exist (Karatani, 1998). This is, in effect, demythologising Western preconceptions about nature as an ‚Äúother;‚Äù returning a foreign, transcendental space to the physical world. Modern Japanese literature, Karatani argues, is inundated with such constructions ‚Äî and by their nature, these ‚Äúepistemological constellations‚Äù suppress their own origins, appearing as immutable objects; an undeniable physical fact. What Wegner argues for, and this thesis incorporates as a Japanese-utopian framework, is the ways in which Totoro and more broadly, Studio Ghibli, suppress such constructions, and how they reemerge abroad as global, transnational fantasy, since I argue that fantasy cannot exist without landscape.\nIn real terms, what do these constructions mean for the film? In terms of spatiality, My Neighbour Totoro is suspended in a sort of abstraction, pleasantly liberated from naturalistic, realist depictions of the world common to live-action cinema. As American film critic Roger Ebert described of another Ghibli film, Grave of the Fireflies:\n ‚ÄúThe characters are typical of much modern Japanese animation, with their enormous eyes, childlike bodies and features of great plasticity (mouths are tiny when closed, but enormous when opened in a child‚Äôs cry ‚Äî we even see Setsuko‚Äôs tonsils). This film proves, if it needs proving, that animation produces emotional effects not by reproducing reality, but by heightening and simplifying it, so that many of the sequences are about ideas, not experiences.‚Äù (Ebert, 2000.)\n Fig. 1.3 The family‚Äôs moving truck passes a roadside shrine  In this spirit, we can see Totoro‚Äôs suppression of literalist instincts for a sort of demonstrated, if not depicted, reality that absolves the schisms between place and person. There is much work in media criticism with the goal of teasing out buried Shinto iconography and situating My Neighbour Totoro in its cultural and historical context. This, I fear, suppresses the rich ambiguity and abstraction animation affords the film ‚Äî of course, the shrines depicted in the film belong to Shinto practices, and of course, the rice paddies, local railway and cultural behaviours are distinctly Japanese ‚Äî but within the pretext of Totoro as a ‚Äòdream,‚Äô or ‚Äúwhat-if,‚Äù as Wegner calls it, these images are reintroduced as new, if thoroughly Japanese-oriented, artefacts. Shinto is stripped of its historical and nationalistic implications and is reintroduced as a vessel for animism and a respect for all objects. Landscape is abolished and place is returned as a physical entity, standing once again only in its immediate physicality and utility. Even the child ‚Äî another one of Karatani‚Äôs constructions ‚Äî is reintroduced here with ageless burdens and complexities; in other words, a small, growing adult, far removed from the objectifying cultural force of modern education systems and children-as-consumers.\nAnd so there is a tension here ‚Äî perhaps, even a proud contradiction ‚Äî that exemplifies the richness of spirit in Miyazaki‚Äôs work. On one hand, there is the film‚Äôs undeniable contexts, founded deep in Miyazaki‚Äôs personal and political stories, and there is also the film‚Äôs wonderful demolition of such matters in place of a fictional, if Japanese, universality; a transnational appeal that sees this film delighting people across the world. That audience scalability, between local, regional and international viewing, is a recurring feature of Ghibli‚Äôs catalogue, and testifies to the underlying spatial and utopian vision‚Äôs widespread appeal.\n‚ÄòOld Europe‚Äô and prewar nostalgia in Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service U sing My Neighbour Totoro as a metric for spatiotemporal discussion in Ghibli, the next film arranged here marks a shift from the overt spatial questions of heavy concerns in literary history and metaphysics, towards the world of temporality, witchy semiotics and the delight of domestic fantasy. Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service, released a year after Totoro in 1989, is one of Ghibli‚Äôs ‚ÄòEuropean adventures,‚Äô a legacy traced all the way back to Miyazaki‚Äôs early work on Heidi, a Girl of the Alps in the 1970s (Le Blanc \u0026amp; Odell 2019, p. 29). In many ways, it is a suitable film to elaborate and build upon the concepts discussed in the previous section, for Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service, like My Neighbour Totoro, is quite easily characterised as the same alt-history ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù paradigm, displaced and rebuilt in a fictional European setting. Kiki, a young witch leaving home for the first time to develop her powers, finds her enemies not to be evil wizards of ancient evils, but self-doubt, money and loneliness. This marks what should be considered a critical shift in this ‚Äòwitch story‚Äô; its introduction to a domestic, personal space that appeals to both emotional narratives of development and self-discovery, and the petty fantasy of ‚Äòsmall magic‚Äô in an otherwise ordinary setting. Kiki does not wield tremendous magic power capable of altering history, either local or worldly ‚Äî she accomplishes that instead through her character and relationships.\nFig. 2.1 Kiki soars high above the roofs of Koriko on her broomstick  The film is set in the placeless town of Koriko, a 20th century coastal city in European fashion. As per the abstract wonder of animation, little is told and much is shown about life in this place. Agrarian quiet in My Neighbour Totoro is inverted here in a sort of fictitious European fantasy; a bustling seaside city of caf√©s, boutiques and, most importantly, bakeries. This is further illustrated in the context of Ghibli‚Äôs familiar utopian leitmotifs, as wonders of the golden age of air travel (the dirigible Spirit of Freedom) coexist with distinctly postwar artefacts in fashion, technology and teen-age culture. In the same sense that My Neighbour Totoro glimpses a vision of midcentury Japan in which the Meiji restoration might have never occurred, Koriko is a delightful European landscape in which it appears the Second World War never happened. This is remarked upon by Mio Bryce in a broader examination of Kiki‚Äôs depiction, describing Koriko as exhibiting a ‚Äústrong sense of retrospection and other-worldness‚Äù (Bryce 2006). It is not that Koriko is entirely foreign ‚Äî by most accounts, a young female witch in a European city should be superficially familiar to most Westerners ‚Äî but that instead Bryce recognises that the dichotomous relationship between Japan‚Äôs (post-Meiji) introduction to ‚Äòwitch stories‚Äô and the Western, Christian tradition of witch lore, and that the resulting product disarms Western presuppositions about European witches through its emphasis on ‚Äútransition,‚Äù rather than ‚Äútraining‚Äù. Kiki does not attend a school for witchcraft, or takes on mentorship, as Bryce notes (p. 43), but rather participates in a feminised tradition of self-discovery and place.\nThis results in a film in which, much like Totoro, Miyazaki‚Äôs masterful, amorphous storytelling cautions ambitious attempts to trace textual lineage to Japanese ‚Äúpredisposition\u0026rdquo; or storytelling tradition. Susan Napier‚Äôs landmark work, Anime: From Akira to Princess Mononoke, notes as much:\n ‚ÄúThe idea of a girl leaving home and setting up her own business would be surprising in any culture but particularly so in Japan. In Kiki‚Äôs happy independence we see Miyazaki‚Äôs technique of defamiliarisation working most effectively. Traits that might have been taken for granted had the protagonist been a boy‚Äîautonomy, competence, and ability to plan‚Äîare freshly highlighted through Kiki‚Äôs femininity to create a memorable coming-of-age story.‚Äù (Napier 2001, pp. 132-133).\n It is precisely this process of defamiliarsation ‚Äî through obfuscation of place, time and culture ‚Äî that allows Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service to play in service of its story and its spaces. Relevant to spatiality, the coastal city of Koriko is part of a recurring interest (and quite possibly, a fascination) on the part of Miyazaki for a mythologised ‚Äòold Europe‚Äô. This point was made by Chris Wood, who described Ghibli‚Äôs Europe in Porco Rosso as an object of a ‚Äútourist‚Äôs gaze,‚Äù and argued for such depictions to be understood as part of longtime Japanese wonder and apprehension towards the European powers (Wood 2008, pp.114-120).\nFig. 2.2 News footage shows the zeppelin losing anchor, mimicking footage of the Hindenburg  Nonetheless, although Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service depicts a much broader and typically complicated society than My Neighbour Totoro, it is less political overall. That it is not to say the film is apolitical, or lacking in textual complexity ‚Äî I would argue that all of Miyazaki‚Äôs films are deeply political, and characterise a moral and structural richness that is unsurpassed in contemporary anime. It is simply that, in the case of Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service, the questions asked of this ‚Äòalternate vision of history‚Äô are different to the interrogative, structural dialectic within My Neighbour Totoro. Where Totoro challenges foundational assumptions about Japanese historicism, affluence, technology and modernity, Kiki‚Äôs Koriko is a wholly more fantastical glimpse into a blossoming, affluent Euro-themed society left intact in a depiction that recalls William Morris‚Äôs ‚ÄúEpoch of Rest‚Äù. In both cases, acknowledging these film spaces are extrapolated from our own global history ‚Äî the Second World War looms large. Emerging like a phantom, it raises questions about artefacts that appear in these films that otherwise were radically altered by the turbulence of the early 20th century. In Totoro, it is agrarian pastoralism in a pre-Sh≈çwa society. In Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service, it is the splendour of a zeppelin, the romantic mythos of romantic European society, and the sanctity of technology as a servant of peacetime.\nA.J. Rocca argues for Koriko as a foundation for the climax of the film ‚Äî a resounding ‚Äòwhat-if‚Äô rejection of the ‚Äúghost of modernity‚Äù:\n ‚Äú[In Koriko] food and goods are plentiful, there‚Äôs no trace of any deep social antagonisms, and new technologies like the Zeppelin and biplane are presented as whimsical machines full of novelty and wonder as opposed to weapons of war. Koriko is nothing less than a utopia, and more: it‚Äôs a modern utopia; an idealised picture of what the 20th century might have looked like in the dreams of a Bellamy or a Chernyshevsky.‚Äù (A.J. Rocca, 2017)\n Fig. 2.3 Crowds gather on Koriko‚Äôs rooftops to watch the stricken zeppelin  The film guides the setting into the same climax it does its protagonist, Kiki. As Kiki discards self-doubt and reacquires her agency as a witch to save her friend, Tombo, a whole pre-war era is backed into that moment and held hostage. Rocca notes that, as the dirigible is wrested from human control, a reporter exclaims phrases pulled from the real-world Hindenburg disaster. It is in this moment, followed by the conclusion of the film in which no-one was hurt, that Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service marks a fantastical departure from our own timeline ‚Äî one that would, after the Hindenburg disaster, result in the bloodshed of the Second World War, and the iron curtain, depression and austerity that followed it. Out of Ghibli‚Äôs catalogue, Koriko is perhaps the most explicitly visionary in its depiction of alternate and parallel timelines\nConsolidating the spatial turn of both Totoro and Kiki, linked in this argument by their mutual depictions of ‚Äòlost pasts,‚Äô is the universalising power of reigning in the ‚Äòfantastical‚Äô (i.e. witches and forest spirits) with utopian thinking, drawn from the real world. This fascination with the interplay of the fantastic and the mundane extends well beyond the story of our girl protagonists ‚Äî it is reproduced throughout these worlds, colliding their real-world contexts with nostalgic whimsy resurrected by proxy through the studio‚Äôs more fantastic elements ‚Äî forest trolls and flying broomsticks. This is how a village amidst Japan‚Äôs great economic miracle, a time dominated by urbanisation, deforestation and consumerism, is resurrected in My Neighbour Totoro as a sort of utopian ‚Äòno-place,‚Äô colliding pre-Meiji intuition (Karatani 1993) with telephones and trolley cars. Similarly, this is how a European seaside town, fresh out of the First World War and awaiting a brutal resurgence of violence in the ‚ÄòAge of Frustration4,‚Äô is resurrected in Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service as a tranquil old-world theatre of European architecture, home to zeppelins and witches alike. Alternative histories are not simply spaces of the past, but in fact vessels of the present recreated elsewhere; displaced and transcendent. That is how Studio Ghibli reproduces conventional space in a utopian fashion.\n2. Interiority and Reproduction Memory and Agrarianism in Only Yesterday T here is perhaps no finer testament to the specialness of the films of Studio Ghibli and Isao Takahata than 1991‚Äôs Only Yesterday. It is a film unique in the landscape of animated cinema. It is a sensitive depiction of womanhood in Japanese society, filled with muddy emotion and bittersweet moods usually reserved for live action feature films. Only Yesterday is strikingly empathetic and restrained in its representation of all parts of protagonist Taeko‚Äôs life. The people of her memories are complex, and her recollections of childhood are joyful, curious, mundane and occasionally heartbreaking. This is a film that could not exist in the mainstream animation culture of the U.S., but in Japan it was the highest-grossing domestic film of 1991. A film that typifies of Takahata‚Äôs experimental oeuvre, Only Yesterday forces the casual viewer to reassess assumptions about what sort of stories animation is able to tell. It is delicate, contemplative and nostalgic in a medium dominated by films that are usually exhilarating, fantastic and whimsical. This approach creates unique landscapes previously undiscussed in Ghibli‚Äôs cinema catalogue, and so argument for their relevance will be made here. This includes multidimensional spaces that are included in the themes of the film as well as more literally in Takahata‚Äôs approach to filmmaking itself. There obvious contrasts in the film ‚Äî between agrarian and urban living, and memory and the present, each of which develop their own rich spaces. Takahata‚Äôs pioneering approach towards the actual mechanisms of Japanese animation push this analysis further, however ‚Äî and we‚Äôll have a look at the creative ways he illustrates these worlds.\nOnly Yesterday introduces Tokyo office worker Taeko, a woman in her late twenties about to embark for the countryside, where she explains to a friend that she‚Äôll ‚Äúvisit family,‚Äù ‚Äî in reality, though a tenuous familial connection exists, Taeko uses her time in the rural countryside to get away from city life and participate in the safflower harvests in Yamagata. On the train ride there, she finds herself surrounded by memories of childhood. After her arrival in Yamagata, she is picked up by a second cousin of an in-law, Toshio, with whom she is barely acquainted. Her displacement and sudden nostalgia allow bitter questions to emerge ‚Äî at 27 years old, has Taeko been true to the dreams of her 10-year-old self? What would her childhood self think of her now? As she participates in rural life, and learns more about Toshio, the film pirouettes between self-contained scenes and images of her childhood and the present, sometimes contrasting them, sometimes merely observing a memory. A tapestry of topics ‚Äî travel, school, puberty, menstruation, puppy love, family and dreams are recalled in lyrical glimpses of the past, some of which caused distributors to regard the film as ‚Äúundubbable‚Äù (i.e., redistribute the film with the characters speaking English, performed by an English cast). Producer Geoffrey Wexler observed:\n ‚ÄúWhen I joined Ghibli and I talked to them I said, ‚ÄúAre you guys ever going to release this?‚Äù and they said, ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt release it.‚Äù I said, \u0026ldquo;Can it have it back then?\u0026rdquo; and they said, ‚ÄùYes.‚Äù I think the discussion of the girls having their periods may have been a problem. A lot of people squirm about that in North America, but in other countries they don‚Äôt. It wasn‚Äôt a problem in some countries. I think also the pacing was hard for North America‚Äù (Aguilar, 2016).\n Fig. 3.1 Young Taeko sits out of PE after catching a cold, worried her peers will think she‚Äôs on her period  These memories, broadly depicting different aspects of childhood (or, for that matter, linear), offer a unique unsentimental glimpse of middle-class girlhood in postwar Japan. It is only appropriate that these memories resurface during Taeko‚Äôs own physical displacement, since the transition between her urban and agrarian identities offer ample room for dislocated reflection in the spaces between. They reflect what could be described as an ‚Äòabstract temporality‚Äô in the absence of mapped space ‚Äî it is here that we see linear chronology in the film begin to break down, as does the world beyond, and for a moment the past and present intermingle freely in the train carriage. New places have us recalling and relying on a dialogue with past memory and the future. On a slow-moving sleeper train into Japan‚Äôs mountainous interior, having left city life behind and having not yet arrived at her destination, Taeko experiences this dislocation of time, and so memories of her youth emerge uncontrollably throughout the film. It is not simply that Taeko is daydreaming deliberately ‚Äî in several scenes, a memory bursts into her consciousness, triggered by spaces around her. It is a powerful depiction of how emotion and memory is bound to places, shapes, and images, and how those things can reemerge in their depiction.\nOnly Yesterday is a film about the ‚Äòspaces between,‚Äô formed in a collision of landscapes. Memory is perhaps at the heart of the spatial concerns of the film. The Japanese title, Memories Come Tumbling Down (Omoide Poro Poro) is perhaps a better summation of the events of the film, since the themes of the work and Takahata‚Äôs filmmaking rely so heavily on the interplay between past and present here. They are visually distinguished through changes in style of both backgrounds and character cels. When Taeko recalls a moment from her childhood, Takahata strips our sense of place right back. What follows is a beautiful representation of the foreignness and inaccessibility of childhood memories, depicted masterfully in gentle watercolour strokes and liquid shapes. These scenes look almost like traditional Japanese paintings, employing artful negative space and desaturated tones to direct attention and emphasise detail. The environment of Taeko‚Äôs childhood looks almost half-finished, invoking the haze of memory and her bias towards her own presence. It is not merely a depiction of absence, but is used to emphasise the vitality of the memory, by depicting honestly the events as Taeko remembers them.\nMore subtle, however, is Takahata‚Äôs unusual shift in the style of characters themselves. In the scenes of the present day, features of the face like cheeks and smile lines are animated in a noticeable and sharp break from anime‚Äôs tradition of simplification. In childhood, however, these illustrations disappear, where wide, plastic faces conform to Ghibli‚Äôs established style. This is both an artefact of Takahata‚Äôs experimentation with animating around prerecorded lines (a practice unusual for anime, where actors usually perform after production is underway), and a stylistic distinction that emphasises the schism between Taeko‚Äôs nostalgic Shoujo world and the real ‚Äòpresent‚Äô (Campbell, 2020). This is surely deliberate, since young Taeko represents well the common features of Ghibli heroines, regarded in Japan as ‚ÄòShoujo‚Äô, literally ‚Äòyoung lady‚Äô or ‚Äòlittle girl‚Äô. This characterisation, described by Tamae Prindle (1998) as a ‚Äúlacuna between adulthood and childhood, power and powerlessness, awareness and innocence as well as masculinity and femininity‚Äù is a common trope, but although commonly depicted across Ghibli‚Äôs catalogue it alone does not fully summate the depth and complexities of their protagonists. Young Taeko reflects the shoujo idea specifically in a scene in which she dreams of becoming an actress ‚Äî in the memory, her eyes are larger and exaggerated in typical shoujo manga style, in her mind ‚Äúacting out‚Äù the exaggerated beauty and proportions of the shoujo trope. In this sense, there is a clear spatial distinction between the naturalistic styles and illustration of the present and the malleability of dreams and their abstract temporality.\nFig. 3.2 Taeko and her host family dry saffron on straw mats in the sun  The division of landscapes is not unique to the mechanics of cinema, however ‚Äî Only Yesterday has sincere thematic spaces also. By this point in the argument of this thesis, Ghibli‚Äôs interest and dialogue with natural landscape and the environment is well established. Unlike the functional and artistic implications of space, the ‚Äòworlds‚Äô of Only Yesterday do not invoke specific personal memory but broader historical contexts, largely informed by the social upheaval and rapid introduction of consumer society in the Sh≈çwa period, albeit through a very different lens than that of My Neighbour Totoro. We see the introduction of nostalgia as informed by commodity-objects, including references to period-appropriate music groups and television. The inclusion of the series-0 Shinkansen, Japan‚Äôs first high-speed rail network, is symbolic of the postwar era, as a culmination of Japanese industrial strength and war recovery. Despite the film‚Äôs initial release in 1991, the story is set in the early 1980s, positioning Taeko as a child in the height of the baby boom and inextricably positioning her as a girl of Sh≈çwa. This acknowledgement is important, because it finds Taeko‚Äôs fascination and eventual adoption of an agrarian lifestyle uniquely within this historical Japanese period, and characterises her personal struggles against deeply cultural spaces. This functions alongside the playful past-present mechanic, widening the cultural and technical gap between childhood and adulthood. On the overnight train trip out of Tokyo, Taeko sees little of the passing landscape and the audience experiences a dislocation of space, unable to map the journey without prior knowledge of her destination. In this sense, Sh≈çwa Tokyo is not just a memory but a physically alien world, segregated from her rural destination by an inscrutable journey between. Her childhood memory, and its legacy in Japan‚Äôs vicious urbanism, is divorced from the present twofold, and an inversion of topos has occurred. The film shows little of present-day Tokyo, because there is little to tell ‚Äî to a Japanese audience in the 1990s, this constituted a ‚Äòdefault‚Äô space.\nThe same cannot be said for the depiction of Yamagata, and Taeko‚Äôs retreat to the country marks a visual departure as dramatic as that between the memory scenes and present Tokyo. Despite her stay in a thoroughly Japanese farmhouse amidst steep, terraced hills, European elements also emerge. Toshio, her acquaintance and friend, mentions an affection for traditional Eastern European music, and agriculture in the region is dependent on the harvesting of Saffron flowers, an originally mediterranean crop. This reflects, to some extent, the minor Japanese interest in ‚ÄòOld Europe,‚Äô but also helps distinguish Taeko‚Äôs journey as somewhat special across Japanese agriculture, distinguish the practice and technique of Saffron harvest against staple crops like rice. We see every part of the plant being used, using its valuable threads to dye clothes. Here, Taeko is obviously an outsider ‚Äî despite her eagerness to learn and participate ‚Äî and so her Sh≈çwa nostalgia, which she confesses to Toshio, is unreciprocated. This ties into a broader, studio-wide thematic interest here towards the deficiencies of Japanese urbanism. Most obviously, the previous chapter‚Äôs My Neighbour Totoro celebrates agrarian living, and it is not unreasonable to associate Only Yesterday with this general post-Sh≈çwa urban skepticism. The film makes obvious, however, that Taeko‚Äôs tentative agrarian retreat is presented as an alternative, rather than default space. It is very much a human domain, just distant from the bustling heart of Tokyo, which is epistemically opposed to Totoro‚Äôs more foundational absence of landscape.\nFig. 3.3 Young Taeko considers the poverty of a fellow classmate  Here we return to Karatani, who articulates the origins of this schism of conception:\n ‚ÄúOf course, I do not mean to say that landscapes and faces had not previously existed. But for them to be seen as \u0026ldquo;simply landscape\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;simply face\u0026rdquo; required, not a perceptual transformation, but an inversion of that topos which had privileged the conception landscape or face‚Äù (Karatani 1993, p. 56).\n In other words, it is precisely this conception of rural life that has alienated it, and so despite the similar Ghibli watercolour background style, they are totally different conceptions of ‚Äòagrarian living‚Äô. Miyazaki has said as much while discussing the Japanese relationship with nature:\n ‚ÄúThe biggest reason why mountain animals decreased so much is agriculture. It\u0026rsquo;s human arrogance to say that the country scenery is beautiful. A farm basically takes away the chance to grow from other plants. It\u0026rsquo;s more like barren land. The productivity of wasteland is higher than that of farmland. It\u0026rsquo;s the same for other creatures. It\u0026rsquo;s because of the time (we live in today) is such that I have to even think such things‚Äù (Miyazaki, 1997).\n In the context of this essay‚Äôs total argument, then, we see Only Yesterday advocate Ghibli‚Äôs spaces in two places ‚Äî first in memory, in the dichotomy of childish abstraction and mature naturalism, and then in physicality, in Ghibli‚Äôs environmentalist leitmotifs ‚Äî expressed commonly as a New Japan/Old Japan anxiety. Only Yesterday, like almost all of Takahata‚Äôs films, experiments with the format and style of animation to better express the function and mechanics of thematic or story concern, which marks a departure in the body of this thesis from Miyazaki‚Äôs unwavering orthodoxy to the Ghibli ‚Äúhouse style‚Äù. This affords him a pleasant abstraction, not just in Only Yesterday but across his filmography, that is not usually present in Miyazaki‚Äôs more fantastic, but literal, filmmaking. In a paper concerned with spaces and their representation, Takahata takes an artistic wrench to a cohesive characterisation to Ghibli‚Äôs spatiality, and films precluded from this argument, including the likes of Pom Poko and My Neighbours the Yamadas might threaten to collapse it entirely, outliers as they are. Only Yesterday, however, and his 1988 film Grave of the Fireflies (which this this paper will look at in the next section) represent novelistic filmmaking that expands the conventions of cinema, and critical to the concern of this essay, the methods in which the studio‚Äôs worlds are constructed and depicted\n3. Childhood and Historicism Love and Whimsy in Whisper of the Heart N ow far from the fantastical images of a ‚Äòlost past‚Äô in Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service and My Neighbour Totoro, we arrive in Whisper of the Heart at the urban heart of Tokyo in the midst of the Japan\u0026rsquo;s ‚ÄòLost Decade,‚Äô a setting close to home for the contemporaneous Japanese audience that saw it in cinemas in 1995. This section also marks an interesting shift in this paper\u0026rsquo;s textual analysis, from the imagined to the ‚Äòreal‚Äô: places that you can ostensibly identify upon a map and ‚Äî as demonstrated in this chapter ‚Äî visit for yourselves. In this chapter, we‚Äôll look at Ghibli‚Äôs depiction of time and childhood within spaces and dreams, and how they interact and play with the real world\nWhisper of the Heart introduces Shizuku, a fourteen-year-old junior high-schooler whose creative ambitions and creeping anxiety about what she wants out of the future have her listless as serious decisions about school and life approach. Her bookish habits spur a meet-cute with a boy in her year who initially annoys her, Seiji. From there, a story unfolds about creativity and self-discovery, positioning Shizuku as a burgeoning creative as her relationship with Seiji blossoms. She navigates the exceptions of herself from within and without, culminating in the draft of her first novel as her school exams loom.\nThe manga on which the film is based (of the same name) prioritises the relationship between Shizuku, Seiji, and a third fellow student as part of a love triangle common in Shojo manga. In Miyazaki‚Äôs hands, however, the film presents Shizuku as an independent spirit, following her heart on a journey of self-confidence and discovery alongside, rather than because of, Seiji. In the context of the severe recession underway in Japan at the time, their creative ambitions are strikingly brave, and describe a circumstance that was undoubtedly relevant to young Japanese contemplating their futures in 1995.\nWithin the film, however, the asset bubble and stock market crash couldn‚Äôt be further away, as a more domestic conflict within a middle-class family plays out. Shizuku‚Äôs parents are scholarly (a common trope within Ghibli‚Äôs catalogue) ‚Äî her father works at the local municipal library and her mother studies at university. Since her sister, with whom she shares a room for the first part of the film, is also a university student, Shizuku is a somewhat independent figure. It is possible that her bookishness is inherited at least in part from her parents. Her life is spread across Tama, commuting to and from school and her father‚Äôs library, as well as the commercial heart of her hometown. Hills are a characteristic feature of the area, and the film depicts curving roads, vast concrete retaining walls and steep staircases throughout.\nFig. 4.1 Shizuku crosses a curved street in Tamagawa   Fig. 4.2 The same curved street (own work)    Whisper of the Heart makes full use of the Tamagawa suburb in Tokyo, employing locations in all manner of spatial functions. Shizuku finds herself exploring parts of these hills, and we explore with her ‚Äî where conventional filmmaking intuition would merely cut between locations, Kond≈ç (and also screenwriter Hayao Miyazaki, who drafted the storyboards) use a practice common among Ghibli films in which the journey is presented in part or in full, allowing audiences to map recurring spaces in the film. These are thoroughly immersive journeys, with detailed views into the outside world as they whiz by on trains or on bicycles. Weedy (2018) calls this approach ‚Äúperceptual modulation,‚Äù and recalls Miyazaki‚Äôs invocation of Ma as its reason for being, arguing that:\n ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] it is the train-like motion of these animated vehicles that perceptually modulate the viewers. Their gaze is then focused on the character‚Äôs simple face, and the combination of these two elements creates this specific empathetic response resulting in characters that feel multidimensional, despite the flat, two-dimensional art style.‚Äù\n This approach also means most viewers will cultivate a basic understanding of Tamagawa ‚Äî and by extension, the anchors of Shizuku‚Äôs life ‚Äî through the relationship of these spaces with Shizuku and with each other. This approach also has a dramatic effect on the pacing of the film, which Miyazaki identified above as Ma in an interview with critic Roger Ebert. ‚ÄúEmptiness,‚Äù Miyazaki said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs there intentionally‚Äù (Ebert, 2002). He proceeds to distinguish it from Makurakotoba, or ‚Äúpillow words,‚Äù found in Japanese poetry, since Ma describes the ‚Äònegative space‚Äô or ‚Äòemptiness‚Äô of a scene, both physically and conceptually. In these contexts, the depiction of a journey ‚Äî consuming money and time to animate ‚Äî are clearly important parts of pacing and storytelling and help to provide breathing room between scenes. They also provide a physical dimension between locations, even if their specifics remain vague ‚Äî we might not know for how long the train runs, or which stations she boards and alights, but we understand that her home and the library are linked together by a short walk and a train trip. This map helps illustrate what should be an abstract, alien series of places by their relationship to each other and Shizuku, reorganising them spatially.\nFig. 4.3 Shizuku sits at a shrine after school with a friend   Fig. 4.4 The same shrine (own work)    The film is set in and inspired by Tamagawa ‚Äî centred on the Seiseki Sakuragaoka station on the Keio Line specifically ‚Äî and many locations depicted in the film are inspired by locations in this area. In this sense, there are two places that appear simultaneously in the film. To those that are familiar with the local area, the film faithfully recreates and depicts the landscape and architecture of Tamagawa, with all its local history ‚Äî from its origins in the rapid expansion of Tokyo suburbia in the ‚Äò60s, to its Keio line station and commercial surrounds. To those unfamiliar with Tamagawa, these places transcend their real-world origins and become fantasy, drawing more broadly on concepts of ‚Äòlife in Japan‚Äô. A foreigner may not recognise Shizuku‚Äôs Danchi as a postwar public housing initiative common to the Tokyo metro area, but they may very well recognise her apartment lifestyle and the concrete structure‚Äôs open-air staircase to be ‚ÄòJapanese.‚Äô In this sense, there is a Shizuku of Tamagawa, a Shizuku of Japan, and perhaps even Shizuku of universal adolescence, with the specificity of her environs and circumstance irrelevant to the broader narrative strokes of the film.\nIn typical Ghibli fashion, there is an obvious presence of this ‚Äòuniversal Shizuku,‚Äô even within this deeply Japanese film. Most obviously, there is mention of Seiji‚Äôs interest in a traditionally European craft (violin making) and his ambitions to study under an expert in Italy. More broadly, however, the recession that devastated Japan‚Äôs ‚Äòeconomic miracle‚Äô during production is replaced by broader gestures towards familial concern and adolescent uncertainty, requiring Shizuku to draw upon confidence in herself and her ability to justify her departure from the ‚Äúusual path‚Äù. She has noble and disarmingly charming literary ambitions in an education system that prioritises test-taking and academic performance, and weighing her dreams against family and society are at the heart of the themes of this film. Shizuku‚Äôs parents, while hesitant and concerned for her wellbeing, are supportive of her ambitions and largely defy stern, conservative Japanese stereotyping (Nakayama 2014, pp.17-19), allowing Shizuku‚Äôs circumstance to transcend Tamagawa and Japan. These are the ‚Äúshared cultural codes‚Äù described by Frans M√§yr√§ (2010, p. 38), who recognised Ghibli‚Äôs propensity to demonstrate ‚Äúcontemporary global concerns‚Äù that are ‚Äúreadily available as a cultural dialectic for the future.‚Äù\nFig. 4.5 A Keio EMU pulls into Seiseki-sakuragaoka station   Fig. 4.6 The same station (own work)    This is perhaps symbolised best by the film‚Äôs use of ‚ÄòCountry Roads‚Äô by John Denver, which is referenced throughout the film and finally sung during the climax of the film ‚Äî a concept which, to West Virginians, might seem delightfully absurd. Walter Chaw for Film Freak Central expressed this colourfully, writing in his review:\n ‚ÄúThe obsession with reworking John Denver\u0026rsquo;s hilljack schmaltz classic \u0026ldquo;Country Road\u0026rdquo; into an un-ironic ode to the \u0026ldquo;concrete roads\u0026rdquo; of the picture‚Äôs Tokyo-bound little girl protagonist, for instance, almost by itself renders Whisper of the Heart a Hello Kitty! for that particular brand of Japanese, Yank-ophile, cross-eyed badger shit‚Äù (Chaw, 2016).\n He adds, ‚Äú[the song] reminds us of how peculiar a beast cultural diffusion can be.‚Äù\nPerhaps, throughout the Ghibli catalogue, there is no better representation of how wildly different cultural spaces interact and fuse into new immersive experiences ‚Äî in the same way that Tamagawa for many Westerners is now illustrated by the beautiful watercolours of the film‚Äôs backgrounds, perhaps the song ‚ÄòCountry Roads‚Äô for Japanese audiences in 1995 recalls not American mountains but Japanese hills. This is whimsy at its finest, as a great equaliser ‚Äî and represents Ghibli‚Äôs ability to resonate internationally, even within films of real physical location. And it is precisely in this displacement of location and meaning that Whisper of the Heart reveals the importance of ‚Äòsubconscious cartography‚Äô in these worlds, especially in unfamiliar places.\nMortality and Innocence in Grave of the Fireflies G rave of the Fireflies originally released in Japan as a double feature, accompanying My Neighbour Totoro to cinemas. At first, this practice may strike someone familiar with both films as totally bizarre ‚Äî Grave of the Fireflies has been characterised as a Japanese ‚ÄúSchindler‚Äôs List‚Äù and My Neighbour Totoro is associated most commonly with wholesome, family cinema and came to define Ghibli‚Äôs universal nostalgia. In fact, the decision to play them back-to-back urged Phillip Wegner in part to theorise My Neighbour Totoro as an alternate history dream that contrasts the brutal naturalism of Grave of the Fireflies:\n ‚ÄúNot only did many of the same animators and production teams work on both films, there are a number of references throughout that suggest it and Totoro were intended to be understood as a complementary pair. For example, the lush visual representation of the countryside that the children inhabit for part of Grave of the Fireflies recalls the setting of Totoro; and at one point, the young protagonist Seita lies to his sister telling her that their mother ‚Äì who perishes after being severely burned in the attack on their city and whose ashes are in a can inside their meager cave-like dwelling ‚Äì is buried under a giant camphor tree‚Äù (Wegner, 2010).\n The film, directed by Takahata, is based off Nosaka Akiyuki‚Äôs short story of the same name. Nosaka is one of Japan‚Äôs great postwar novelists, and depicts the scene shown in the opening minutes of the film. Nosaka wrote Grave of the Fireflies in 1967, a month after his short story American Hijiki (a bitingly satirical post-war comedy), and Takahata‚Äôs 1988 film was its first cinema adaptation. In a 1994 interview (Animerica, p. 8) with Animerica magazine, Nosaka said:\n ‚ÄúThere were many offers to make that novel into a movie, but they never materialised. It was impossible to recreate the barren, scorched earth that‚Äôs to be the backdrop of the story [‚Ä¶] what if a kid with a fat belly showed up to play him [Seita]?‚Äù\n Fig. 5.1 The spirits of Seita and Setsuko overlook their aunt‚Äôs home after the firebombing of Kobe  Takahata further explained the rationale behind the animation war story in the same interview (p.7):\n ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs natural that many that many animated stories are adventure stories, and that‚Äôs not a bad thing in itself. But at the same time, I‚Äôve felt a contradiction in that‚Ä¶ Whether it‚Äôs animated or not, a wartime story tends to be moving and tear-jerking, but the young people reading or watching such a story have a certain inferiority complex in relationship to it. They think that people back then were much more noble and they wouldn‚Äôt be able to do such things themselves. But I think that‚Äôs not right. We make such stories to give people courage, but then the audience feels that the story has nothing to do with them. So I wanted a common ground for the audience to relate to. If felt that way before I encountered the [Nosaka‚Äôs] book.‚Äù\n The director confirms that, even in 1980s Japan, animation was associated mostly with adventure stories and children‚Äôs cartoons, making Grave a significant departure from the approach of prior formats (Animerica, 1994, pp.7-8). Yet its double-feature release alongside My Neighbour Totoro shows that Ghibli intended the film to be seen by children ‚Äî an unusual approach, to say the least. So what is found in Takahata‚Äôs sobering war story?\nGrave of the Fireflies opens in the Japanese city of Kobe in the aftermath of the Second World War. The opening scene depicts the starvation death of Seita, a teenage boy, in a train station where he joins his sister as a spirit. The film then cuts to the waning days of the war, as Seita‚Äôs mother and five-year-old sister, Setsuko, prepare to evacuate their home in anticipation of an air raid. Moments later, the bombs arrive but not in the expected form ‚Äî long, thin incendiary tubes land and set fire to their home and neighbourhood. As a firestorm grows and consumes the city, Seita and Setsuko seek shelter, having been separated from their mother. By the time the fire is extinguished, Kobe is scorched and barren ‚Äî little remains but Meiji stone department stores and concrete schools. Seeking shelter at a local elementary school, Seita is informed that his mother was badly burnt in the raids. Within days, he dies.\nWith their mother‚Äôs passing and their father overseas in the war, the children are taken in by distant family and relocate to the countryside. Seita sells his mother‚Äôs remaining possessions and retrieves their buried supplies, giving it all to his aunt, who uses the proceeds to purchase rations. As the supplies begin to stretch thin, and the number of mouths to feed in the home increases, his aunt becomes increasingly resentful towards their presence, since Seita has no job or income. This culminates in an argument that results in Seita and Setsuko setting out on their own, establishing themselves nearby in an empty bomb shelter that sits on the edge of a small lake.\nAt first, Seita and his sister are triumphant at their independence and freedom by the lake. A scene sees them capturing and releasing fireflies in their small, cave-like shelter, only for Setsuko to find them dead the next morning. She asks, ‚Äúwhy do fireflies have to die so soon?‚Äù As food becomes scarce, Seita provides for them by stealing from the fields of local farmers, who eventually catch him and assault him. Setsuko grows increasingly ill, and when Seita takes her to a doctor he confirms she is dangerously malnourished. Seita goes to withdraw the last of his mother‚Äôs money from her bank account, but on his way back to the shelter Japan has surrendered and, since her navy was sunk, his father is almost certainly dead.\nFig. 5.2 Setsuko watches enemy fighters buzz the Japanese coast  Satsuko is delirious by the time he returns, and although he attempts to feed her she passes soon after. A scene shows a wealthy family returning home from the country after evacuation, indulging in music and small-talk, as glimpses of Setsuko‚Äôs life in the shelter are shown. Seita cremates her body at the top of the hill, and retains only a few small personal items in her memory. He starves to death in the weeks following surrender, joining Setsuko‚Äôs spirit. In a haunting image, they settle beneath a view of modern-day Kobe, aglow in the prosperity of the postwar world.\nIt is unflinchingly tragic, but also in some ways more sentimental than Nosaka‚Äôs own experience, who survived his sister and died in 2015. As Takahata explained, Seita reflects a postwar generation, as ‚Äúhe withdraws to go away and do other things. He doesn‚Äôt endure it‚Äù (Animerica, 1991, p. 7). Takahata positions Grave not as a traditional anti-war film in its tragedy, despite his well-documented antiwar advocacy, in favour of an intimate story of the consanguineous bond of brother and sister, and their death in isolation. We recall here the ‚ÄúNew Japan/Old Japan‚Äù anxiety of the previous chapter on Only Yesterday, but its dimensions are replaced. ‚ÄòNew‚Äô and ‚ÄòOld‚Äô are not broad notions of old agrarian Japan and new consumer society, but of old childhood in the Second World War and new childhood raised after it. So there like a lot of Takahata‚Äôs films, Grave invokes a dialogue between the time of a film‚Äôs release and the time of a film‚Äôs setting.\nThis is why Goldberg (2009, p. 41) suggests the use of luminous fireflies as an image of ‚Äú[remembering] this wartime history paradoxically through the act of viewing the natural,‚Äù bridging the irreconcilable suffering of the war and consumer society shown at the end of the film through a natural paradigm. This is helped by the illustrative nature of animation ‚Äî the fireflies mirror closely the burning spot-fires of Tokyo, in the same way that our protagonists depict the idea of a brother and sister transcendentally, rather than literally as in live-action cinema. This produces an effect that paradoxically distills the brutality and tragedy of the film, immersing the audience in their feelings without distracting them with the detail of a living human actor. This better orients characters spatially, since they are depicted in the same transcendental approach given to background watercolour and lighting cels.\nFig. 5.3 Seita and Setsuko sitting in the sunset outside their makeshift shelter  To close the argument portion of this thesis, it seems appropriate to draw parallels between Grave and its sister film Totoro through Karatani‚Äôs initial observation on the upheaval of the old, transcendental understanding of landscape. It is easy enough to draw parallels between Grave‚Äôs retreat from society and Only Yesterday‚Äôs similar modern phobias. More critically, considering their cinema pairing, consider how aspects of Grave‚Äôs landscape mirrors Totoro‚Äôs own pleasure amidst the trees; particularly the scenes in which Satsuko plays and acts out adult chores around their abandoned shelter. Wegner (2010) also draws parallels between the shelter the natural world provides in Totoro, nurturing the girls, and Grave‚Äôs ‚Äúfully objectified mute landscape, [which] appears glacially indifferent to their suffering.‚Äù Their shelter sits on a lake, across from where large country houses look over the surrounding countryside. There is some fantasy at play here, between the misery and rationing of the Japanese society and the freedom and peacefulness of the shelter. Of course, the children never really escape from the war-world ‚Äî they become increasingly dependent on it, as Setsuko‚Äôs health deteriorates. These desperate scenes starkly contrast the peaceful and intuitive relationship between person, agriculture and wilderness depicted in Totoro, and constitutes a dystopia that inverts several the picturesque, utopian deconstructions of modernity argued for in this paper‚Äôs first chapter. This is a good way of demonstrating the complementary, rather than antagonistic nature of the utopia/dystopia paradigm: we can trace the ‚Äòsocial dream‚Äô in both, precisely because of their opposing thematic constructions ‚Äî dystopia is most commonly an inversion, rather than a subversion, of the utopian social dream (Wegner 2002). The dream may be different ‚Äî Takahata clearly outlines a dialogue between the youth of consumer society and the abstract suffering of the war years at the beginning of this chapter ‚Äî but as a double-feature, and as a text preceding Totoro‚Äôs ‚Äò50s pacifism, Grave‚Äôs haunting echoes of the past reflect a radically different visions of Japan\u0026rsquo;s 20th-century landscape.\n4. Conclusion A lthough the five films pulled from Studio Ghibli‚Äôs thirty-year ‚Äúgolden age‚Äù might seem to constitute a varied selection of cinema, reflection on the arguments made across the five texts suggest their appropriateness for use here as elements of a single argument ‚Äî what components of Ghibli‚Äôs spatiality contribute to its importance in ongoing analysis into animation? Each film offers a unique dimension of spatial thinking, and helps build a portfolio of texts that testify Ghibli‚Äôs strength in depicting and moving around landscapes.\nHence the title of this paper: A Universal Nostalgia ‚Äî ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù by way of the mechanics of Ghibli spatiality. Throughout this broad filmography there are recurring political themes (in perhaps the most obvious framing of utopian thinking), but we can also see utopian effort arising from the mechanics of the studio too. This is how hyperlocal texts like Only Yesterday, in its midcentury parade of Japanese memory, and Whisper of the Heart, in its championing of urban Tokyo spaces, can become universalised to audiences foreign to both Japanese urbanism and the Sh≈çwa/lost decade periods. The arguments of this thesis are less concerned with the spatial characteristics of any single film than it is with how different strengths of different films across Ghibli‚Äôs catalogue can make a convincing argument for the studio‚Äôs relevance and usefulness in both the structural and textual dialogue around animation. This made a good excuse to revisit and assess some of the studio‚Äôs most memorable, and often less-discussed, works across the last forty years and map them against their spatial strengths to produce a convincing portfolio of utopian spatiality.\nThe first section of this thesis, titled Spatiality and Abstraction, looked at two of Ghibli‚Äôs ‚Äòlost histories,‚Äô or films that depict alternative pasts in the real world. These films constitute the most fantastical among the texts analysed in this thesis. Miyazaki‚Äôs My Neighbour Totoro, represents the heart and initial inspiration of this thesis, because of its obvious agrarian whimsy and Wegner‚Äôs (2010) powerful argument for its understanding as alt-history. It introduced a conversation about modernity we saw recurring throughout the subsequent chapters, but positions itself more generally, depicting an ‚Äòalternate Sh≈çwa‚Äô that could very well be an ‚Äòalternate agrarian Britain‚Äô or ‚Äòalternate postwar Europe;‚Äô highlighting the some of the similarities and many of the vast differences between Japan‚Äôs war period and that of the pre-war West. This is Ghibli at its most subversive, due to its restrained depiction of utopian agrarian life and the small-worldness of childhood. It presents utopia as a conceptual dream, rather than as dry political fiction, which is made powerful by its gentle abstraction and pastoral universality. Although other Ghibli films indict and critique real places and times in history, none do it as quietly and convincingly as Totoro.\nMy Neighbour Totoro‚Äôs ‚Äòabstract Japan‚Äô is followed by an ‚Äòabstract Europe‚Äô in Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service, the subject of the second chapter. As siblings of the Spatiality and Abstraction section, Kiki‚Äôs urban European port town is closer to Totoro‚Äôs agrarian Japan than it first appears, largely bound by their mutual fascination with and deliberate recreation of the midcentury period in their respective landscapes. Where Wegner saw a 20th-century vision of Japan that had never gone to war in Totoro (2010), A.J. Rocca saw a ‚Äúghost of modernity‚Äù in Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service (2017), that, similarly, had survived into the postwar period only through the abolition of the Second World War itself. This leaves the section with two key arguments, drawn from analysis of each chapter. First, that Ghibli films (as directed by Miyazaki) show a fascination with the rebuilding of history, reinventing and immersing old spaces and building out of them ‚Äòghost pasts‚Äô that never occurred in our own world. Looking backwards from the 21st century, these ‚Äòghost pasts‚Äô are depicted in the abstract, told only through local stories of local significance, lending them a vague universality that traditional science fiction often dismantles. It is precisely this abstraction, and the deeply human and empathetic depiction of our girl protagonists, that allows these places to live on as believable worlds in our minds.\nThe second section section documented Interiority and Reproduction, and accompanied a focus on personhood and placeable nostalgia in Takahata‚Äôs Only Yesterday. The film introduced the same fitful postwar setting of My Neighbour Totoro, but evidently the two films couldn‚Äôt be more distinct in scope and landscape. Only Yesterday‚Äôs bittersweet, chaotic memories of urban life in Tokyo are worlds apart from Totoro‚Äôs friendly agriculture, and Only Yesterday introduces this schism quite literally through protagonist Taeko‚Äôs split life between modern, the busy world of the city and agricultural, slow-paced worlds of the country. Only Yesterday has a playful relationship with linearity, dispensing it and recalling it at-will to better illustrate a portrait of its protagonist, which contributes another dimension to the spaces of the film. We see the camera observe child Taeko and adult Taeko independently, only for the two to coalesce into surreal moments of coexistence, as Taeko approaches truths about her dreams and the past. This section is dominated by a concern for spatiotemporality as it links to objects, invoking historical landscapes to ground memory and place. In Only Yesterday, this is demonstrated in the cultural artefacts of growing up, or the depiction of the new Shinkansen bullet train, which helps to ground the studio‚Äôs backwards-facing storytelling in the ‚Äòreal,‚Äô thus demonstrating Ghibli‚Äôs capacity for open dialogue with the spaces of the past even among a catalogue of successful abstract films.\nThe final section, Childhood and Historicism, looked at two films produced contemporaneously in conversation with the time in which they were produced and the circumstances that produced them. The chapter is also an indulgence of the depiction of childhood, a common trope of the studio, in which two vastly different stories produce antithetical concepts of the ‚ÄòChild‚Äô. Whisper of the Heart is easily argued as an anthem for beleaguered recession-culture youth, with its creative and curious teenage protagonist Shizuku holding faith in her ability amidst the collapse of Japan‚Äôs ‚Äòeconomic miracle‚Äô. This chapter looked at the modality of literary cartography, in which the depiction of travel allows audiences to map places against each other, and the multidimensionality of real space and how that space is recognised and valued. Shizuku is a teenager of ‚Äòmultiple Tamagawas,‚Äô in the sense that her lifestyle and life-spaces are reproduced in different forms to different audience-members, a universality that recurs throughout the films depicted here. This depiction of recession-childhood was followed by Takahata‚Äôs tragic war-childhood in Grave of the Fireflies, which expanded on Ghibli‚Äôs propensity for conversation on Japanese historicism and modernity, and provided (through its adjacency to Totoro) another glimpse of a ‚Äòsocial dream‚Äô recalled throughout this paper in various capacities.\nReflecting on the subject of this paper, a few simple truths of the Ghibli catalogue emerge from the sum of each of the five texts. The first, and perhaps most overt, is that these films (which include works directed by all three co-founders of the animation studio) are deeply concerned with time and place, and contribute to contemporary conversation about animation and filmmaking through their varied depiction of modern history. This contributed on several occasions to politicised spatiotemporality, often in utopian form (as ‚Äòalt-history‚Äô or ‚Äòlost-history,‚Äô in addition to literalist depictions of Japanese experiences throughout the 20th century).\nCritically to the focus of this thesis, however, it is clear that while Ghibli maintains a ‚Äòhouse style‚Äô of hand-drawn character cels and detailed watercolour background plates, the studio also maintains a ‚Äòspatial dimension‚Äô to its films, constructed out of recurring stylistic artefacts that have come to characterise the studio‚Äôs look. This means that, modality and perception aside, there is a spatial foundation working across the studio‚Äôs films that transforms all landscapes depicted, rendering all works in the same visual language. This is important, because the transcendental quality of animation produces startling capacity for storytelling, and is how the same studio, with many of the same artists, can produce magical films like Totoro and realist character portraits like Only Yesterday within years of each other. That ‚Äòsame visual language‚Äô is a key concept in Ghibli‚Äôs total spatial turn, because it operates like a language ‚Äî perhaps not a phonetic alphabet, but pictographically, and transcendentally of what it‚Äôs actually depicting. In the same way sounds and icons come to represent concepts and phrases, Ghibli‚Äôs large heads and plastic mouths come to represent people. By Karatani‚Äôs metrics (1993), that transcendental style affords the studio a valuable literary freedom, not bound by the realist constraints of description or live cinema.\nLooking specifically to the components of Ghibli‚Äôs spatial turn, then, we see a broad tapestry of film that experiments with space-making beyond the inherent abstractions of the medium. Throughout the analysis of this thesis, the films depicted here reveal startling multidimensional geography, rearranging historical timelines and identifiable cultural aesthetics into new forms (as in My Neighbour Totoro and Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service), recalling foreign temporal dimensions and memory (as in Only Yesterday), and the recreation of real place and real history through abstracted forms (as in Whisper of the Heart and Grave of the Fireflies respectively). This adds up to a complex and sophisticated spatial catalogue, and suggests that broader generic trends within anime could similarly provide historical, cultural and textual insight into the narrow dialectic of literary cartographic discourse, and provide new ground for Ghibli fans to explore novel and sophisticated dimensions in the studio‚Äôs work.\nI think that this is among the studio‚Äôs greatest strengths as an animation studio, in a medium that by its nature celebrates landscape. There is nothing left to chance in animation; everything must be built. In this sense, it represents an outstanding medium for social dreaming; a vicarious celebration of architecture, nature, infrastructure and domesticity ‚Äî the places that are the building blocks of ‚Äòsocial dreams‚Äô. With Ghibli, we see this repeatedly. We see it in the abstract, as whimsical alt-history and domestic play-fantasies within fictitious, beautifully-created watercolour landscapes. We see it in the interiority of its characters, which break down temporality and use it to inject reflection and memory into literal space. We see it in the reproduction of historical settings used to communicate the atmosphere and iconography of previous ages, and retell the truths of their time. We see it in the way Ghibli‚Äôs spaces create transcendental images of the real world in ways that can universalise and beautify it, or to produce a dialogue with contemporary audiences and the past. These distinctive, sensitive and beautifully-depicted spaces are, for me, a significant component of the total value of Studio Ghibli‚Äôs body of work, and demonstrate the importance of animated stories not just as beautiful pictures, but immersive living spaces that affect the modality and linearity of filmmaking. This intersection of world-making, illustration and the mechanisms of film is unique to animation, and Studio Ghibli provides new and rich insights into this emerging spatial conversation across several overlapping disciplines. This represents an exciting dialogue for the future of animation study, and the multiple spatial dimensions of Studio Ghibli‚Äôs filmography represent a unique and deeply engaging contribution to animated cinema.\nCited Works Filmography Grave of the Fireflies (1988).

It is named after Holsyim, its largest population centre. The town of Holsyim borders the Holsyim lo Kronaismioudelfia (Holsyim Crown Land), an isolated natural and spiritual preserve home to some of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s oldest temperate rainforests. It is also a popular resort town, and receives many domestic tourists each year.\nHistory Holsyim was founded as a fishing village in the late 19th century, but it\u0026rsquo;s likely that it was inhabited for many hundreds of years before that in smaller, undocumented settlements. The emergence of a new volcanic islet in 1942 was first reported by residents of the nearby village of Spisek, now known as Little Island. The town of Holsyim is home to an annual nude swim each winter.\nGeography Holsyim is well known for its adjacency to the Holsyim Crown Land, a preserved area of temperate rainforest that hosts thousands of different species of plants, animals and mosses. As Crown Land, it remains undeveloped and officially unrecognised by the Vekllei government, but nonetheless is documented extensively by local ecologists.

What is this project? Utopia has a lot of definitions, but in the end it\u0026rsquo;s about what it feels like. It has to be personal, otherwise it isn\u0026rsquo;t all that different from sci-fi. So utopia is about what feels right by the metrics of one person; an expression of worldview.  V ekllei is supposed to be an \u0026lsquo;epoch of rest\u0026rsquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s a project that\u0026rsquo;s become very big, with a long storyline and lots of characters, but at its heart this world is about peaceful escapism and whimsical nostalgia. This is a land of both plenty and pleasure, filled with the good and bad things of life, telling stories from a better place than our own.\nAlthough a comic is on the way soon, for now Vekllei exists in snippets through self-contained posts, which you can find at the Archive. This site also serves as a repository and archive for information about Vekllei.\nVekllei is a \u0026lsquo;worldbuilding\u0026rsquo; project, which means it doesn\u0026rsquo;t always look like a traditional storytelling endeavour. It introduces parts of an imaginary place that might not be revealed in a traditional linear story.\nVekllei is also a \u0026lsquo;utopian\u0026rsquo; project, which means that it\u0026rsquo;s a form of social dreaming. It\u0026rsquo;s a fantasy built out of the stresses and problems of the present, and so even if Vekllei people might not talk like you or look like you, there\u0026rsquo;s a chance some part of this world may feel like you do.\nThis means that all sorts of themes and influences show up in my work. Vekllei has the language of French-Chinese spoken with an Australian accent, a native people of mixed Inuit-Scandinavian descent, and a modern industrial society that\u0026rsquo;s going backwards.\nProject Fact Sheet  This place is iterative \u0026ndash; canon disappears, people change appearance and the systems of Vekllei twist and turn as I do. This place is good-spirited \u0026ndash; Vekllei is escapism, and although the dark accompanies the light, this project is supposed to be calming and fun. This place is constantly expanding \u0026ndash; I try out new styles, mediums and methods of distribution all the time. Some of them work, some of them don\u0026rsquo;t. I\u0026rsquo;m looking to start a comic and make an animated trailer for the project, so stay tuned for that!    2. Three Utopias Vekllei is place, but it\u0026rsquo;s also a people, created by Hobart. In this sense, there are three utopias in this project, along which posts are categorised.\n Author \u0026ndash; essays, reflection and discussion Landscape \u0026ndash; guides, diagrams and analysis Character \u0026ndash; stories, moments and memories  So what does \u0026lsquo;utopia\u0026rsquo; mean? It‚Äôs latin for ‚Äúno place‚Äù. It\u0026rsquo;s a forgotten history, a missed opportunity \u0026ndash; a perfect place to escape to. It\u0026rsquo;s a dream facing our past.\nVekllei is a very good place to live, but it is not perfect. Although many utopias are presented as perfect Edens of Earth, Vekllei is utopie concret√©. It is a dirty utopia full of the inconveniences, inefficiencies and heartbreak of reality. The idea of my utopia, then, is to settle the bad things of life in a beautiful framework.\nUtopia is a form of social dreaming, much like worldbuilding, linked to the values and priorities of its author. In utopian studies, ‚Äúutopia‚Äù is usually broken down further:\n Eutopia ‚Äî ‚Äúgood place‚Äù Dystopia ‚Äî ‚Äúbad place‚Äù  Note that both form a part of the ‚Äúutopia‚Äù ‚Äî this is appropriate, since Vekllei is grounded in a social realism that acknowledges the good and bad parts of life. Indeed, they are inseparable ‚Äî you cannot have the light without the dark. Such is the internal contradiction of any good utopia.\nUtopia as Author Utopias as Author refers to the fact that all utopias are deeply personal; they\u0026rsquo;re as intimate as dreams. There is no \u0026lsquo;author proxy\u0026rsquo; here because the whole thing is a proxy of authorship; an expression of individual experience and memory. Is it self-indulgent? Almost certainly. But if art is expression, why should dreams be excluded?    Utopia as Landscape Utopias of landscape (the topos) are the stuff you traditionally associate with the utopian tradition \u0026ndash; these are utopias of place. They include utopian cities, states, economies, machines, and any part of local physicality. When I talk about landscape, I use it in one of two ways.\n Landscape as it refers to physical space, like cities, woodlands and oceans. Landscape as it refers to the human metaphysic of place \u0026ndash; the way we build and identify physical spaces in our mind. For example, most people today distinguish between \u0026lsquo;the city\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;nature\u0026rsquo;. In Vekllei, they don\u0026rsquo;t.     Utopia as Character Utopias of character are what I call utopian premises of life experience; stuff you can\u0026rsquo;t construct from stone and concrete. Character utopias make up for the limitations of utopian space by recognising and providing for a new utopian dimension \u0026ndash; people, and personality. If the obsessive utopian can create imaginary communities from social dreams, why not people? Character utopias sum up an ideal life experience, personality, body and taste. Zelda is one such character utopia.    3. Where to from here? My little \u0026lsquo;epoch of rest\u0026rsquo; is pretty much the only thing I enjoy doing. It\u0026rsquo;s the melting pot of my whole life experience \u0026ndash; from interest and hobbyism to ideology and insecurity. It\u0026rsquo;s the sum of a worldview, a whole person, and to that end I think utopia is a powerful form of self-expression.\nI plan to tell lots of stories in Vekllei in lots of different ways. This wiki is one of them \u0026ndash; it allows me to fill out the world in a new format that better catalogues the scope of this project.\nI also plan to start work on a comic in late October 2020, and in 2021 I intent to produce a short animated trailer for the project. You can follow me along on these adventures on my Discord or the Vekllei subreddit.\nThank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy this adventure in dreaming.\n 4. F.A.Q. Let\u0026rsquo;s run through some frequently asked questions and common misconceptions about the project.\nWho are you?\nA Tasmanian illustrator.\nYou‚Äôre not Japanese?\n„ÅäÂâç„ÅØ„ÇÇ„ÅÜÊ≠ª„Çì„Åß„ÅÑ„Çã\nWhy is Vekllei a utopia?\nIt makes me feel better about my life and the world. It‚Äôs escapism; it‚Äôs a dream.\nIt‚Äôs a bit cringe to grandstand your political beliefs, doncha think?\nVekllei is a personal utopia. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm selling. At least you‚Äôre getting good opinions.\nWhere‚Äôs the tension if it‚Äôs perfect?\nVekllei is very cynical and tragic in places. Utopia is just a reflection of the author, good and bad.\nIs there a novel? A story? A comic?\nI‚Äôm working on a comic right now. I‚Äôm pretty much working on Vekllei full-time so I‚Äôm hoping to announce it soon. I‚Äôve got a lot of different Vekllei projects going.\nWhere is Vekllei?\nIceland.\nWhy does Vekllei look Japanese?\nVekllei is like a country of Scandinavians speaking French with an Aussie accent in Sh≈çwa era Japan/Maoist China/Taiwan etc. Vekllei looks however I imagine utopia looks.\nHow does that make sense?\nWhy can‚Äôt it just be cool?\nIs your alt-history thought out?\nVekllei‚Äôs history is whatever I need it to be. I‚Äôm always trying to be realistic, but it‚Äôs all worked backwards from the setting. I‚Äôm not really ‚Äúworldbuilding‚Äù in a typical sense. Very little of it is published, most of it is retrieved on request. Just ask if you have questions.\nWhy does Vekllei call itself ‚Äúpetticoat socialist‚Äù?\nVekllei is set in a culture of Marxist revivalism in the 50s and 60s. A lot of Vekllei‚Äôs lexicon is set in that context. Vekllei is a decentralised democracy that doesn‚Äôt use money. It‚Äôs a sort of participatory economy. It\u0026rsquo;s almost anarchic in that sense.\nWhy the \u0026ldquo;petticoat\u0026rdquo;?\nVekllei is a female country. Womanhood is decommodified. It\u0026rsquo;s maternal, social and friendly where progressive utopian rhetoric is masculine, technocratic and historicist.\nWho is Zelda?\nZelda is another name for Tzipora. She has two names specifically to confuse you.\nWhat is the ‚Äúbulletin‚Äù?\nI publish the Atlantic Bulletin once a month via email. It‚Äôs got the month‚Äôs posts in it as well as facts and tidbits from Vekllei. DM me an email if you want to join.\nJoin the Patreon.\nJoin the Discord.\nBe \u0026ldquo;petticoat\u0026rdquo;.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/drafts/archived/old-intro/","title":"Intro"},{"content":" /* flags */ .row { display: flex; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; } .column { flex: 33.33%; padding: 5px; } @media (max-width: 1250px) { .row { display: none; } } .gt-container { display: none; }  ﬂ∑ This article is about Hobart\u0026rsquo;s utopia, called Vekllei  What is this project? So this is Utopia,\nIs it? Well ‚Äî I beg your pardon;\nI thought it was Hell. \u0026ndash; Max Beerbohm  Quick Links  What is this project? What is Vekllei? Frequently Asked Questions     M y stories are about good places and people. That\u0026rsquo;s the gist of it. Vekllei is a fictional country where I demonstrate good things by drawing and writing about them. It\u0026rsquo;s part-escapism, part-fantasy, and all good.\nThis website is a comprehensive archive and portal to everything I do.\n Utopia is for everything related to Vekllei, its world, and characters Newsdesk is for everything outside of it Posts is for the individual stories I write and draw regularly.  Vekllei is a jumble of very pure, obsessive instincts that are illustrated to make them look and feel real. I want to take purity seriously by considering its implications in the real world. Vekllei does not use money \u0026ndash; a very straightforward and fantastical idea. Of course, moneylessness has extraordinary implications, and to maintain the purity of the idea we have to work very hard.\nSimplicity is actually very complicated, and so Vekllei is very complicated to justify the simplicity. It\u0026rsquo;s filled with things I value and people I admire. You\u0026rsquo;ll find hundreds of posts and many articles on this site, and all of them are designed to make this place and its people feel real.\nJust a few things to keep in mind:\n This place is iterative \u0026ndash; canon disappears, people change appearance and the systems of Vekllei twist and turn as I do. This place is good-spirited \u0026ndash; Vekllei is escapism, and although the dark accompanies the light, this project is supposed to be escapist and fun. This place is constantly expanding \u0026ndash; I try out new styles, mediums and methods of distribution all the time. Some of them work, some of them don\u0026rsquo;t. That\u0026rsquo;s part of the fun of it!  Three Utopias ‚ùñ Check out the FAQ   I define the broad, general phenomenon of utopianism as social dreaming \u0026ndash; the dreams and nightmares that concern the ways in which groups of people arrange their lives and which usually envision a radically different society than the one in which the dreamers live. But not all are radical, for some people at any time dream of something basically familiar.\n \u0026ndash; Lyman Sargent1\nThis project has three parts. Each part is a little utopia, in the sense that it\u0026rsquo;s a dream of some kind, but they\u0026rsquo;re not quite the same.\n Utopia as Landscape \u0026ndash; the country of Vekllei, with its geography, architecture, aesthetics, society, and culture. Utopia as Character \u0026ndash; the people of Vekllei, as they represent, interrogate, and soothe aspects of myself and others. Utopia as Author \u0026ndash; me, and my motivations, failings, and journey as a storyteller and illustrator.  What is Vekllei? ‚ùñ Main article: Vekllei  V ekllei (pronounced \u0026lsquo;Veck-lie,\u0026rsquo; or /v∆êk.la…™/) is an island country set in what we know as Iceland. Vekllei is its own country, and does not look or feel like Iceland. It has unique cultures, ethnicites, and landscapes. It is an old country, having been settled for thousands of years by native Algic peoples and Scandinavians. It is also a new county, having suffered a nuclear attack at the beginning of the 21st Century which extinguished much of its old civil society.\n        The flags of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s independent territories.  By the mid-21st century, Vekllei has become a remarkable place. Quality of life is excellent and living there is unlike living anywhere else on Earth. The country is an ambitious expression of alternate modes of thinking, visible in every aspect of society, from its bizarre moneyless economy to its complicated cultural and religious metaphysics.\nQuick facts about Vekllei and the state of the world in the mid-21st Century.\n Vekllei takes place in a fictional retrofuture, where some technologies have advanced in different ways. Most computers in Vekllei are centralised as manufactured wetware, connected to via terminals. In this sense, they are both more and less advanced than contemporary personal computing. In other technologies, like aerospace, the world is undeniably more advanced. Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s future retains the cold war from the previous century. The U.S.S.R. stiill exists, as do emerging political divisions across Europe, Africa, South America and Asia. Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s future remains heavily influenced by midcentury modernist styles. Although Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s unique history has influenced its region for thousands of years, most major diversions from our own timeline occur shortly after the Second World War.

Contact melonkony@icloud.com for inquiries and eligibility (or through any other available contact). Currently 2 out of 4 are completed, with several others in various states of completion. They will be done by the end of June and printed in July. The Studio MillMint site is undergoing major renovations thanks to the contributions of Ben_R_R#2574, a longtime patron and friend of the project. Changes to the site will be announced as they come in this bulletin, the #lounge and Patreon. The Atlantic bulletin is launched. There will be twelve issues a year. They will feature content of interest to fans of the Petticoat Project. Hobart has his final assessment task due on the 12th of June. Post schedule may suffer leading up to this period. The Patreon has hit $80 a month. That‚Äôs an incredibly amount of interest and I‚Äôd like to thank all patrons for their financial support ‚Äî it helps keep the lights on and gives me hope that I can work full-time on the project some day.   II. Tzipora-watch May 5th is Tzipora‚Äôs birthday. She spends her birthday with Baron and Ayn; her friends are relegated to the day after.\n III. Vekllei Fact of the Month You might be aware of venrouive and senrouive property, which mark ‚Äòessential‚Äô and ‚Äòpersonal‚Äô business respectively, but there is also a rarely-used third classification called uousinasenrouive. This means, roughly, ‚Äúproperty-obligation‚Äù. These places require a physical obligation from their owners, usually a debt owed to the history of the place. For example, an apartment above a bakery would usually fall under such a category, since living there would require operation and maintenance of the business also. Uousinasenrouive are very common in Vekllei, and many older residences involve these work obligations.\n IV. The Bulletin Fission Cloud at Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s 50th Anniversary üìñ Published 31st May 2020 | Read here.\nIn an unprecedented event, during Vekllei‚Äôs 50th Sea Festival since Independence in 2065, an 8 kiloton fission bomb was sunk to a depth of 150 meters and detonated at midday. It was an incredible sight on a day so clear you could see the gentle curve of the earth where it met the horizon. A flash of light and a spray dome surged outwards into the quiet Atlantic, which was broken apart by plumes that formed a column of water that climbed high into the sky. The lateral plumes, the ‚Äúmushroom‚Äù, reached far across the horizon, forming thick clouds that would begin to rain into the sea. From the coast, fifteen kilometres away, a warm light bathed observers and was followed a moment later by a bang that deeply shook you and those around you. In this instance it seemed that the whole universe was their domain.\nThe plume would rise nearly 1,500 metres into the sky before falling away. It stayed that way for a while. Almost nobody moved for a long time after ‚Äî people stood on cars and tables. You could only recognise the scale and the feeling of the fission bomb by seeing it in person. It seemed incomprehensible, in the face of such a device, that wars could still be fought at all. What use is a battleship in the face of a cloud like that?\n Tzipora and Elise, covering the detonation for Lola 7th School‚Äôs student newspaper, found themselves not quite sure what to say. Elise wrote, captioning Tziproa‚Äôs photograph, ‚ÄúThe Independence bomb filled our sky with our sea for a half-hour on Sunday, and with it rose the thoughts of every person in attendance, who considered the awesome power now shouldered by each of us.‚Äù\n There was indeed some sense that they had contributed to the bomb, and that they had more at their disposal. Few would fly the planes to deliver them, and fewer still had the brains to develop them, but participating in a nuclear century contributed to, in some effect, a nuclear horizon.\n Hot Rain in the Arctic Circle üìñ Published 27th May 2020 | Read here.\nTzipora had been ejected from the operations room once the guys arrived. She knew what was going down, anyway. No specifics. But you didn‚Äôt bring in uniformed soldiers for regular business. National Intelligence liked to work with their own people.\nFive days prior, Baron hailed an EB/NI company car and it pulled up beside him. The electric passenger window slid down. Baron nodded at the passenger.\n‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs in here. There‚Äôs more if you need it. I‚Äôd appreciate a call, I‚Äôm in my office all next week, okay?‚Äù He passed over a white postage envelope. ‚ÄúTake care.‚Äù The British man opened the letter and read it twice as the car approached the Vekllei World Jetport.\n JULES WYNN IS YOUR 3RD MAN. ‚ÄúJEREMY‚Äù APPEARS IN ARCHIVES 2046 ‚Äî ALMOST CERTAINLY WYNN. NEARLY 20 YEARS. NOTES TO USSR THRU CYPHER CLERK (UNKNOWN). RECALLED TO MOSCOW ‚Äî GREAT SUSPICION OF HIM FROM CONTROLLER DOWSETT-CLARK (OXFORD). THIS IS GOOD INFO FROM PARIS ASSET. WYNN WILL DIE IN RUSSIA. GET HIM AND ANOTHER RING SURFACES. CIA KNOWS WHERE BUT NOT WHO. DO US BOTH A FAVOUR.\n Tzipora went for a walk to clear her head. She had a lot going on in her life ‚Äî though she was sure it seemed small compared to whatever was going on in the operations room. It began to rain an hour into the walk. She‚Äôd left her umbrella with the rest of her things in Baron\u0026rsquo;s office. That was okay. She didn‚Äôt mind the shower, anyway ‚Äî it was mid-summer, and the rain was warm. What a novelty that was, at 60 degrees north. This was weather from the sunny Azores, pulled north by the wind currents over the Atlantic. Within minutes her skirt was heavy and her camisole was showing at the shoulders. She blinked heavy streams of water out of her eyes. She passed the soldiers on their way out as she returned to AB/NI reception. A friendly receptionist had cloaked her in a towel by the time Baron had found her.\n ‚ÄúDid you have a good meeting?‚Äù She asked. ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù and characteristically, he considered that a satisfactory answer. He pulled the towel off her head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre completely soaked.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter. Are you with those guys? About that other guy?‚Äù ‚ÄúWatch it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúKeep that talk past security. But I‚Äôm going to fly out tomorrow. I‚Äôll be back in the evening.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo cooking for me, then. Where are you going? Or can‚Äôt you say?‚Äù ‚ÄúEngland.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Tzipora said, forming a gun with her fingers. ‚ÄúLike James Bond.‚Äù\n Her life was a nexus of various global ambitions, it seemed ‚Äî imagined only through the dreamy lens of a teen-ager too small for the world‚Äôs problems.\n The Last Train Out of Ada üìñ Published 20th May 2020 | Read here.\nThey both watched as train 416 pulled away from the platform. And that was that ‚Äî there would be no school in the morning. That was how it worked in rural Vekllei, a million miles from the automatic trains on endless timetables. Out here, you paced life around the station.\nThere was not much to say about this, between the two of them. Tzipora looked at Cobian and pulled a froggy smile that tried to express that it was nobody‚Äôs fault. Sure ‚Äî it was Tzipora who had misplaced her purse, and it was also true that it was Tzipora who‚Äôd stopped by the orchard to steal a peach, but as to how they‚Äôd missed the train? It was simply impossible to say.\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a complete idiot,‚Äù Cobian said matter-of-factly, and Tzipora wilted. They watched 416 trundle into the sunset. A picturesque vision of rural utopia ‚Äî if only they were a part of it.\n Winter Uniforms in Vekllei üìñ Published 16th May 2020 | Read here.\nWhen I paint Vekllei, I usually depict the warmer months. Hems are shorter, days are longer, and the destabilisation of the world‚Äôs climate has only benefited these arctic people. At the gift end of the Vekllei low pressure system, Scandinavian misery has become Mediterranean pleasure, with warm summers and a mild Autumn and Spring.\nStill, by late October, the the earth is hard with cold and the days are short. The world may be warmer, but Vekllei‚Äôs polar latitude is unchanged, and in the depths of winter the sun only rises for an hour a day. These are Vekllei‚Äôs ‚Äúmoon months‚Äù, and they announce some of the most important spiritual festivals in Upen.\n Although school hours are reduced in winter, life carries on and Vekllei fashion becomes traditionally utilitarian. Tzipora has poor circulation and cold hands even in the warm months, and by November she‚Äôs traded the skirt and gi for traditional rouisha trousers and a cloak. Rouisha, like a lot of traditional clothing, have origins in agriculture and are characterised by a loose, baggy fit and insulated lining. Cobian is wearing a heavy wool sack-type dress, which is worn like an apron over other clothing. Winter brings forth ‚Äúpetticoat society‚Äù literally. Note the leather plate on her shoulder, to which her christmas aiguillette is attached.\n In this sense, Winter‚Äôs revival of traditional clothing and customs further evidences its practice as the most traditional season of the year. Although the warm calendar flourishes with the futurist sympathies of a modernist Vekllei, not even the atomic age has been able to dispense with its hard-worked pragmatism developed in a millennia of bitter cold.\n 2031 Apartment Diagram üìñ Published 15th May 2020 | Read here.\nBaron had inherited the apartment from his uncle, who passed in the year following his parents. It was in a mixed residential-industrial neighbourhood, adjacent to a canvas factory. Out back was a rivulet, which roared in the long rainstorms of early April.\n Each January, the Colour Bureau of the Architecture Assembly announces the year‚Äôs colours, and tradition in mainstream architecture and interior design is to incorporate the announced palettes, which usually contain a hundred or so colours. His uncle‚Äôs apartment had been built and furnished in 2031, and so it had a #2031 Colour Profile.\n In some ways, it was a very conventional apartment in the Vekllei tradition. It had a sauna and bath in the wetroom, a bidet, a sunken living room and a bread oven. In others, it was more peculiar. The apartment was bizarrely allocated across three levels. You alighted the entrance light well into a sunken living space, then climbed back up into the kitchen. The main living room and master bedroom were another step above the kitchen. Adjacent to the main living area was a closet and study, which overlooked the entrance from a half-meter mezzanine.\nIt was in this study that Tzipora set up shop when she arrived in March 2063. Baron had been reluctant to take her even provisionally, not least because it would mean searching for a new apartment in his busy return period after being abroad for ten years. Tzipora, however, had lived in a dormitory for much of her life and had settled in the alcove once she acquired a dresser screen. She refused outright the master bedroom, which sparked a sleepy agoraphobia. By the time Baron had made other accomodations, Tzipora had entrenched herself in the neighbourhood and had developed a severe sentimentality about the apartment and its rivulet, and so that was where he lived for the rest of his life.\nIn this sense, Tzipora had a strange kinship with the apartment. Baron sealed himself off in the master bedroom each night, but she never left the main living space. It was warm in there, especially in the flickering light of the enormous oven and fireplace, and when she moved the screen aside in the morning her little corner became part of the living area.\nShe had a lot of good memories of that apartment.\n Fiery Peaks üìñ Published 7th May 2020 | Read here.\nAfter three days in Ada, Tzipora set off towards Mt Miya. She made good time, and after three hours had happened upon the shoulders of the bright Volouisnesnkull Glacier. It was about here that she heard a morbid industrial siren, echoing up the valleys from far away.\nAt first she thought it might have come from Ada, since Boya Chemical had a large plant there, but as she lay out her things for lunch she heard the distinct whine of a turbojet. It grew louder, and deeper, until a National Fire VTOL tanker roared across the sky, swirling powdered snow on nearby peaks as it arced across the glacier. It was close enough to catch the sun ablaze in the reflection of its glass nosecone.\nShe later learned that lava streams had opened up not far from where she‚Äôd hiked, and had been making their way towards a geothermal power plant nestled in the highlands. In the evening, on her way back, she saw a long line of fire supertankers and pumpers spraying water in beautiful arcs, where it caught hisses from bright streams of melted rock. It was a common enough sight in Vekllei ‚Äî hoses were the only defence you could reasonably make against the the fracturing earth.\nStill, it was not often you saw jets flying so low. It was funny to her that even the barren glaciers were tamed in this age.\n The Chemical Feast üìñ Published 6th May 2020 | Read here.\nEast of Montre, West of Tjornes, waits a rare sight among Vekllei‚Äôs hard igneous slopes ‚Äî a crown of gentle sedimentary cliffs packed with ruddy sandstone, which melt glacially into the sea chasing blue-sky bergs.\nTzipora was, at the time, making her way on foot from Montre-Lola to Ada, which was a coastal town in the North-East known for its luxurious health spas. Tzipora was not much interested in health, but she was interested in walking, and she made a pilgrimage along the coast every few years to make sense of the world. She was going whichaway and destined for nowhere in particular. Tzipora was very much Baron‚Äôs daughter, in the end.\nShe had stopped to see the Red Cliffs forty kilometres out from Tjornes when she saw a cruiser of the constabulary parked unusually by the shore. The constabulary were not local police ‚Äî they were a national outfit tasked with policing government and ‚Äúbureau business‚Äù. You found them at power plants, outside universities, guarding the prime minister and providing bodies for HO/NI (Home Office at National Intelligence) when they needed doors kicked.\nTzipora was not the sort of girl to be intimidated by a badge, and she wandered innocently to the shore where she found the cruiser empty. She looked across a beach of black sand and saw some sort of operation playing out ‚Äî there was a gun boat not too far from the shore, and a police hydrofoil beached on the sand. She counted maybe a dozen officers. She wondered if they‚Äôd arrest her if she walked down to see what was happening. She climbed onto the hood of the cruiser to get a better look. Perhaps it was immigrants ‚Äî or smugglers.\nIt only took another moment to spot the smashed crates broken across the rocks before she knew what was going on. She was witnessing the dying days of the countercultural decade, and its chemical fuel was now smashed open before her.\n The 2070s were a wild time for the so-called ‚Äúpink years‚Äù in Vekllei, and for the first time in Tzipora‚Äôs memory she started seeing ‚Äúpleasure drugs‚Äù on the streets. There had always been plenty of sin carrying on in Vekllei, even in her early days ‚Äî hallucinogenics, alcohol, and synthesised highs were legal and easy. But you didn‚Äôt see much of the exotic stuff, which grew in a better climate. Hash, coke, H ‚Äî it was all underground stuff for personal use. These drugs were listed among many others in the class-A import prohibition orders, which made them hard to find and illegal to import. These were ‚Äúpleasure drugs‚Äù ‚Äî the Vekllei phrase for overseas narcotics that didn‚Äôt have a place in Upen or a preexisting cultural history. Comparatively, they were just ‚Äòfor pleasure‚Äô.\n  H for heroin was a big news item for a long time, and with it you had one the largest moral panics in modern Vekllei cultural memory. Crackdowns came soon after. Tzipora found it difficult to describe the feeling of the time. It was a new generation ‚Äî one she didn‚Äôt belong to, despite her appearance ‚Äî and she didn‚Äôt have much sympathy for hedonists. They might tell her different, but she never thought the pink years were about much more than feeling good all of the time. She wondered if she was growing old and grumpy inside.\n She wondered how the crates had got there. Had the coast guard sunk another smugger? You heard about the navy firing shots in the news sometimes.\nRuined with seawater and picked over by constables, the chemical feast of Vekllei‚Äôs pink years died with the times. Tzipora wouldn‚Äôt miss it.\nShe stepped off the hood and set off back towards the road, where a warm inn and hot food awaited her.\n The Trials of Cobian üìñ Published 2nd May 2020 | Read here.\nAccording to her friends, Tzipora‚Äôs contemporary afflictions were tragic. Her medical problems; her violent childhood; her sensitivity and melancholy ‚Äî you could feel sorry for her, because a lot of her problems were not her fault. She invoked sympathy. Tzipora never considered herself particularly tragic. It seemed straightforward, if difficult; she continued to live ‚Äî and so she lived. Tzipora\u0026rsquo;s sympathy was instead reserved for her first and closest friend: Cobian.\nCobian was not well-liked at school, and it did not take long for Tzipora to find out why. She had a childish edge for a sixteen-year-old, and bitterly hated losing. She was not good at school or sports, was not particularly charming, and came across as desperately lonely. She was a quiet misandrist, which would have been fine if she could play the part of a self-assured social matriarch, but her mother‚Äôs despotic conservatism struck out that possibility early on. Such is life.\nAnd because her world was predicated on being liked and living a normal life, her psyche prohibited self-reflection. That was the great difference between Cobian and Tzipora. They may both have been young and neurotic, but Tzipora‚Äôs relentless self-interrogation left great space for personal growth. Cobian was instead trapped in a domestic play-fantasy, in which she could live out a mythical high-school life, and shattering that illusion would collapse her whole reason for being.\n Tzipora recalled visiting Cobian‚Äôs home for the first time. Cobian‚Äôs mother asked Tzipora to remove her shoes and socks and wash her feet before going to play inside. By the time Tzipora found Cobian in her room, the girl had already changed and handed over her uniform to be laundered. Tzipora, in her tomboyish indigence, had never encountered such a brutally hygienic regime.\n  Cobian was a different girl at home. Her anxiety and neurosis washed out a little, and her confidence was propped up by the routines her mother had set out for her since she was a child. There was a friendly, curious girl buried under a decade of loneliness.\n Tzipora wondered what Cobian thought about lying in bed at night, and why the girl worried so much about things that didn‚Äôt matter. And it was precisely in the smallness of those things and the tremendous anxiety Cobian owed toward them that made Tzipora want to hug her. To be so worked up over something so pathetic was startlingly moving. The idea that the girl had deluded herself into a corner of hopelessness seemed sad ‚Äî and the fact that no one would reasonably care about such a feeble, meaningless, self-inflicted state of affairs made it tragic.\nThrough Tzipora‚Äôs friendship and the world it opened up for her, some of Cobian‚Äôs edges were sanded down. Some of it was a late maturity ‚Äî some of it was Tzipora‚Äôs dismantling of the scaffolding the girl‚Äôs mother had shoved in there. With that effort, and obvious love, Cobian‚Äôs reason for being changed too. One day, in Tzipora‚Äôs presence, it didn‚Äôt seem so important to be liked by everybody anymore.\n V. The Book Club A Cashless Tokyo üìñ Published 28th December 2018\nClick here to read this essay standalone on this site  ‚ùñ Note from the Editor This essay was published on the original Vekllei site in February 2019. Since it will not be coming back, it is being reprinted here in a desperate attempt to fill out this issue. Yes, it‚Äôs painfully self-concerned and a little painful to read back, but for newcomers to the project you might find some ‚Äúobvious truths‚Äù about Vekllei you have not yet encountered.   I did not come to Tokyo to find a reference for the Petticoat Project, because utopia does not exist there for me. In fact, by nearly every Vekllei metric, Tokyo is positively dystopian ‚Äî a consumer paradise of the crushing, isolating modernity Vekllei is supposed to escape. And yet, marks of this city (and this country) are prevalent through Vekllei as a constructed country and my aesthetic as a writer and an artist. I can‚Äôt bring myself to love all of Japanese society, but I do love the country and its people. This intersection between traditional utopian world-building (along the lines of News from Nowhere or even the original Utopia) and the emotional, linear fragments of utopian storytelling which realise the cold encyclopaedia of a utopian world were the focus of my expedition to Japan. The premise of Vekllei society is at odds with so much of Japanese society ‚Äî yet the emotional, aesthetic culture of the country (what I call the ‚Äòcharacter‚Äô of utopianism) has influenced my media creation tremendously.\nAs a supplementary preface, I would like to note that it would be terrible of me to dismiss Japan as an oriental wonder of salarymen and neo-Zaibatsu. That approach has more in common with Frank Capra‚Äôs wartime propaganda piece Know Your Enemy: Japan than it does with real structural criticism. It is all too easy to dismiss the social and economic conditions of the country today as the natural inclination of a Japanese caricature ‚Äî a homogenous hive-mind of enormously productive and obedient people. This is of course a terrible attack on the proud and long-standing tradition of dissent and progressiveness in the country ‚Äî which is also home to one of the world‚Äôs largest opposition communist parties. It is a country of student mobilisation, protests and intense factionalism between the left and right-wing radicals (Andrews, W., 2016). It is important not to conflate the impersonal structures of a society with the orientalist idea of cultural predisposition.\nA love of Studio Ghibli films and a desire for material and emotional escapism is what drives my utopian world-building. Where co-founder Isao Takahata had a penchant for artful emotional realism and domestic drama, Hayao Miyazaki has found tremendous success in Japan and abroad with his fantastical stories rich with nostalgia and warmth. They have obvious recurring themes ‚Äî childhood, environmentalism, aircraft, etc., but it is no real secret (at least to media critics and Ghibli superfans) that these overt recurrences are symptomatic of more serious and grounded beliefs. In a fantastic analysis of My Neighbour Totoro, Phillip E. Wegner makes use of Kojin Karatani‚Äôs works (another great influence of mine) to illustrate Miyazaki‚Äôs uniquely Japanese pre-Meiji cross-generational nostalgia evident in the film.\n What Miyazaki presents us with in My Neighbor Totoro is a vision in which the classic \u0026ldquo;what if\u0026rdquo; question of the genre has been proposed: that is, what if the Meiji revolution did not happen? Moreover, since it is the dramatic and rapid modernization of the Meiji period that gives rise to the virulent imperialist nationalism and militarism that ultimately results in the Second World War, Miyazaki also offers in his film us a glimpse of a Japan in which the catastrophe of World War II did not occur (Wegner, P.E., 2010).\n Japan‚Äôs spectre of modernity is a recurring character in many of Miyazaki‚Äôs films, just as the villain of war revives itself time and time again ‚Äî from the steel production of Iron Town in Princess Mononoke to the death of the golden age of aviation in The Wind Rises. Karatani‚Äôs landmark work, Origins of Japanese Literature, makes clear that basic premises of modern society ‚Äî from children to history to nature ‚Äî are not immutable items atomised by scientific fact, but instead products of modern society that have not always existed (Karatani, K., 1993. pp. 12-44, 113-135). Vekllei reflects this concept, at least superficially ‚Äî children are represented as independent agents desegregated from modern age-based schooling, nature is regarded as a fellow social organ, and work is largely self-satisfying and decommodified. These are things that are important to me and it makes sense enough that Vekllei reflects that.\nSimilarly, even supposedly less political Ghibli films like Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service carry powerful images of the ‚Äòspectre of modernity‚Äô. Regarding the climax of the film in which a zeppelin soars hopelessly out of control over a city, A.J. Rocca hauntingly writes:\n [We] find that this is not truly a witch‚Äôs story, but a ghost story. The ghost died in a fire on 6 May 1937, foreshadowing the fires of a war that would change the world forever. The ghost is called the Spirit of Freedom in the film, but its true name is LZ 129 Hindenburg, and it‚Äôs not the spirit of freedom but the ghost of modernity (Rocca, 2017).\n So the material manifestation of Japanese society for me‚Äî despite all the glory of her bright packaging and dense infrastructure ‚Äî is an aesthetic and satirical media culture that saturates the Petticoat Project. Vekllei is a \u0026lsquo;poor man‚Äôs Utopia\u0026rsquo;, inspired in part by my superficial understanding of a ‚Äòpoor man‚Äôs Japan'. Vekllei, like media representations of postwar Sh≈çwa Japan, has a shadow of pacifism and shame about it (that idea that \u0026lsquo;all politics is sexual pathology‚Äô occurs to me). These are deliberate aesthetic choices that reflect not landscape utopianism but character utopianism ‚Äî the real colour of a constructed world that acts out the structure of mean ideology and culture-constructs. These ill-defined images of utopian society, and a rejection of landscape world-building, are excellent vehicles for utopian writing. After all, it is sustained engagement with utopia that betrays the totality of it (Wegner, P.E., 1998). What fascinates me particularly about Miyazaki‚Äôs unique utopian instincts is his recurring premise is essentially nostalgic and escapist ‚Äî the aesthetic of a Miyazaki film is almost always midcentury or earlier, illustrating a time before Japan‚Äôs ‚Äòmodern century‚Äô. This is in stark contrast to the saccharine optimism of utopian socialists like Morris, Chernyshevsky, and Bellemy, telling stories of a future yet to come.\nAnd that is to say nothing of the aesthetic qualities of a Japanese city! Tokyo is a wonderful glimpse of a retro-future as imagined by the 1980s ‚Äî as though the economic crisis of the 1990s has since suspended time. Japan is clean and modern, but also retrofuturistic. The lifeblood of the city is in rebar and concrete as infrastructure. The people on the street are dressed in conservative items that go without the prudish connotations of similar Western fashion. Working men and women are suited traditionally, many with waistcoats. Such is the visual language of modern Japan. Young men sport tech-wear or innovative types of street-wear dominated by colour and comfort. General women‚Äôs fashion leans heavily on items popularly discarded in Western markets, at least until recently. Pleat or patterned skirts, blouses, cardigans, hosiery and socks, loafers and brogues, etc. are very common and provide a wonderful anecdotal rebuff to the outrageous images of ‚ÄòHarajuku girls‚Äô and Lolita style that epitomise some ideas of Japanese fashion. The famous ‚Äòsailor uniform‚Äô has been largely phased out of junior and senior high schooling, replaced with Western-style blazers and ties. Tokyo is not ‚Äòbehind‚Äô the rest of the world; that is not what it means to be retrofuturistic. In my eyes, it has disembarked from Western technological and fashion attitudes some time ago and has since progressed on its own collective cultural intuition, and has subsequently spent the last few decades exporting media, fashion and culture into the West. It‚Äôs a great thing to see in person, at the heart of it all.\nDespite my qualms with modern Japanese consumer society, Vekllei is perched on a romanticised and fictitious Japanese aesthetic, and the country is enormously influential on the way I go about world-construction. With one sentence I will denounce the complexity of Japanese honorific language systems and in the other fawn over the mixed agricultural-residential suburbs that make up so much of the land outside of Tokyo‚Äôs city limits. Koka parks were inspired by these displays of community food production. The Vekllei Constabulary were created after research and experience with the Japanese Police Box system. Vekllei‚Äôs knotted network of trains and streetcars are reminiscent of Tokyo and Hiroshima. For all my public rejection of modern consumer society, and my begrudging participation in it, the Japanese qualities of Vekllei are valuable and are utopian in their own right ‚Äî and so Tokyo remains one of the most important inspirations of Petticoat Society in the world.\nSo what of that dichotomy? Of deep ideological incongruities with Japanese consumer society, but an embarrassing affection for the mythological post-war aesthetic and Japanese culture? The truth of it is that Vekllei is first and foremost a collection of stories, and stories are the domain of the emotional. Wonderful, vague images of utopia ‚Äî like washing corn in My Neighbour Totoro or an all-night writing session in Whisper of the Heart. My time in Tokyo introduced me to a wealth of these nostalgic feelings ‚Äî of curiosity in a cauldron of social atomisation. Life in Tokyo is not without problems, and it is certainly not my perfect idea of utopia, but the intersection of the culture and promise of Japanese society, either in the past as alt-history or in the future as science fiction, has me coming back time and time again to better realise my own projects of utopia.\nWorks cited above:\nAndrews, W., 2016.

It is also the site of a small Vekllei National University laboratory which examines the dam environment and trains its staff.\n \u0026ndash; The Ou Hydroburo Office\nO u is a borough in the central Ro Highlands of Vekllei, located southwest of Laisiyo and north of Kyala. It is named after Bakur, an ancient fishing town with history that predates unified settlement in Vekllei. It has the smallest population of any borough in Vekllei, at only 7,500 permanent residents, which fluctuates seasonally. It is most famous for being home to the site of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Deep-Sea Cartography Mission, an initiative of the Ocean Office of the Vekllei Government. This also means Bakur has the highest population of scientific personnel per capita of any borough in Vekllei.\nEtymology Ou is a Topyas pure Ocean Vowel meaning \u0026ldquo;spirit\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;personhood\u0026rdquo;, and in its written form is considered a core Rapotenne rune in Upen. Ou is considered the birthplace of demons in Upen mythology, who emerged from the Valley of the Dead to return humans to the spirit world. For this reason, Ou is considered a sacred borough in Vekllei and much of its territory remains untouchable Crown Land.\nHistory Artefacts recovered from north of the town of Aya in Bakur date to nearly 1000BC, approaching earliest estimates of known settlement in the Vekllei Home Islands. Bakur\u0026rsquo;s first residents were likely nomadic arctic peoples immigrating from nearby Kala (Greenland) looking for hunting grounds in winter. Sagas confirm the town of Bakur was established in the 14th Century AD to support the creation of an arctic naval fort, but the fort was abandoned less than a hundred years later and few residents remained, leaving Bakur mostly abandoned until the early 19th Century, when it was reestablished as a base of operations for Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s colonial whaling fleet. Today it remains a shrinking fishing town, bolstered only by seasonal workers imported by the Ocean Office.\nThe town is the birthplace of celebrated Vekllei folk songwriter Tohs Viskaismesn (1847-1912).\nSignificance in Upen Hydrotown Development Postwar reelectrification Geography The Bakur borough is home to some of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s most spectacular subarctic scenery, dominated lava slopes, ice fields, and fjords. Its position among the Westernmost boroughs in Vekllei makes it a great staging town for Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s expansive fishing fleet, including line and trawling vessels.\nValley of the Dead Infrastructure Hydroburo Development Ada Rocketry Base Towns  Ou Ada Tiamoin   Posts  Philately Foolery    ","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/d-kyala/","title":"Kyala"},{"content":"Letters From the Editor -mail  ‚ùñ Note from the Editor I occasionally publish letters to followers and patrons of the project to keep them informed on what\u0026rsquo;s going on.

I use an iPhone paired to an Apple Watch and AirPods on the go, a MacBook Air at home, and an AppleTV in the living room. A bit more wilful consumerism, and I could complete my collection ‚Äî a HomePod, or $6000 ProDisplay XDR perhaps. I like my RAM soldered to the board, ladies and gentlemen.\nI am also a vocal critic, through my art and politics, of commodity culture and modern consumer society. Congratulations if you\u0026rsquo;ve picked up on what you might recognise as a contradiction. I talk big about human life emptied out and objectified through industrial society, while shilling for the worst kind of tech ‚Äî consumer tech ‚Äî and the worst kind of consumer tech ‚Äî locked down, closed in, proprietary walled garden expensive tech. I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is hypocritical, necessarily. People are complex, and I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t disparage someone for etching out pleasure through consumption if that\u0026rsquo;s what it takes to keep going in our shell-world. But I\u0026rsquo;d like to address my consumerism here.\nI\u0026rsquo;m pretty much stuck in the Apple ecosystem, whether I like it or not (I do, in fact, like it). This wasn\u0026rsquo;t always the case. I bought my first iPhone as a teenager, an iPhone 6 Plus, but traded it in for the objectively shitty and wonderful Nexus 5X in my senior year. I used that until it desoldered itself through its insane thermal issues. I went back to my 6 Plus, then bought the Google Pixel 2 XL when it came out. I bought a Google DayDream (a VR headset) with it, and came dangerously close to buying an Android watch (a prescient moment). This isn\u0026rsquo;t evidence of impartiality, or a defense against accusations of fanboyism. It\u0026rsquo;s evidence of my preference for vertical integration, control, permanence and the product-form.\nTech is an intimate part of life, so why shouldn\u0026rsquo;t we see ourselves in tech? My feelings towards products are generally dependent on my personal intuition, not their specs or costs. The things I have in my life aren\u0026rsquo;t tools, they\u0026rsquo;re appliances; objects, and should delight you in their good design and usefulness. I suppose there\u0026rsquo;s a spiritual component to it, and I won\u0026rsquo;t apologise for that. It bubbles up from an instinct for control, unity and simplicity. This does not apply exclusively to Apple products, this is more fundamental than that ‚Äî it folds into a larger conception of appliances and design. I might get caught up in a hype cycle, or drink the kool-aid on a few occasions, but this isn\u0026rsquo;t intellectual, it\u0026rsquo;s instinctive, and it informs much more than petty consumerism.\nThere are good reasons why Vekllei is so cleanly vertically integrated, so culturally homogenous, and so absolute in its absence of money. These aspects of my work arise from the same instinct that determines one perfect language; one perfect religion; one perfect uniform; one perfect architecture. It is not that a moneyless utopia is an interesting thought-experiment; it\u0026rsquo;s that a utopia could only be moneyless. This is a binary instinct ‚Äî it is, or it isn\u0026rsquo;t. It evolves constantly with taste.\nWalter Isaacson, in the biography of Steve Jobs, wrote of his legacy:\n [Jobs\u0026rsquo;s] intensity encouraged a binary view of the world. Colleagues referred to the hero/shithead dichotomy. You were either one or the other, sometimes on the same day. The same was true of products, ideas, even food: Something was either ‚Äúthe best thing ever,‚Äù or it was shitty, braindead, inedible. As a result, any perceived flaw could set off a rant. The finish on a piece of metal, the curve of the head of a screw, the shade of blue on a box, the intuitiveness of a navigation screen‚Äîhe would declare them to ‚Äúcompletely suck‚Äù until that moment when he suddenly pronounced them ‚Äúabsolutely perfect.‚Äù He thought of himself as an artist, which he was, and he indulged in the temperament of one.1 p.309\n I\u0026rsquo;ve seen people diagnose Jobs as autistic, an insult to both autistic people and Jobs. Jobs was well aware of his apparent cruelty, and finely socially attuned. Steve Jobs, by any account, was a deeply flawed human individual with a very sincere belief in good taste and design. Another passage recalls his incompatibility with a girlfriend:\n They also had a basic philosophical difference about whether aesthetic tastes were fundamentally individual, as Redse believed, or universal and could be taught, as Jobs believed. She accused him of being too influenced by the Bauhaus movement. ‚ÄúSteve believed it was our job to teach people aesthetics, to teach people what they should like,‚Äù she recalled. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt share that perspective. I believe when we listen deeply, both within ourselves and to each other, we are able to allow what‚Äôs innate and true to emerge.‚Äù1 p.158\n There are plenty of rude visionaries in Silicon Valley, and so-called \u0026ldquo;tech culture\u0026rdquo; is empty and superficial. But few people possess the sort of magical intuition Jobs had, or his deep appreciation for taste and design. Plenty of companies innovate, but Apple strikes me as a principles company. It makes decisions that make no market sense, like cutting the headphone jack, which generated far more negative press than short-term sales in bluetooth headphones.\n I think most creative people want to express appreciation for being able to take advantage of the work that‚Äôs been done by others before us. I didn‚Äôt invent the language or mathematics I use. I make little of my own food, none of my own clothes. Everything I do depends on other members of our species and the shoulders that we stand on. And a lot of us want to contribute something back to our species and to add something to the flow. It‚Äôs about trying to express something in the only way that most of us know how‚Äîbecause we can‚Äôt write Bob Dylan songs or Tom Stoppard plays. We try to use the talents we do have to express our deep feelings, to show our appreciation of all the contributions that came before us, and to add something to that flow. That‚Äôs what has driven me.\n I believe deeply that design matters, and that the stuff around us should reflect that.\nCited Works   Isaacson, W. (2011). Steve Jobs.

It is well-known in Vekllei as the site of the Lita Cosmodrome, the primary launch site for industrial and scientific spacecraft. It is also the de facto headquarters of the Cosmos Office (Cosmoburo), even if its operations remain de jure centred in Vekllei Proper. The population of the town of Lita and its neighbouring villages is heavily affected by the Cosmodrome, transforming the borough into one of the primary astronomy and astrophysics hubs of the country.\nHistory Lita is relatively isolated from the coasts by its dramatic mountain ranges and glacial terrain, and remained uninhabited until the establishment of the Vekllei Missile Programme in the mid-20th Century. Lita first served as a closed government town supporting the Vekllei Rocketry Corps (today the Rocket Navy of the Vekllei Commonwealth Armed Forces).

A dead leaf moving by miracle across still water; an overturned bucket collecting dew along its handle; fern leaves half-curled, young and growing.\n \u0026ndash; City Rivers\nT he borough of Lo is an administrative region in southwest Vekllei, located in the Capital Region south of Bouisgeh and west of Voya Voya. It covers the entire area of Voya Voya, a city of some 450,000 people in the capital\u0026rsquo;s extended metro area renowned for its parkland and green spaces. Voya Voya makes up part of the capital\u0026rsquo;s satellite belt of boroughs, characterised by green space and mixed-use residential planning. Voya Voya is often referred to as the capital\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;garden borough\u0026rdquo; for its density and quality of parkland and forest reserves.\nEtymology Voya Voya is transliterated as \u0026ldquo;Good Good,\u0026rdquo; through in practice is better translated as \u0026ldquo;Good Place,\u0026rdquo; analogous to English towns like \u0026ldquo;Goodwood.\u0026rdquo; It refers to the natural temperate rainforests of its area, much of which are preserved in its parks and in its northern Crown Land. It is only one of a handful of Vekllei cities to use Topyas emphasis through repetition, which has more or less been superseded in modern Vekllei by duplicate consonants.\nHistory  What\u0026rsquo;s that smell? Smell it. It smells like the freshest thing I\u0026rsquo;ve ever smelled.\n \u0026ndash; Tzipora Desmoisnes, after visiting Voya Voya for the first time\nVoya Voya\u0026rsquo;s area originally included several small villages founded in the early Middle Period, which by the 19th Century had developed into satellite suburbs of the industrious capital area. This expansion was encouraged by the Atlantic Junta from the mid-1850s through to the early 1930s, during which Voya Voya tripled in population. By the mid-20th Century, it had become apparent that the sprawling Capital metro area had become overextended, and threatened to link up further with boroughs in Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s interior, beyond the glaciers. A \u0026lsquo;green belt\u0026rsquo; programme was announced in 1956, and saw significant portions of Voya Voya and its nearby boroughs preserved as untouchable forests. During this period, Voya Voya was known mostly as a working-class satellite to the wealthier coastal boroughs of the capital.\nDuring the Atomic War, the area\u0026rsquo;s permanent rainforest was protected from firestorms by the scorched impact craters in the neighbouring boroughs of Coyenstisn and Lava, and nearby Cusi Lake.\nPostwar Development The Atomic War collapsed the capital area, and dramatically reduced the population of Voya Voya\u0026rsquo;s neighbouring boroughs. Although the borough itself did not receive direct strikes, the subsequent fallout and social collapse saw starvation and emigration from the borough throughout occupation and into independence.\nIn the Floral Period, protections first developed by the Junta for Voya Voya\u0026rsquo;s green belt were extended by the Floral Government, including the establishment of a Crown Land in its north and the clearing of rubble and replanting of rainforest throughout its inhabited interior. The architects of early independence reduced the density of the borough dramatically, clearing land for parks that now characterise the city.\nIn 2076, Voya Voya was named Borough of the Year by the Festival Commission, which saw it heavily reported by documentary films and tourism material.\nGeography Voya Voya is flat and low-lying, though its border extends to the dramatic hills of the southern Thanveler Glacier. It is cool and wet, and has large areas of temperate rainforest typical of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s southern coast. Rainforest flora are also found in the city of Voya Voya, where tree ferns grow in alleys and in roundabouts. The city itself is medium-rise, like much of the capital, but checkered into planned areas of habitation and parkland. Aqueducts carrying water from the Hydroburo collectors in Thanveler criss-cross its streets and parks.\nCrown Land Voya Voya\u0026rsquo;s Crown Land is an area of forbidden rainforest north of the city area, and was officially struck from Floral Government sovereignty in 2025. It remains a densely forested area belonging to the Land Sovereign, and has tremendous influence on both the culture and composition of the city.\nCusi Lake Cusi Lake is a natural body of water to Voya Voya\u0026rsquo;s southwest, which has doubled in size since the construction of the Cusi Hydroelectric Dam in 1965. Its area is split between the boroughs of Voya Voya, Lo, Coyenstisn, and Lava. As a controlled lake, it is popular for watercraft and swimming, though is extremely cold throughout the year due to runoff from distant glaciers.\nInfrastructure Although Voya Voya is best known for its parks, it is also highly accessible from the capital, linked by a variety of rail lines including bullet trains to the South Coast, Lonne and Thanveler. It is also the origin of the capital area\u0026rsquo;s aqueduct system, a network of open-air water bridges originating in southern Voya Voya, which were first built in the 19th Century and rebuilt in the 21st. Although tourist infrastructure is sparse, it remains a popular borough for day-trips from coastal hotels, a trip made trivial by the density of the capital\u0026rsquo;s rail network.\nThe Water Commission Aqueduct Pumpworks The Water Commission (Hydroburo) Pumpworks in Voya Voya supplies pressure for aqueducts in the city and its neighbouring boroughs. It pulls water from both Cusi Lake and open aqueducts from Thanveler, and pushes water through an elevated network of bridges across the area. After its elevation, water is pulled by gravity with pressure from water towers. The aqueduct system provides water for all parkland in Voya Voya. The Pumpworks is a large brick/Newda facility on Cusi Lake, and its pumps are powered by on-site geothermal steam wells, as they have for a century. Small railcars called Microsweeps run along the open-air aqueducts to clear blockages and sediment.\nBotanical Gardens of Voya Voya The Voya Voya Botanical Gardens are a complex of green areas covering about 12 city blocks, housing mostly indigenous flora. While the Royal Botanical Gardens in Vekllei Proper feature international gardens sampling every continent on Earth, Voya Voya\u0026rsquo;s Gardens are managed as educational public spaces celebrating local landscapes and rainforest. Its facilities include a fair and parade ground, Newda parks, lakes and ponds, rainforests, and greenhouse infrastructure. The Botanical Gardens are the site of festivals in Voya Voya, and often celebrate live music and theatre.\nHydroburo Aqueduct Beautification Scheme In celebration of 50 years of independence, in 2065 the Hydroburo embarked on an ambitious public art project to celebrate the South Coast\u0026rsquo;s ancient aqueduct network. Coordinated from Voya Voya, the site of the Aqueduct Pumpworks, Voya Voya\u0026rsquo;s aqueducts were embossed with tiled murals over the course of about ten years, and were finally completed in March 2076. Its contruction employed nearly 1,500 artists and locals in its peak. Voya Voya\u0026rsquo;s aqueducts are widely recognised as some of the most beautiful pieces of civic infrastructure in the world.\nAll-Smiles Ice Cream Factory All-Smiles Ice Cream, the second-most consumed brand in Vekllei, are headquartered in Voya Voya. Its manufactory, A.S.

Its area is highly volcanic and is home to several natural features, including the Gismavik Dome and the Miyatsimi Geyser Fields. The area outside of the city of Miyatvousi is sparsely populated and mostly claimed by flower-tundras and Crown Land.\nEtymology Miyatvousi is an Old Vekllei combination of the words for \u0026ldquo;mineral\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;vision,\u0026rdquo; which in this case refer to indigenous mythos around still, mirror-like pools common to flower tundras in the area. Its name implies a connection between the physical landscape of the Miyatvousi area and the spirit world.\nHistory  All pools, under the dormant skin of the Earth, lead to other realms.\n \u0026ndash; Verse 112, God Saga, 11th Century\nAlthough Miyatvousi has been recognised as a significant cultural site in Upen, the borough housed no major settlements until the formal incorporation of the town of Miyatvousi into the eastern dominion of the Atlantic Junta in the 17th Century. Previously, the land was inhabited by minor agricultural communities, most tending to livestock. Cultural artefacts found in the borough suggest human settlement may date back to the 10th Century, but by the end of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Middle Period the borough was regarded as an empty Spirit Land.\nIn Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Late Period, the town of Miyatvousi remained small and agricultural, and was considered an insignificant settlement.\nPostwar Development Shortly after independence in the postwar period, Miyatvousi was surveyed by the Electric Company of Vekllei (now Magma-Electric Commission of Vekllei/Thunderburo) for its proximity to exploitable geothermal sites. In 2025, construction began on what is now the sprawling Miyatvousi Magma-Electric Power \u0026amp; Flash Plant, which began operation in 2029 and was expanded with several satellite wells and turbine plants in the the subsequent decades.\nThe city of Miyatvousi has since become a major so-called \u0026ldquo;Magma Town\u0026rdquo; with a growing population employed directly by the M.E.C.\nThe town of Poka, in the south of the borough, was the setting of the popular Six Rings film franchise, and is a minor domestic tourist attraction.\nThe borough is now a major contributor of lamb towards Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s food pool, and is home to several agricultural shows throughout its villages and townships each year.\nGeography Miyatvousi is sparsely populated and highly volcanic, and the majority of its land-area is characterised by flower-tundras, geysers, steam pools and other geological phenomena. Its largest settlements are in the east of the borough, with its west dominated by the Miyatvouosi-Lavavik Crown Lands.\nMiyatvousi\u0026rsquo;s Gismavik Dome is one of the largest dormant volcanoes in Vekllei, and is constantly monitored by the Volcanoes Bureau and Geological Survey for shifts in volcanic activity. The size of its magma pool is of serious concern, since an eruption would be catastrophic to the greater Miyatvousi/Groisniyah area.\nMiyatvousi Mirror-Pools Large coloured mineral pools are common to the flower-tundras, produced either by underground superheated springs or from runoff from geothermal power activity. The largest of these are popular local attractions, and are traditionally bathed in by locals for health or religious reasons.\nInfrastructure Miyatvousi is linked to the coast via the Vekllei Central Highland Bullet Train, which has contributed to its postwar presence as an arterial link to Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s North Coast. The borough is best known for its production of geothermal power and support facilities which contribute a majority amount of electricity to Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s East Coast Supply.\nMiyatvousi Magma-Electric Power \u0026amp; Flash Plant The Miyatvousi Magma-Electric Power Plant (M.E.C.A.) is a sprawling complex of geothermal power facilities located west of the city of Miyatvousi. Expanded several times over its five-decades-long life, the facility now includes several distinct power plants, numbered 1 through 4. M.E.C.A. is a supercritical geothermal plant, and was the first of its kind in Vekllei.\nMiyatvousi Farm Co-operative S.P. Miyatvousi remains heavily agricultural, and most of the borough\u0026rsquo;s food export is monopolised through the Miyatvousi Farm Co-operative S.P.

It is best known for its touristy seaside and bright white beaches, which take advantage of Southwest Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s warm gulf climate.\nHistory Although people have lived in Mumen since the earliest days of Vekllei settlement, the Borough of Mumen was incorporated in 1996 from two previously existing municipalities, called Sizm and Musma. When we talk about Mumen today, we usually talk about its vibrant immigrant fusion cultures, made up of Greeks, Croations, Italians and Spanish migrants that arrived throughout the late 20th Century.\nIn the late 1990s, Mumen was revitalised as part of a broader effort towards modernising Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s tourist infrastructure, much of which survived the atomic bombing. The borough\u0026rsquo;s signature white beaches, along with its seaside resorts and promenades, were constructed during this time. Although highly visited by foreign and domestic tourists alike, the city of Mumen is less travelled, and retains the dense migrant community districts of its prewar years.

It is also the site of a small Vekllei National University laboratory which examines the dam environment and trains its staff.\n \u0026ndash; The Ou Hydroburo Office\nT he borough of Ou is an administrative region in the central Ro Highlands of Vekllei, located southwest of Laisiyo and north of Kyala. It is named after Ou, a prominent agricultural town of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Middle Period that was transformed in the 20th Century into the cultural and military centre of the Ro Region. At nearly 1.2 million residents, Ou was narrowly excluded from becoming one of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s five Crown Boroughs in 2021, but remains the second-largest borough of the Ro Highlands, after Lonne. Its importance to Upen leads most Upen-observing Vekllei people to regard Ou as a sacred borough.\nEtymology Ou is a Topyas pure Ocean Vowel meaning \u0026ldquo;spirit\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;personhood\u0026rdquo;, and in its written form is considered a core Rapotenne rune in Upen. Ou is regarded as the birthplace of demons in Upen mythology, who emerged from the Valley of the Dead to return humans to the spirit world. For this reason, Ou is considered a sacred borough in Vekllei and much of its territory remains untouchable Crown Land.\nHistory Ou was settled originally as a rest stop between the burgeoning trading town of Montre and the southern port city of Vekllei circa 1440, and by 1480 had developed into a \u0026ldquo;glorious township\u0026rdquo; subject to the sovereign monarch of Vekllei. Its settlement was originally plagued by crop failure, which was considered a curse for encroaching on the sacred land of the nearby Valley of the Dead.\nIn 1520, as a result of the ongoing food scarcity in the wake of the Junta\u0026rsquo;s rebellion, Ou suffered a famine that killed the majority of its population.\nIn the late 19th Century, Ou was incorporated into the Atlantic Junta\u0026rsquo;s electrification program, which incorporated the borough and its major towns into the Southern Vekllei power network. The town of Ou was a major staging point for network extensions northward, which would see Montre electrified in 1886.\nThe town is the birthplace of Yelsi Visma (1976-2063), who represented Vekllei in gymnastics at the 2000 Paris Olympics and was the recipient of the 2025 Vekllei Person of the Year.\nSignificance in Upen The Saga of Spirits, an undated oral myth dating at least to 150BC, describes the region around Ou as the birthplace of demons.\n [There were] sick mountains, falling to spirits, between Sko and Nuc [present-day Mt Scohe and the Adey Range], the spirit went there to die, and from the place he died emerged a creature of misfortune, blessed by Ku [god of death].\n \u0026ndash; Verse 16, Saga of Spirits\nDemons in Upen are creatures that emerge from the places spirits die, and access the human world through the resting places of souls (most commonly flower-tundras). The Saga of Spirits suggests that demons were created accidentally by a selfish spirit and the death of a wicked man, and that Ku, the god of death, learned from this event how to entice their creation.\nAs demons remain an important aspect of Upen mythology, Ou\u0026rsquo;s Valley of the Dead (the place described in the passage above) is regarded as one of the most sacred sites in Vekllei. Its closest town, Tiamoin, is the site of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Festival of Rest, a spectacle designed to attract the attention of demons to allow human souls easy passage to the spirit world. Since the Valley of the Dead\u0026rsquo;s flower-tundra is considered especially close to the spirit world, many other rituals take place here, including sumoirnesdenen (ego-death) and communion with spirits.\nHydrotown Development In 1912, Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s dwindling economic outlook and failing electrification programme led the governing Atlantic Junta to explore the establishment of hydroelectric dams, to put the unemployed to work and stabilise the southern power network. The construction of Ou\u0026rsquo;s first dam in 1916 marked the beginning of a broader hydroelectric initiative in the region, which had a radical effect on the cultural makeup of the borough. Two of Ou\u0026rsquo;s major towns, Ada and Tiamoin, were first founded as \u0026ldquo;hydro towns\u0026rdquo; by migrant Chinese labourers employed by the Hydro-Electric Commission (HEC), which to this day represent major centres of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Chinese population.\nAfter major construction by the HEC ceased in the early 1930s, Ou\u0026rsquo;s towns continued to support the hydro infrastructure and power plants that supplied electricity to Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s north coast in Afouismeh and Lava.\nPostwar Redevelopment Shortly after independence in 2015, Ou was ranked by the Vekllei War Recovery Bureau as a borough of \u0026ldquo;critical need\u0026rdquo;. Its preexisting status as a Hydro Borough prompted research towards the expansion of the newly-formed Hydroburo\u0026rsquo;s presence in the area, looking to replicate the prewar success of the borough\u0026rsquo;s original hydroelectric initiative.\nIn 2018, new construction began on the Ou Hydroburo Office, a pumping and power plant complex designed to establish a postwar Hydroburo presence in the borough and supply fresh water to communities in the Ro Region. The construction accompanied a housing revitalisation effort towards the city of Ou and its nearby towns, building new apartments and parks to facilitate immigration from Southern Europe after the Atomic War.\nThe Floral Period in Ou, much like the rest of the country, was marked by widespread immigration and population growth, which saw the city of Ou double in size between 2015 and 2046.\nGeography Ou lies in the heart of the central Ro Highlands, a region dominated by dramatic mountain ranges, minor volcanoes, and flat highlands flower-tundras central to the Vekllei physical identity. Ou is known especially for the density and beauty of its flower-tundras, making it a popular tourist region and pilgrimage destination for Vekllei people. All of Ou\u0026rsquo;s major towns are shielded by its surrounding mountains, keeping weather mild and clear throughout the year. Ou also receives good sun, and is considerably warmer than its southwestern neighbours. It is also home to Stelavik and Cosmivik, two active volcanoes that erupt periodically.\nValley of the Dead The Valley of the Dead is a sheltered flower-tundra between the Scohe and Adey mountain ranges of great spiritual importance to Upen. It is one of the largest such tundra in Ou, covering nearly 2000 acres west of Tiamoin. As Crown Land, it is completely bare of infrastructure or permanent human presence and requires an hour\u0026rsquo;s walk from the nearest station to access.\nInfrastructure In addition to its spiritual significance, Ou is best known as a hub for both the Hydroburo and Thunderburo in the Ro Highlands. Several geothermal and hydroelectric power stations operate in the area, in addition to small nuclear facilities, water-treatment plants and water storage facilities designed to supply the region with fresh glacial water.\nGeothermal Power The Ada Geothermal Power Station was built in the Magma-Electric Commission\u0026rsquo;s northern plans in 2047 to support the expansion of grid-independent military presence in Ou.

Introduction Vekllei language, abbreviated to just Vekllei, has six core sublanguages that are used commonly today. Although they often intersect, these different systems of communication are distinct languages in their own right, used for different purposes in different arenas of communication.\nLanguage Systems in Vekllei  Spoken Vekllei, which is everyday spoken language. It draws from two glossaries with different meanings and feelings, called Oa and Loh. Topet, which are logographic characters (occasionally characterised as hieroglyphs). Like other pictographic languages, Topet characters can be broken down into repeating components, called Topotte. Rapotenne, is the traditional logographic language of names. It is much older than Topet, and has more in common with spiritual runes than modern logography. Potenne, lit. ‚ÄúHand-Talk‚Äù, is a sign language that incorporates gestures and signing to add meaning to emotion to spoken language, and occasionally in place of it. Upotenne, lit. ‚ÄúSpirit-Hand-Talk‚Äù, as the recreation of runes in human form, used limitedly in spiritual ritual. Vekllei Semaphore is the codification of colour and shape. Traditionally limited to colour, shape and pattern are now also included in Vekllei Semaphore, in which full sentences can be formed.    2.

The Vekllei Economy Sundress Municipalism 1. Participatory Economics in Utopia 1.1. Introduction The daily functioning of the Vekllei economy is as miraculous as it is unique. Key organs and mechanisms of the Vekllei economy reality are positioned against or outright opposed against each other. And a startling series of contradictions \u0026ndash; one after the other, each more unusual than the last. Vekllei is a planned economy; it is also a free market. Property ownership is obfuscated by portioned sovereignty of land and product. Decommodification has devalued products in a country based on manufacturing. There are many contradictions, inefficiencies and simply unusual mechanisms in the Vekllei domestic market, and this article hopes to elucidate at least some of them.\nThe Bureau System, sometimes called Product Socialism, is the name by which Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s economy is most often described. A primitive form was found in the anarchy in the wake of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s atomic bombing, but by 2020 it was written into the document that would become Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s postwar constitution.\n Prior to the Atomic War, Vekllei was a closed, protectionist market under rule of a monarchy puppeted by a military junta. A backwards and quaint country for much of its 20th century, there is no period in Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s history which we might describe as \u0026ldquo;industrial capitalism\u0026rdquo;. It is in this context, in the ashes of the Atomic War and under British occupation, that we can sympathise with the barter economy that would eventually modernise into the Bureau System, a thoroughly unique economic ideology in the world today.\n  What makes the Bureau System unique? Simply that, in common contexts, no money exists in Vekllei whatsoever. This is moneylessness in spirit, too \u0026ndash; there are no currency substitutes, be they labour vouchers or ration systems. This initial fact of life and symptom of destitution is now codified and vigorously defended by the Vekllei state, making the country the only example of a moneyless state of its size in the world.\nThe abolition of currency is allowed by two facts:\n1. A general post-scarcity and surplus of goods.  2. The inefficiencies of a profitless market compensated by the total abolition of waged labour/labour costs. The function fo Vekllei   1.2. Principles The economy informs the high standard of living, but also influences architecture, culture and even the Vekllei person himself. In the context of the Vekllei participist economy, even the notions of manhood and womanhood are reorganised around the basic principles of the economy, which are themselves symptoms of Vekllei‚Äôs history, landscape and culture.\nThe core principles of Vekllei‚Äôs parecon, usually identified by name as petticoat society, are as follows:\n Self-management and self-interest through Sundress Municipalism. Classification of property as an independent social organ, like nature. Abolishment of currency and currency-substitutes. Participatory employment. Economic feminisation.  1.3. Culture Most unusual is Vekllei‚Äôs cultural phantom of property and its absence in business and the home. That is not to indicate a tendency of either private or shared commodity, but rather an absence of commodity altogether ‚Äî a fiscal kingdom divorced entirely from neighbouring notions of property, usurped instead by a common understanding of cityscape and objects alike as products of nature, capable neither of possessing or communalising it, codified mostly by a cultural intuition that forms one part of the Vekllei idea of ‚Äòownership‚Äô.\nYes, these people do not recognise property in their domestic lives, nor do they carry with them any currency or currency-substitute (labour vouchers, crediting systems, etc.) ‚Äî but to describe the economic function of society as simply utopian in the fashion of 19th century fiction-writers would be misleading. Vekllei is a miracle produced in the intersection of culture and power that have determined national priority since the First Atomic War. Vekllei is not a blueprint or mathematical template, and appears to be so far irreproducible abroad. This could be because of any or all of the following:\n  Vekllei is perhaps the most highly concentrated country of its size on Earth ‚Äî 80 percent of the 20 millions that call it home are located in the wide urban region referred to as the Capital and the city-state of Vekllei. Indeed, domestically the entire inhabited coastline is considered to be part of one large, singular city community. Vekllei was devastated entirely by the First Atomic War, which extinguished the protectionist Denoisesn regime and left the urban centres bare of infrastructure, allowing architects and urban planners to implement a so-called ‚Äògarden city‚Äô design in the principle of traditional Vekllei spiritualism. Vekllei does not suffer from internal factionalism of the other great powers, and is ethnically and culturally homogenous. The modern Vekllei economy bypassed liberalisation of trade entirely through its monarchical-authoritarian-utopian progression, and has no nostalgia for either currency or real market economics. Most crucially, the last fifty years of advanced robotics has essentially relegated vast swaths of the labour of the majority of her workforce as unnecessary, or comfortable. Automation is not universal, and so all people must work in fairness, but society has reorganised around professional hierarchies where every person casts their lot in at the lowest rung ‚Äî essentially, in theory, alleviating work as anything other than hobby.  So Vekllei has an unusual system that is desperate to consume work-hours. It is labour-intensive where wanted, alleviated by industrial machinery where preferred, and completely automated where necessary.   2. Petticoat Socialism 3.

Although similar in some ways to nature reserves or national parks, their legal status in Vekllei is somewhat more complex; although de facto part of the country, the government does not recognise human sovereignty over these regions, a feature inherited from Upen. Boroughs, or Baras, are administrative regions in Vekllei named for their largest population centres. They form the basic subdivision of Vekllei territory and also constitute voting regions in the electoral system. Provinces, or Piousvincinia, are the territories in Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s possession outside of the Home Islands.

Its name implies a connection between the physical landscape of the Miyatvousi area and the spirit world.\nHistory  All pools, under the dormant skin of the Earth, lead to other realms.\n \u0026ndash; Verse 112, God Saga, 11th Century\nAlthough Miyatvousi has been recognised as a significant cultural site in Upen, the borough housed no major settlements until the formal incorporation of the town of Miyatvousi into the eastern dominion of the Atlantic Junta in the 17th Century. Previously, the land was inhabited by minor agricultural communities, most tending to livestock. Cultural artefacts found in the borough suggest human settlement may date back to the 10th Century, but by the end of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Middle Period the borough was regarded as an empty Spirit Land.\nIn Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Late Period, the town of Miyatvousi remained small and agricultural, and was considered an insignificant settlement.\nPostwar Development Shortly after independence in the postwar period, Miyatvousi was surveyed by the Electric Company of Vekllei (now Magma-Electric Commission of Vekllei/Thunderburo) for its proximity to exploitable geothermal sites. In 2025, construction began on what is now the sprawling Miyatvousi Magma-Electric Power \u0026amp; Flash Plant, which began operation in 2029 and was expanded with several satellite wells and turbine plants in the the subsequent decades.\nThe city of Miyatvousi has since become a major so-called \u0026ldquo;Magma Town\u0026rdquo; with a growing population employed directly by the M.E.C.\nThe town of Poka, in the south of the borough, was the setting of the popular Six Rings film franchise, and is a minor domestic tourist attraction.\nThe borough is now a major contributor of lamb towards Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s food pool, and is home to several agricultural shows throughout its villages and townships each year.\nGeography Miyatvousi is sparsely populated and highly volcanic, and the majority of its land-area is characterised by flower-tundras, geysers, steam pools and other geological phenomena. Its largest settlements are in the east of the borough, with its west dominated by the Miyatvouosi-Lavavik Crown Lands.\nMiyatvousi\u0026rsquo;s Gismavik Dome is one of the largest dormant volcanoes in Vekllei, and is constantly monitored by the Volcanoes Bureau and Geological Survey for shifts in volcanic activity.

Situated on the sloping north face of the Vekllei Glacier Highlands, the borough is home to several outlet glaciers flowing out of Vatnayoskusl\u0026rsquo;s ice cap.\nTroll is sparsely-populated, and only includes the minor town of Troll and several smaller informal settlements. It is also highly volcanic, and home to the Houismey volcano and dozens of hotspots and mineral springs.\nEtymology Trolls are human-sized creatures with rough grey skin and black eyes described by Vekllei sagas. They live in mountains and glaciers, where they hide in caves. If they are caught in daylight, they turn to stone. According to the sagas, the bodies of trolls eventually became the drumlins that litter Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s mossy plains.\nPer the legends of the sagas, the borough of Troll was the site of a troll city, which was destroyed by lava spirits. This fact contributed to its naming upon its incorporation in the early 19th Century.\nHistory  Of course I\u0026rsquo;ve met a troll. It was one of the nicest creatures I\u0026rsquo;ve ever met.\n \u0026ndash; Tzipora Desmoisnes\nAlthough Troll has a signicant cultural history within Vekllei, it is a relatively recent borough. The town of Troll received a trading license in 1823, which is considered its founding as a borough. Little is recorded about its settlement prior to its incorporation, but it is known that nomadic Algic Vekllei had remained in the area for hundreds, if not thousands of years prior.\nAlthough an important cultural site in Upen, the area around Troll is highly volcanic and spiritually complicated, and its status as isolated, resource-poor land prevented permanent settlement for most of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s history.\nPostwar Development Troll has overall shrunk in population since the war, when many of its able-bodied adults moved to the urban coasts in search of employment. Since the late 2050s, the borough has seen a minor revitalisation after the establishment of the Vekllei Highlands Bullet Train, which links it to the larger boroughs on the coast. The economic changes under floral society have also benefited rural boroughs like Troll, since industry is less dependent on proximity to business.\nIn 2036, a major eruption from the Houismeyvik volcano disrupted air travel in Vekllei and Western Europe for eighteen days.\nGeography Troll is situated in the heart of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s volcanic highlands, surrounded by minor glaciers and meltwater rivers. It is an extraordinarily pretty borough, and is a place of dramatic hues that shift with the landscape. From its main population centre, the town of Troll, the Vatnayoskusl Glacier is visible. Its water is some of the cleanest in the world, and highly prized overseas as a health tonic.\nHouismey Volcano The Houismey Volcano, called Houismeyvik in Vekllei, is a basaltic volcano located to the north-west of an outlet glacier called Vosmaspesteh. It is a subglacial volcano situated underneath the surface, and the intersection of magma and meltwater causes phreatomagmatic explosions that can trigger eruptions. It is one of the most active volcanoes in Vekllei, though the size of its eruptions remain small.\nTroll National Park The Troll National Park is one of seventy-two national parks in Vekllei. As a National Park, rather than a Crown Land, it is designed for human visitation and operated by Parks of Vekllei. It is located in the southwest of the borough, and its facilities include boardwalks, rest stops, and hiking trails. It is also the end point of the Vatnayoskusl Track, an extreme hiking trail that crosses the glacier.\nTroll Lava Fields The Troll Lava Fields are a series of flat extinguished lava flows, which are the site of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s last troll city. They can be found north of Houismeyvik, and are part of the Troll Crown Land and Troll National Park. Although they are well-known within Vekllei, they are considered a site desecrated by the spirits and most visitors to the area are from overseas.\nInfrastructure Troll is a minor borough that is mostly resource-poor. Its major contribution to the coasts is its abundance of clean fresh water that flows out of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s largest glacier, Vatnayoskusl. Although little of the glacier itself is located in Troll, most of its rivers and outlet glaciers flow through the borough, and so Troll\u0026rsquo;s largest industries are supported by the Hydroburo\u0026rsquo;s vested concerns in the area.\nTroll High-Speed Rail Depot As a midpoint of the Vekllei Highlands Bullet Train, an auxiliary bullet train depot and maintenance yard was established in the town of Troll. As the final developed borough before the expansive Vatnayoskusl Glacier, the maintenance yard is situated well to repair trains damaged by ice and water.\nVekllei Geological Survey Station The Volcanoes Bureau and Geological Survey monitor volcanic activity in Vekllei, and have several minor research outposts established outside of and within Troll\u0026rsquo;s glacial territory. The borough\u0026rsquo;s vicinity to the Houismey volcano is of particular interest, and contributes to Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s ongoing research into seismic activity in Vekllei.\nTroll Water Treatment Plant Troll\u0026rsquo;s location at the base of the Vatnayoskusl Glacier makes it a strategic site for the processing of freshwater runoff, which feeds Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s residential water systems. In 2066, the Troll Water Treatment Plant was established to support ageing plants in Voya Voya and Guisimaya. The Troll Water Treatment Plant is operated by the Water Commission of Vekllei (Hydroburo).\nTowns  Troll Vatnayoskusl Troll-Misya   Posts  Roadside Picnic VNR Orange    ","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/troll/","title":"Troll"},{"content":" .markdown a { color: var(--color-teal); } .markdown a.anchor { color: var(--color-teal); }  Tzipora Desmoisnes ü¶©  CHARACTER  Documents ‚ùñ This article is about a character who lives in Vekllei  1. Overview Introduction Tzipora Desmoisnes (also Zelda lo Ula de Helette Desmoisnes, born May 5 2047) is a Vekllei Gregori Baby and librarian, and is the character utopia of the Petticoat Project. Born to artist and political activist Mette Sumoisnesn and an unknown father, the family moved to Colombia when Tzipora was six months old. Her return to Vekllei as a teen-ager would mark her integration into Vekllei society and her diagnosis as Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s first victim of Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome.\nTzipora is characterised by her intense disposition and conservative tastes, informed in part by her youth in Colombia and the United States. Although she is naturally self-sustaining and independent, she dearly loves her adoptive father Baron Desmoisnes and family friend Ayn Rumouisen, and holds affectionate, close relationships with those important to her.\n   Tzipora struggles with shell-shock, which interferes with her sleep and is spurred by several triggers, including large dogs and lying on her chest. Her nervous behaviour manifests in various tics, most obviously pulling and rubbing of her clothes and nose. She is relatively unknown in Vekllei, except as an occasional medical curiosity, but is somewhat renowned internationally as the oldest surviving Gregori Baby.\nAfter the American invasion of Colombia in 2057, Mette paid an education broker several thousands of pesos to arrange Tzipora‚Äôs education in California. Although Tzipora would graduate in 2061, she had lost contact with her mother and had lapsed on her education visa. Without an allowance and barred from legitimate work, she moved to Utah the same year in search of income.\nAfter finding work as a maid and residence at a women‚Äôs shelter, Tzipora witnesses to much of the industrial unrest in Utah in the early 2060s. After being threatened and nearly murdered by strikebreakers for her tacit association with the United Mine Workers, at that time an illegal organisation, she met Baron Desmoisnes, an agent of the Vekllei Americas Bureau at National Intelligence. In 2063, she would flee Utah under his advice and return to Vekllei as an expatriated citizen.\nSince arriving in Vekllei at the age of 16, Tzipora has received two doctorates from Montre University and currently works as a community librarian in the small Montre village of Montre-Lola, where she is well-loved.\n2. Early Life Birth in Ro Mette Sumoisnesn Mette became pregnant aged 22 during her revival as an underground sculpture artist. Unsure of whether she was ready to raise a child, she later returned home to her family home for the first time in six years on the advice of her friends. The following Autumn, Tzipora was born.\nShe was delivered at the Ro Maternity Clinic without a father, since Mette was involved with several partners at the time.\nChildhood in Colombia 3.

Click here to see it as a post.   A New Style of Utopia I write introspectively about the project sometimes, as a means by which I consider what I\u0026rsquo;m doing and where my unconscious is leading me with this project. I have the instinct of someone who is over-educated and self-obsessed; someone who went to university, fell for the farce of serious media criticism, and failed to see that all media theorists are basically freaks. And there is a small truth buried in that hyperbole: it does in fact require a certain dysfunction to write books about the study of anime or television. You can become too close to something.\nUtopie concr√®te, or \u0026lsquo;concrete utopia,\u0026rsquo; is my phrase for how I work. I saw parallels with the manifesto of musique concr√®te, as described by Pierre Schaeffer:\n Instead of notating musical ideas on paper with the symbols of solf√®ge and entrusting their realisation to well-known instruments, the question was to collect concrete sounds, wherever they came from, and to abstract the musical values they were potentially containing.\n Utopianism is much the same; it distills the concrete sentiment, concerns, and futures of a time and place and reproduces them in abstract in fiction. In a very straightforward way, my work (Vekllei, so-called) is an abstraction of real people, events, and things.\nIt also refers to the \u0026ldquo;feeling\u0026rdquo; of Vekllei, in a transcendental fashion. Utopianism is associated with very specific, loaded conceptions of perfection \u0026mdash; cleanliness, symmetry, peacefulness, goodness, and impossibility. Vekllei is not any of these things consistently; it is like the raw concrete used in b√©ton brut, and like raw concrete it discolours, weathers and crumbles in its exposure to reality and the march of time. You can see the formwork and imperfections in its product \u0026mdash; not as a result of sloppy workmanship or carelessness, but because those things are beautiful; utopian in their own right.\nAt the risk of disfiguring these notes into a manifesto, the principles of utopie concr√®te might look something like this.\nPrinciples of UTOPIE CONCR√àTE ‚ñ†  All things have dignity All things get dirty You must love it  To explain further:\n All things have dignity. You must take your \u0026ldquo;raw utopia\u0026rdquo; seriously \u0026mdash; it has to be honest. In this sense, you must always aim to do your best for it. Consider your landscape and give your characters the respect you would anyone. If you dishonour them through sloppy work, you should feel embarrassed.¬† All things get dirty. In order to \u0026lsquo;consider your landscape\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;respect your characters,\u0026rsquo; you must also recognise that these things need to live independently from your control. The activity of your utopia is what makes it alive, and also what makes it imperfect. Recognise the imperfections and celebrate them.¬† You must love it. Utopias are very thoughtful and considered, but they can\u0026rsquo;t be intellectual. It must be intuitive \u0026mdash; follow your heart.  UTOPIE CONCR√àTE ‚ñ† with Vekllei Characteristics You already have the tools to create your concrete utopia \u0026mdash; you just need to act on it. I have acted, and what has surfaced reveals a great deal about me, how I think and process the world, my anger and prejudices, my hopes and affections, and the pettiest of petty material interests.\nHayao Miyazaki, a great artist I admire deeply, was asked why his films starred heroines. He said:\n At first, I thought \u0026ldquo;this is no longer the era of men\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; But after ten years, I grew tired of saying that. I just say \u0026ldquo;because I like women.\u0026rdquo; That has more reality.\n I mostly draw women, and there is not much good reason for it other than I like women.\nI have said previously I\u0026rsquo;m deeply uncomfortable with the conceptual objectification of women, and the shallowness of girl-caricatures. Yet, when asked why my cast of characters are mostly women, I can only say that I like drawing women. That\u0026rsquo;s very revealing of the hypocritical discrepancy between essay rhetoric and my body of work. I try and give my characters dignity, but I also draw women and girls because they might look more interesting in a certain profession, or have better options for their clothes. Where is the dignity in being reproduced for how you appear in a picture? We can\u0026rsquo;t mistake \u0026ldquo;drawing women\u0026rdquo; for \u0026ldquo;representation of women.\u0026rdquo; This is a failing on my part.\nBut I also think that Tzipora, the most egregious and unusual example of \u0026ldquo;using the appearance of women\u0026rdquo; in my project, is not much of a woman at all. She carries my anger, my obsessiveness, and lives my fantasy of a meaningful life. She is quite explicitly an author surrogate, although with a life of her own. She is also not supposed to be an authentic depiction of the experience of any woman \u0026mdash; she is in fact closer to an anti-woman. She is so tomboyish, obsessive, and neurotic, that it\u0026rsquo;s hard to use her to explore conventional literary interests in \u0026lsquo;womanhood.\u0026rsquo; Thank goodness for that \u0026mdash; it\u0026rsquo;s not my place.\nCreating Vekllei is my way of processing the goings-on of the world, and my lived experience day-to-day. In this sense, I prefer the clothes and appearance of women, and so in my utopia I draw women.\nThis is one of the interesting contradictions of utopianism. It is inherently egoistic, and can always be traced cleanly to the total worldview and personality of its author. But like most fiction, authors are eager to give life to their people and places, and would rather you not glimpse the man behind the curtain. Vekllei is fiction \u0026mdash; Tzipora is a girl, and lives in Vekllei. Vekllei is also a utopia \u0026mdash; Tzipora is me, and lives in my hopes, dreams, and anxieties. The contradiction is muted until authors start acting like the former is not a result of the latter, and that my personal experience does not affect who and what is depicted in Vekllei. This is true of all fiction \u0026mdash; so let us not pretend cuteness is not a female burden, and my desire to draw nice clothes and interesting hairstyles is not an altruistic representation of women, no matter how well-intentioned my depictions may be.\nThis conversation is important only because Vekllei is important (to me), and the principles of utopie concr√®te are worth upholding \u0026mdash; all things must have dignity.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/newsdesk/essays/utopie/","title":"Utopie Concr√®te"},{"content":"8.

A dead leaf moving by miracle across still water; an overturned bucket collecting dew along its handle; fern leaves half-curled, young and growing.\n \u0026ndash; City Rivers\nT he borough of Voya Voya is an administrative region in southwest Vekllei, located in the Capital Region north of Coyenstisn and east of Lo. It covers the entire area of Voya Voya, a city of some 450,000 people in the capital\u0026rsquo;s extended metro area renowned for its parkland and green spaces. Voya Voya makes up part of the capital\u0026rsquo;s satellite belt of boroughs, characterised by green space and mixed-use residential planning. Voya Voya is often referred to as the capital\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;garden borough\u0026rdquo; for its density and quality of parkland and forest reserves.\nEtymology Voya Voya is transliterated as \u0026ldquo;Good Good,\u0026rdquo; through in practice is better translated as \u0026ldquo;Good Place,\u0026rdquo; analogous to English towns like \u0026ldquo;Goodwood.\u0026rdquo; It refers to the natural temperate rainforests of its area, much of which are preserved in its parks and in its northern Crown Land. It is only one of a handful of Vekllei cities to use Topyas emphasis through repetition, which has more or less been superseded in modern Vekllei by duplicate consonants.\nHistory  What\u0026rsquo;s that smell? Smell it. It smells like the freshest thing I\u0026rsquo;ve ever smelled.\n \u0026ndash; Tzipora Desmoisnes, after visiting Voya Voya for the first time\nVoya Voya\u0026rsquo;s area originally included several small villages founded in the early Middle Period, which by the 19th Century had developed into satellite suburbs of the industrious capital area. This expansion was encouraged by the Atlantic Junta from the mid-1850s through to the early 1930s, during which Voya Voya tripled in population. By the mid-20th Century, it had become apparent that the sprawling Capital metro area had become overextended, and threatened to link up further with boroughs in Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s interior, beyond the glaciers. A \u0026lsquo;green belt\u0026rsquo; programme was announced in 1956, and saw significant portions of Voya Voya and its nearby boroughs preserved as untouchable forests. During this period, Voya Voya was known mostly as a working-class satellite to the wealthier coastal boroughs of the capital.\nDuring the Atomic War, the area\u0026rsquo;s permanent rainforest was protected from firestorms by the scorched impact craters in the neighbouring boroughs of Coyenstisn and Lava, and nearby Cusi Lake.\nPostwar Development The Atomic War collapsed the capital area, and dramatically reduced the population of Voya Voya\u0026rsquo;s neighbouring boroughs. Although the borough itself did not receive direct strikes, the subsequent fallout and social collapse saw starvation and emigration from the borough throughout occupation and into independence.\nIn the Floral Period, protections first developed by the Junta for Voya Voya\u0026rsquo;s green belt were extended by the Floral Government, including the establishment of a Crown Land in its north and the clearing of rubble and replanting of rainforest throughout its inhabited interior. The architects of early independence reduced the density of the borough dramatically, clearing land for parks that now characterise the city.\nIn 2076, Voya Voya was named Borough of the Year by the Festival Commission, which saw it heavily reported by documentary films and tourism material.\nGeography Voya Voya is flat and low-lying, though its border extends to the dramatic hills of the southern Thanveler Glacier. It is cool and wet, and has large areas of temperate rainforest typical of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s southern coast. Rainforest flora are also found in the city of Voya Voya, where tree ferns grow in alleys and in roundabouts. The city itself is medium-rise, like much of the capital, but checkered into planned areas of habitation and parkland. Aqueducts carrying water from the Hydroburo collectors in Thanveler criss-cross its streets and parks.\nCrown Land Voya Voya\u0026rsquo;s Crown Land is an area of forbidden rainforest north of the city area, and was officially struck from Floral Government sovereignty in 2025. It remains a densely forested area belonging to the Land Sovereign, and has tremendous influence on both the culture and composition of the city.\nCusi Lake Cusi Lake is a natural body of water to Voya Voya\u0026rsquo;s southwest, which has doubled in size since the construction of the Cusi Hydroelectric Dam in 1965. Its area is split between the boroughs of Voya Voya, Lo, Coyenstisn, and Lava. As a controlled lake, it is popular for watercraft and swimming, though is extremely cold throughout the year due to runoff from distant glaciers.\nInfrastructure Although Voya Voya is best known for its parks, it is also highly accessible from the capital, linked by a variety of rail lines including bullet trains to the South Coast, Lonne and Thanveler. It is also the origin of the capital area\u0026rsquo;s aqueduct system, a network of open-air water bridges originating in southern Voya Voya, which were first built in the 19th Century and rebuilt in the 21st. Although tourist infrastructure is sparse, it remains a popular borough for day-trips from coastal hotels, a trip made trivial by the density of the capital\u0026rsquo;s rail network.\nThe Water Commission Aqueduct Pumpworks The Water Commission (Hydroburo) Pumpworks in Voya Voya supplies pressure for aqueducts in the city and its neighbouring boroughs. It pulls water from both Cusi Lake and open aqueducts from Thanveler, and pushes water through an elevated network of bridges across the area. After its elevation, water is pulled by gravity with pressure from water towers. The aqueduct system provides water for all parkland in Voya Voya. The Pumpworks is a large brick/Newda facility on Cusi Lake, and its pumps are powered by on-site geothermal steam wells, as they have for a century. Small railcars called Microsweeps run along the open-air aqueducts to clear blockages and sediment.\nBotanical Gardens of Voya Voya The Voya Voya Botanical Gardens are a complex of green areas covering about 12 city blocks, housing mostly indigenous flora. While the Royal Botanical Gardens in Vekllei Proper feature international gardens sampling every continent on Earth, Voya Voya\u0026rsquo;s Gardens are managed as educational public spaces celebrating local landscapes and rainforest. Its facilities include a fair and parade ground, Newda parks, lakes and ponds, rainforests, and greenhouse infrastructure. The Botanical Gardens are the site of festivals in Voya Voya, and often celebrate live music and theatre.\nHydroburo Aqueduct Beautification Scheme In celebration of 50 years of independence, in 2065 the Hydroburo embarked on an ambitious public art project to celebrate the South Coast\u0026rsquo;s ancient aqueduct network. Coordinated from Voya Voya, the site of the Aqueduct Pumpworks, Voya Voya\u0026rsquo;s aqueducts were embossed with tiled murals over the course of about ten years, and were finally completed in March 2076. Its contruction employed nearly 1,500 artists and locals in its peak. Voya Voya\u0026rsquo;s aqueducts are widely recognised as some of the most beautiful pieces of civic infrastructure in the world.\nAll-Smiles Ice Cream Factory All-Smiles Ice Cream, the second-most consumed brand in Vekllei, are headquartered in Voya Voya.

She wondered where those brides were now.\n \u0026ndash; Ghosts of Taiwan in the Yana Lakehouse\nT he borough of Yana is an administrative region in central Vekllei, located in the far-western Lava region north of Tiyousn and east of Laisiyo. It is named after Yana, a city of some 45,000 people isolated along Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s sparse, moonlike volcanic interior for which the Lava region is named. Yana makes up part of an agro-belt of depopulated boroughs that sit along the Sesmiousvianneh river, which washes rich igneous minerals north to towns downstream. The town of Yana is best known for its proximity to the spectacular molten lava fields common in the area.\nEtymology Yana was the name of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s first spirit ambassador in Upen mythology, who met human farmer Armond Volusksson at the base of Mose, a volcano associated with lava spirits. Although the meeting (as described in the Molten Wind sagas) took place in the present-day borough of Askayaisn, it remains a common Blood Name in the country and was chosen for Yana\u0026rsquo;s settlement to protect it against seismic activity.\nHistory  Yana is very beautiful, yes. It\u0026rsquo;s a very serious place, in the sense that you can feel the volatility of things around you. Out on the coasts, growing up is very different. The weather is better and the cities are bigger; there\u0026rsquo;s more to do. In Yana, it was quite a serious place to grow up, you see. You are in better contact with the Earth \u0026ndash; not in some abstract sense, but in a very real fear of what it might produce.\n \u0026ndash; Ayn Rumouisen\nYana has been inhabited since the 17th Century or so, dated mostly to the erection of the town of Yana\u0026rsquo;s community hall in 1644. Like many of its neighbouring boroughs, its initial settlement was spurred by an interest in its mineral-rich volcanic soil, which offered good growing for staple Vekllei foods like wheat and potatoes.\nIn 1856, the Beri Railroad Bridge was constructed across Sesmiousvianneh river, which allowed for easy export to Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s wealthy coastal communities. The structure operated for nearly a hundred years, until the wooden bridge was washed away in 1948 by heavy rains, taking Locomotive No. 6004 and its engineers with it.\n2006 Flood Disaster In May 2006, heavy rains over the Skusme glacier caused the Sesmiousvianneh river to swell over its banks and flood the town of Beri, washing away several homes and a mill. Nearly 150 people died as their homes were swept away, making it the largest flooding disaster in recent Vekllei memory, and is remembered each year across all towns of the borough.\nPostwar Development During the Floral Period, Yana was marked by the Vekllei Beautification Bureau as a successful example of \u0026ldquo;traditional Lava [region] community living and culture,\u0026rdquo; and suggested using it as a blueprint for further development of Lava\u0026rsquo;s isolated and often agricultural villages. The town of Yana was further recognised as Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;10th most beautiful city\u0026rdquo; in the architecture/holiday magazine Alive in 2044.\nGeography The area around Yana is ringed by flower-tundras, though the settlements within it are characterised by low-lying grass plains and cold-weather mosses. Ancient lava flows form striking stone rivers across the interior of the borough, making it among Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s most alien inhabited landscapes. Thermal pools are common, scattered across the landscape like mirrors, and plumes of volcanic steam can be seen from all of its towns.\nDevil\u0026rsquo;s Geysers The Devil\u0026rsquo;s Geysers are a series of four medium-to-small geysers about 20 kilometres outside of the Yana township. The largest of them, Resmiousvizime, erupts every 10 minutes with a spurt of nearly 8 meters. They are surrounded by natural hot springs, which are popular among the locals and celebrated each year in a local festival called Vis Cusmion or \u0026ldquo;Arrival of Steam\u0026rdquo;.\nInfrastructure Yana is an agricultural borough typical of the western Lava Region, but its largest settlement, Yana, has seen its economy diversify in the postwar period to include scientific and industrial research on the applications of its many geothermal features. It has also attracted some attention as a quiet international tourist destination for foreigners eager to see geysers and mineral-pools first-hand.\nYana Lakehouse The Yana loh Ouismaindesdenya (Yana Care Home) is a facility run by the War Bureau of the Royal Commonwealth Armed Forces to rehabilitate and care for veterans returning home from combat. It arranges for both long-term and short-term programmes designed to reintroduce soldiers to civilian life. Some 750 people live on-site for anywhere between six months to five years where they take classes, receive treatment and therapy, and go on excursions throughout the Yana region.\nYana Thunderburo Geothermal Research Plant Outside of Sciff, a small agricultural settlement in Yana\u0026rsquo;s West, lies the Thunderburo Geothermal Research Plant, a complex designed to pioneer emerging geothermal electricity production. Vekllei depends heavily on geothermal electricty for domestic consumption, and so considerable concern is given to advancing the efficiency of the Thunderburo\u0026rsquo;s so-called \u0026ldquo;Magma-Electric Commission\u0026rdquo;. About 250 research staff work out here, most commuting from Sciff or stationed on-site in company apartments.\nTowns  Yana Sciff Beri   Posts  Ghosts of Taiwan in the Yana Lakehouse The Race for Inefficiency A Map of Vekllei ‚Äî 100 Boroughs; 100 Hearts    Notes  Ayn Rumouisen was born in Yana.

Thanks for your understanding. For now, Tzipora and Cobian are complete.  A lthough almost all characters in this project were born in Vekllei, they are of vastly different heritages and backgrounds. A study of modern Vekllei is a study of immigration. Most characters here have swirling ethnic, religious and cultural histories aiding and obscuring their destinies. The character profiles below only gently touch upon the people that make up this world, but should serve as a stop-gap between nothingness and their full articles that will be produced over the coming months.\nCharacters Tzipora (Zelda) Desmoisnes  Fact Sheet     Tzipora lo Ula de Helette Desmoisnes     Birthday May 5th 2047, Lava, Royal Borough of Lava, Vekllei   Nationality Vekllei, Colombian   Spouses None   Children None   Parents Mette Sumoisnesn, unknown father   Education Lola 6th School, Montre National University   Occupation Student, Librarian, Gregori Baby   Military Service Floral Assistant, 2nd Garden Corps, Royal Vekllei Armed Forces   Civilian Awards National Award for Heroism in Local Service (twice)   Sigil Mustard Orchid        Tzipora lo Ula de Helette Desmoisnes is the main character and character utopia of this project. Often called Zelda by her friends, she is the protagonist of Atomic Modern and a significant person within Vekllei. Although born in Vekllei, Tzipora was raised overseas in Colombia and later educated in the United States. It was not until her return to Vekllei in her teen-age years that she was formally diagnosed with Gregori Syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects her ageing and renders her biologically immortal. Since her arrival in Vekllei, she has formed sincere and long-lasting relationships in her homeland, stabilising her life and making her happy.\nAppearance Tzipora is blue-eyed and black-haired of mixed Inuit-Scandinavian and Eastern-European heritage. She has a round head and a big smile, and a skinny frame attributed in part to a childish metabolism retained through Gregori-Heitzfeld Syndrome, from which she suffers. She parts her short hair in the centre and ornaments it with fountain hairpieces, traditional hair loops and floral assemblies depending on the occasion. She is most remembered for her youthful appearance, since she does not age beyond late prepubescence as a consequence of her genetic condition. Despite this, she retains a serious, cultivated manner and alternates disconcertingly between youthful hyperactivity and careful, deliberate physicality.\nShe dresses in conservative fashions and has maintained a consistent taste throughout her life. She has a weakness for loose clothing, particularly buttoned shirts, slacks and skirts of various styles. She is most commonly seen in a pleated white shirt, modest skirt, folded socks and penny loafers.\nPersonality Tzipora is nonconformist by way of ignorance or obstinance depending on the occasion.\nShe is paranoid and conservative, good-natured and austere, with a moral outlook bound by her deepest anxieties and obsessions. She is deeply spiritual and material, fascinated with objects and their history. She has many collections of many things she‚Äôs found. She‚Äôll likely die a Catholic, but has a confrontational relationship with God and no longer attends mass. She does not know if this has pissed Him off, but it‚Äôs working out so far. Maybe that‚Äôs why He made her a homosexual ‚Äî to get back at her. He must have a good sense of humour, if that‚Äôs the case.\nTzipora may be intense and inward-facing, but she can also be disarmingly charming and self-deprecating. She has a good sense of humour. There are not many girls that can so easily reconcile the contradictions between the peculiar and the healthy, the eccentric and the friendly, and the violent and the domestic.

Tzipora and Cobian met during secondary schooling in Vekllei, and remained close throughout the rest of their lives. She is very close with Tzipora, but has tepid relationships with Tzipora\u0026rsquo;s mostly male friendship group out of jealousy and a general distaste for boys. She is rigorously polite in the middle-class sense of the word; formal among strangers, gossipy among friends.\nAppearance Cobian is green-eyed and black-haired, descendent mostly from Inuit-Scandinavian ethnic groups common in Vekllei. She is more Asiatic in appearance than her friend Zelda, and is tall for her age. She styles her long hair in many different ways, most commonly in a bun or braids. She is healthy but inactive, and tans easily without freckling. Cobian is naturally graceful and well-mannered, traits Tzipora is deeply envious of.\nShe dresses in prim, well-maintained clothing courtesy of her despotically hygienic mother, and has a penchant for ironed shirts, pleatless skirts, synthetic hosiery and jewellery she considers befitting a maturing young woman.\nPersonality When Tzipora meets her, Cobian is a figure of sympathy and irritation. She was deeply insecure after old friendships fell apart in the tumultuous transition between middle and secondary schooling. Once she became comfortable around her new friend and matured out of some old insecurities, Cobian revealed herself to be easy-going and friendly, a person of small pretensions and genuine friendship. In her own skin, she makes an excellent conversationalist, charmingly attentive and ready to listen.\nSome people think she\u0026rsquo;s pretentious; she\u0026rsquo;s not pretentious. She likes good food and is highly fashionable in her interests and styles, but Cobian is also deeply empathetic and finds interest in new things via her friends she\u0026rsquo;d never previously thought about. She makes up most of Tzipora\u0026rsquo;s social life, which leaves plenty of space for Zelda\u0026rsquo;s big personality and obsessions. Zelda has a deeply stablising effect on Cobian, rounding out some of her mother\u0026rsquo;s strict legacy through Zelda\u0026rsquo;s androgynous habits and far-fetched fascinations. But Zelda\u0026rsquo;s big personality does not include much talking or grace, and in these deficiencies Cobian\u0026rsquo;s social talent shines.

Overview The National Mint of Vekllei is shrouded in mystery, since its use as a producer of coins in a country without money seems obscure. As is the case in many of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s State Requisites (A.r.), its purpose and structure is both uniquely Vekllei and thoroughly obtuse, two facts addressed here in this article.  T he National Mint of Vekllei, referred to as the Mint or Mint A.r.1 within the country, is sole producer of coins and government bonds in Vekllei, as well as the sole proprietor of its domestic gold bullion reserve. It is a civilian state requisite responsible for physical money supply of Vekllei, which it continues to mint in the moneyless Floral Period as souvenirs (and, internationally, legal tender). It also serves as the primary printing facility for Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Government Bank, the country\u0026rsquo;s Central Bank and regulator of money supply in both Vekllei and Government Crowns.\nThe Mint is among Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s oldest institutions, founded as a successor to the Port of Vekllei Mint in 1386. It is headquartered in the Nation Mint Complex in the Gold District of Vekllei Proper.\nIntroduction History Structure The Mint is an executive government agency directly operated by the Vekllei Government, signalling its responsibility to Vekllei society rather than the Land Sovereign.\nThe National Mint of Vekllei  The Vekllei Government  National Mint of Vekllei  Royal Mail Press  Bulletin of the Mail Materials Manufacturie   Financial Services Bureau Gold Security Bureau  Fraud Investigation Unit Venrouive Gold Sappers HO/NI Gold Detachment          2. Coinage ‚ùñ Read more: The Vekllei Crown  The Royal Mail maintains a constitutionally-bound monopoly on all postage in the country, leaving it the sole provider of universal postage service in Vekllei. Like most State Requisites (A.r.), however, it has substantial international trade and foreign dealings that provide for its common description as a state-owned for-profit enterprise, or public corporation.  U niversal service is, by the glossary of the Mail, truly universal. As mandated by Vekllei law, the Mail provides delivery for all postage material anywhere in the world, or indeed, beyond it. It maintains 6,424 post offices across Vekllei, including its antarctic and peripheral possessions. The Mail\u0026rsquo;s first Lunar Post Office opened in 2059. In addition to its domestic monopoly, the Mail contributes nearly VK‚ù¶2.6 trillion each year towards the Vekllei Government Securities Bureau (the country\u0026rsquo;s sovereign wealth fund) through its international postage and courier services abroad, under the name World Post.\nSince the Mail\u0026rsquo;s Office of Telecommunications is also responsible for all telephones, telegrams and videophones in the country, the Mail\u0026rsquo;s status as a lynchpin of communication is absolute, and heavily protected by the postwar Vekllei constitution.\nVekllei Crowns         Vekllei Crowns minted as of the 21st Century, produced by the Mint as souvenirs | The Vekllei Crown  The Mail aims to provide next-day delivery during weekdays in zero-code (that is to say, Home Island) regions. Overnight delivery is also generally available between Home Islands, Aismious Islands, Kala and the Azores during weekdays. Most Lunar territories are available on Mondays and Fridays, and other territories are available according to the Mail\u0026rsquo;s region table.\nAlthough Vekllei people do not pay to post items, stamps are affixed with coloured squares called chromacodes which are used in the automatic sorting machines common in the country. International Mail uses traditional stamps with price listed, and the Vekllei Crown displayed. Franking is used for tracking and identification.\nGold Bullion Government Crowns Special, commercial and industrial postage is managed within the Postal Service Bureau through special sorting facilities and a dedicated postal network. Regular business postage is funnelled through regular daily service, but hazardous, oversized and dangerous goods are accepted by special Post Offices designed to accept them. The Mail does not provide special services for regular residential or courier delivery.\nThe Mail is best known overseas as the World Post, which offers services for foreign clients and has established itself as one of the Big Four international transnational courier services in the world today. Similar to domestic postal systems in other countries, the World Post offers flat rates for delivery anywhere in the world, priced according to size and weight. In addition, sister company Universal Express offers next-day weekday delivery in certain markets. Most employees of the World Post and Universal Express are foreign workers banking labour-hours for immigration to Vekllei. Unlike domestic service, the World Post and Universal Express use private courier contracts extensively to fulfil orders.\nFinance The Labour Bank of Vekllei2 is easily accessible via the Mail\u0026rsquo;s Financial Services Bureau. Although inaccessible within the country, savings can be withdrawn conditionally upon emigration, and the Mail offers easy access and financial counselling for Vekllei people. Through the Financial Services Bureau, the Mail also offers financial management to immigrant populations with wealth transfer (the phrase for banking of savings and prior income) and Overseas Accounting, commonly used to send money to family abroad.\n3. Operations ‚ùñ Read more: Gold Sappers  As a military organ, the Mail A.r. retains military ranks for its staff, commanded by a Postmaster General and aided by a civilian regulator designed to keep its critical service available to Vekllei people. The Mail\u0026rsquo;s fleet includes dedicated jets, automatic trucks, mail trains, intercity pneumatic systems, vehicle automen, and postmen, all wearing the red and gold colours of the organisation. In total, the Mail delivers nearly 50 million pieces of mail during weekdays.  I t is evident that the services assigned to the Mail by the postwar constitution are of critical importance to the stability of Vekllei society. In addition to being one of the oldest active postal organisations in the world, the Royal Mail of Vekllei is tremendously busy, since physical post has scarcely been displaced by the telephone in the country. Even without the Mail\u0026rsquo;s international postage, domestic mail each day can exceed 12 million pieces \u0026ndash; enough for 1 in 2 people, though commercial mail and periodicals are included.\nAs is typical for critical bureaus in Vekllei, the Mail alleviates the stress of daily service through its dense, vertically-integrated infrastructure aided by automatic (automen vehicles) and permanent fixtures (pneumatic systems and automatic sorting/franking machines). It is precisely this commitment to infrastructure that makes the Mail so visible in daily life, and contributes to its ongoing legacy as Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s oldest running government institution.\nStaff Illustration of Gold Sappers, the Venopor police detachment responsible to the Mint | Gold Sappers  The Mail employs 48,960 people full-time across its various offices, and nearly 200,000 automen in various roles. Although the Mail does retain a staff of postmen and couriers, most urban daily service is now provided by automatic vehicles and sorting, which account for nearly half of the total automen owned by the organisation. Instead, the majority of Mail employees are involved in the running of the organisation \u0026ndash; mostly as clerks, managers, and administrators. Around 10,000 postmen are employed by the Mail in daily delivery, called \u0026ldquo;posties\u0026rdquo;. There are around 8,000 postal routes in the country.\nAlthough at first glance the number of automen dramatically exceeds demand, the total count is misleading \u0026ndash; most automen with the Mail are integrated into the infrastructure of its sorting centres and post offices, and very few are traditionally autonomous robots commonly seen in public in Vekllei. Only about 8,000 automen are employed in physical mail delivery.\nThere are 16,220 post boxes in Vekllei, which are iconic for their red and gold paint and intricate detailing.\nFleet ‚ùñ Read more: The Fairie  The Mail retains a large and diverse fleet of vehicles in regular operations, which, due to their diversity and and expense, have become iconic around the world. From bicycles to space planes, the Mail\u0026rsquo;s fleet of vehicles rivals in diversity postal services three times its size, largely benefitted by Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s obfuscated budgeting system and cultural importance afforded to the organisation.\nThe following table lists company vehicles relevant to regular postal service.\nThe Royal Mail Fleet  Postal Service Bureau  8,000 delivery automen 5,200 motorcycles (mostly Local Electric Model 15 \u0026amp; Phantoms) 2,400 bicycles 2,000 automatic vans 400 mail trucks 31 mail boats (MBR) 20 mail flying boats (Model 54 \u0026ldquo;Fairie\u0026rdquo;) 16 mail helijets (Model RM/Gisma \u0026amp; Record types) 15 mail trains (RM Series/Series 225 EMU) 8 mail trams (Series T6) 2 mail space planes (G.A.

Overview The economy of Vekllei is a sparkling jewel of its crown of contradictions, and totally unique in the world today.  V ekllei language, abbreviated to just Vekllei, has six core sublanguages that are used commonly today. Although they often intersect, these different systems of communication are distinct languages in their own right, used for different purposes in different arenas of communication.\nSystems of Language  Spoken Vekllei, which is everyday spoken language. It draws from two glossaries with different meanings and feelings, called Oa and Loh. Topet, which are logographic characters (occasionally characterised as hieroglyphs). Like other pictographic languages, Topet characters can be broken down into repeating components, called Topotte. Rapotenne, is the traditional logographic language of names. It is much older than Topet, and has more in common with spiritual runes than modern logography. Potenne, lit. ‚ÄúHand-Talk‚Äù, is a sign language that incorporates gestures and signing to add meaning to emotion to spoken language, and occasionally in place of it. Upotenne, lit. ‚ÄúSpirit-Hand-Talk‚Äù, as the recreation of runes in human form, used limitedly in spiritual ritual. Vekllei Semaphore is the codification of colour and shape. Traditionally limited to colour, shape and pattern are now also included in Vekllei Semaphore, in which full sentences can be formed.    Introduction History As an island country, Vekllei is a traditional maritime state dependent on fish stocks and natural resources in its surrounding oceans, primarily the\nVekllei\u0026rsquo;s fledgling kingdom under rule of Simiyo Kehsmiouz successfully positioned the country as an Atlantic trading port and mercantile hub, bringing new wealth to the country and beginning the Era of Rest.\n  6000 BC - 3500 BC, Kalaallisut / Kala, Proto-Quutetast extinct Algic language. 3500 BC - 800 AD, Quutetast, Algic-Aleutian extinct language. 1200 BC - 900 AD, Islandi, Indo-European Scandinavian language. 900 AD - 1600 AD, Topyas (Old Vekllei), fusion dialect of Islandi and Quutetast. 1600 AD - present, Modern Vekllei, evolution of Topyas. Spoken today.   2. Structure The Bureau System A Bureau is the transliteration of the Vekllei word Boreaul, meaning a writing desk. In Vekllei it has evolved to infer a singular labour monopoly of the country (in state speak called \u0026ldquo;masthead chapels;\u0026rdquo; trade unions), either as government State Requisites 1 or private venrouive monopolies 2.\nBureaus can consist of a single company, as is often the case in government departments, or several hundred. In this sense, a private Bureau resembles a central federation trade union, organising companies into industry monopolies that, while legally independent from government affairs, are traditionally expected to cooperate with the democratic processes of the country. Bureaus, as administrators of work in Vekllei, are fundamentally political organs, and the Bureau Secretariat, the legal congress of all bureaus, reports directly to the Prime Ministers of Vekllei.\nWhen we talk about a Bureau, it refers to a Bureau Proper unless otherwise stated. Bureaux Proper are the formal trade organisations of the country, bound to its direction and intention. They coexist with Bureau Minor or \u0026ldquo;Petty Bureaux,\u0026rdquo; which are informal, often provincial or regional, independent from Proper Bureaux, and better resemble free trade unions. The following infosheets describe their differences.\nBureau Proper    Bureau Minor     Senrouive    Venrouive     Bureaus\n Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s international standing Extraterritorial influence Social benefit  Informal Markets 3. Floral Society Moneylessness The Bureau System Property Ownership Place-Metaphysics Sundress Municipalism 4. Currency and Markets T he Vekllei Kroner, or ‚ÄúCrown,‚Äù is hundreds of years old, and Vekllei still operates a mint for currency. At any time, a Vekllei person can write to the National Mint and order a set of coins, like the ones pictured above. So what is going on here?\nAlthough the Kroner has not been used since 2022, after the last village in Stochi returned coinage to the Mint, it continues to exist to this day as a gold-backed currency in the International Market, through which Vekllei trades with other countries. The physical coins, produced mostly as a novelty in the tradition of mayaesdiou (medallions, or small metal pieces commonly collected and given in Vekllei), are a physical coinage of the International Market. The coins also operate as a form of bullion, or wealth reserve, since each coin is worth exactly its face value in gold. Since the International Market is completely closed and independent of the domestic economy, its value is controlled directly by the so-called Government Bank. It is one of the few gold-backed currencies in a developed nation today.\nTo further complicate things, there are actually two different Kroner in Vekllei. There is the Vekllei Kroner, which represents the International Market, but there is also a seperate Government/State Kroner, which is not minted and used only as an investment mechanism, backed by government \u0026ldquo;white bonds\u0026rdquo; which are usually measures of labour-hours or refined materials. It is, in a sense, a fiat currency alongside a gold-backed currency.\nThey exist independently because they are used for two seperate purposes. The Vekllei Kroner is used a wealth reserve and bullion, and also represents the collective wealth of the Vekllei people. Each citizen, in theory, is entitled to an equal share of the Government Bank, although it can only be withdrawn as currency in specific circumstances. Vekllei also holds substantial amounts of foreign currency in the Government Bank and Vekllei Kroner, which is used to invest and stabilise holdings and capital in foreign countries. The Government Kroner, on the other hand, is used as an investment mechanism abroad, usually in support of infrastructure. It is also used to acquire foreign currencies through investment in foreign capital.\nDespite having two currencies, neither the \u0026ldquo;Vekllei Crown\u0026rdquo; or the \u0026ldquo;Government Crown\u0026rdquo; are used in the domestic economy in Vekllei, which is autonomous and not subject to a central bank. So it is that Vekllei‚Äôs currency is both little more than a novelty and essential to the function of the country in a world still ruled by money.\n In the coinage depicted above ‚Äî 8 coins are minted in Vekllei today. They were designed in 2015, in the year of independence. They represent eight core values in the country.\nThe ‚Äúsmall crowns,‚Äù worth 1VK and 10VK respectively, represent fraternity and liberty, two founding elements of the Vekllei constitution. The 50VK coin is plated in silver and has a small ruby inset. Rubies are used to represent energy, in this case, the vitality of the spirits, which dominate Upen and the Vekllei landscape. The 100, 200, 500 and 1,000VK coins represent different landscapes of the country. As a volcanic island nation, the ocean (100) and landscape (200) coins are fairly straightforward. The humanity coin (500) represents the Vekllei people and ancestry ‚Äî note how humans are placed alongside other natural forces. The flower coin (1,000VK) represents the flowers of the country, which are important spiritually and have formed part of the Vekllei identity. Vekllei has the most flowers per capita in the world. The final, larger 10,000VK coin represents the previous seven together, as a total sum of Vekllei landscape and identity.\n Notes   State Requisites, or requoisesiasn amourisocietie (A.r.), for example the Thunderburo\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n State Industries, or societie indastrie (S.A.), like the historic General Reactor\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/society/economy/","title":"Economy"},{"content":"‚ùñ Note from the Editor This article was originally published in October 2019. This article was written shortly after my return from Hong Kong, where I got caught up in the pro-democracy protests and is a broad response to Australian coverage of the ongoing events.  H ong Kong is a loud, bustling jewel of a city. It is perhaps my favourite city in the world. On sweltering days, what sounds like raindrops smack the pavement as hundreds of air-conditioning units drip liquid into the streets below. In North Point, you might as well be fifty years back in time. Thin double-decker trams ding-ding-ding their way through crowded market streets with smells pungent enough to turn your stomach in the humid air. New tower blocks develop a run-down patina in a matter of years. Everyone is shouting, all of the time.\nEnough people have asked me to share my experience in Hong Kong that I‚Äôve decided to get around to doing it. I was reluctant for a few reasons. The first is that I felt I didn‚Äôt have anything particularly profound to say (it recalls white tourists returning home from building a cowshed in Vietnam and describing how seeing poverty really, like, made them grateful). The second was that there are enough Western voices telling us how to feel about police brutality and freedom movements, and I don‚Äôt see how my anecdotes would contribute to anything but further anxiety and sorrow for Hong Kong. I am not some kind of saviour, or for that matter a journalist. I did not do anything good for Hong Kong. I don‚Äôt see how I‚Äôve earned my right to talk about it. So treat this only as a collection of thoughts, influenced and calcified by my time in a wonderful city.\nDo not go to Hong Kong right now unless you‚Äôre willing to get hurt for it. These are not localised outbreaks of violence. In Tsim Sha Tsui, the trendy shopping heart of Hong Kong, I saw a female tourist carried out of a tear smoke plume by her partner. I next saw her laid out several streets away amidst protester paramedics. It can be difficult to tell which places are safe, even when trying to avoid or escape a protest. I had not realised I was across from a besieged police station when I first had a taste of tear smoke. I hadn‚Äôt seen the smoke warning flags or police lights.\nThe night after the events of TST, the police used tear smoke in an underground MTR station. It should not take an expert to realise why using chemical weapons in an enclosed, unventilated space is an escalation of police violence. Quite frankly, considering the scale of the protests and the hostility of the HK riot police, it is only chance that someone hasn‚Äôt been killed (or at least confirmed to be). Hong Kong is a gorgeous, wonderful city, but the risks are obvious and largely unavoidable.\nI recall running with some strangers to the corner of Haiphong and Nathan Road, where an MTR station was still operating, as three busses of riot police arrived and unloaded onto the pavement beside me. The protests on Nathan Road clearly hadn‚Äôt dispersed to their liking. I was there by chance, doing tourist things. They were carrying tear smoke guns and shields. It is very surreal to be surrounded by some of the most valuable commercial real estate in the world, stocked with Tiffany Blue gift boxes and BVLGARI fragrances, only to be racing riot police to the station entrance before the metro shut down. The following night, my hotel in North Point boarded up its doors in preparation of a riot between protesters and pro-Beijing counterprotesters. I hung around for a while, but it seemed the protesters were smart enough to avoid North Point that night. My point is that, after dark, tourist impulses to see sights and enjoy good food will lead you into an escalating civil disturbance that has been ongoing for nearly three months now.\nWhat are we, the world, supposed to do about Hong Kong? Just this week, protesters marched on the U.S. embassy waving American flags. What do they expect the Yanks to do? Appear off-shore with a aircraft carrier as a show of force? Despite the sacrifice of Hong Kongers at home and abroad, the dialogue still seems to be not of Hong Kong and her future, but of China. Even if every demand should be met, the ‚Äútwo systems, one country‚Äù promise will expire in a few decades, and what do we plan to do about it then? Dump more opium into China and demand Hong Kong back?\nDespite my unwavering solidarity with Hong Kongers and their struggle, I find myself reeling from the gloating of our media, on social networks and in print, over the grisly iconography of the protests. Crows and carrion, I say. We don‚Äôt really intend to do anything about it ‚Äî China could perpetrate another massacre and we‚Äôd only wring our hands about the incivility of it all. Who would we sanction the Chinese mainland from? Ourselves? We‚Äôve spent the entire post-war era comfortably offloading our manufacturing into the cheap, exploited labour markets of East Asia. Are we willing to sacrifice our entire manufacturing base over the blood of Hong Kongers?\nJournalists scribble. Social media lurkers like. Politicians wrestle with the reality that our mother country‚Äôs navy is no longer able to stomp about the world anymore. Even America, our World Police, seem to be flexing only their civil service ‚Äî intensifying bureaus and firing up cabinet meetings. So what are we, the world, supposed to do about Hong Kong?\nI watched thousands of Hong Kongers risk livelihoods and safety, only to return to the infantilising paternalism of Western commentary, with loaded notions of Hong Kong as a ‚ÄòWestern pocket‚Äô of Asia, flicking between sympathy theatre and condemnation of Beijing. It seems disingenuous and lurid, and although our free press is more decent about the matter than the Chinese state media could ever be (my Twitter in Hong Kong was sponsored exclusively by Chinese newspapers decrying the violence of protestors), it‚Äôs nonetheless uncomfortable for me to tout my own righteous, democratic superiority when all my morals and all my democracy leave me useless in the face of Chinese hegemony.\nIt‚Äôs left me burnt out and cynical in a way that tear smoke and street fires never could. There is spirit and vigilance in the protests in Hong Kong, but we live in a world of global trade and information overload. Hong Kong is very small place, and the world is very big. Our sympathy does the reality of the situation no good.\nHong Kong is not the tipping point ‚Äî Hong Kong is the first of an ongoing shift of power in our region. There will be more crises like Hong Kong, and our neutered ability to cohesively respond to them without drawing upon our supposed moral superiority is a weakness. China does not understand Western presence and commentary in Hong Kong as a democratic effort ‚Äî it sees it as the legacy of imperial ambition and colonial politics. How much of Australian shock and outcry is about reconciling our own powerlessness with our principles? What good is an opinion of the People‚Äôs Republic or of the HK police? We recognise the distastefulness and incivility of violence, but that does little to influence the imbalance of power spilling blood in Hong Kong right now.\nAwareness is not enough ‚Äî we‚Äôre only a few taps and two clicks away from live minute-by-minute updates of every tear shed in the ongoing protests. There are thousands of journalists in Hong Kong covering every angle of police brutality. And yet the violence goes on‚Ä¶\nThis is my announcement that I am, in fact, useless ‚Äî that for all my Australian pretensions of decency and agency, the situation has changed not one bit. I thus volunteer my honourable withdrawal from the Discourse.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/newsdesk/essays/hongkong/","title":"Hong Kong"},{"content":" .markdown a { color: var(--color-yellow); }  Back to Issues  From the Editor Welcome to the second issue of The Atlantic, closing a quiet month for the Petticoat Project that has ushered in several new beginnings. A comic; a new website; new friends ‚Äî June was a good month. The posts this month departed from the slice-of-life conventions of May, reintroducing maps and infographics to the project. This is a good change! Look forward to more diagrams from Vekllei in future.\nI\u0026rsquo;d also like to thank the contributors to this edition, Hangdog and Chev, for their essays. If you would like to contribute to The Atlantic with writing, art or reviews relevant to the spirit of petticoat ideology, please contact Hobart at melonkony@icloud.com before the 31st of July.\nThank you for supporting Vekllei, and I hope you find value in this bulletin.\nHobart Phillips Enjoy ‚Äî Ê•Ω„Åó„Çì„Åß\n I. News \u0026amp; Announcements  The postcard set for patrons is (just about) complete and awaiting the printers. I‚Äôll contact patrons with a lifetime pledge of $20 or above for shipping addresses, and any patron who wants to make up the rest of their $20 for a set is welcome to do so. The Studio MillMint site is still under renovation. A lot of progress has been made in June, including a timeline page and the infrastructure required for a wiki and blog, but I‚Äôve got so much going on at the moment that the site‚Äôs been relegated to ‚Äúwhenever there is time‚Äù. The comic has started in one form or another. It‚Äôs uni-related for now. Very soon I hope to be publishing storyboards of the ‚Äúreal deal‚Äù for patrons. Hobart\u0026rsquo;s uni break has started. Nice. Thank you always, patrons, for your continued support. It makes me feel loved, and lets me afford things like the postcards.   II. Tzipora-watch June 15th is Cobian‚Äôs birthday. It was on this day that Tzipora and Cobian first introduced themselves to each other, after Cobian‚Äôs ill-fated sweet sixteenth birthday party. Cobian was so struck with affection towards Tzipora and her friendliness that she was invited to a sleepover the following weekend.\n III. Vekllei Fact of the Month You might be aware that puffins are Vekllei‚Äôs national bird ‚Äî but did you know that some people keep them as pets? In coastal fishing towns, puffins make good friends. They‚Äôre curious, unafraid birds that keep their ‚Äúpufflings\u0026quot; safe in burrows underground. Vekllei has the largest population of Atlantic Puffins in the world. They‚Äôre also rather tasty!\n IV. WordBook Fiousmanyiosn ‚Äî ‚Äúfriendly architecture‚Äù. This is a Newda term that describes architecture friendly to its surrounds. ‚ÄúFriendly,‚Äù here, means to integrate and socialise with a structure‚Äôs surrounds, by employing local materials and styles. It can also be ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù in its purpose ‚Äî to provide a foundational service to a community, something important to cultural fabric. In this sense, Fiousmanyiosn refers to both a materials principle and cultural architecture.\n V. The Bulletin What is This Project? üìñ Published 30th June 2020 | Read here.\nWhat is Vekllei?\nHi, I‚Äôm Hobart and I write and draw Vekllei at Studio MillMint.\nThis is a pretty complex project. Not just complex insofar as there‚Äôs a lot to read about it, but that it uses concepts and terminology you might not be familiar with if this is your first time around utopian fiction.\nSo Vekllei is a utopia ‚Äî what does this mean? It‚Äôs latin for ‚Äúno place,‚Äù and I use that literally. Vekllei, in a literal sense, cannot exist. Not because I think it could never have existed, or that some part of it is completely unreasonable, or it breaks the laws of physics ‚Äî but because it exists in a certain place and time that is just isn‚Äôt replicable. It‚Äôs all built from the ground up.\nVekllei is a very good place to live, but it is not perfect. Utopia does not mean ‚Äúperfect place‚Äù. Utopia is a form of social dreaming, much like worldbuilding, linked to the values and priorities of its author. In utopian studies, ‚Äúutopia‚Äù is usually broken down further:\n Eutopia ‚Äî ‚Äúgood place‚Äù Dystopia ‚Äî ‚Äúbad place‚Äù  Note that both form a part of the ‚Äúutopia‚Äù ‚Äî this is appropriate, since Vekllei is grounded in a social realism that acknowledges the good and bad parts of life. Indeed, they are inseparable ‚Äî you cannot have the light without the dark. Obviously, in my eyes, Vekllei is very much a eutopia. You can read more about Vekllei (the country) by clicking here.\nThere are three parts to my ‚Äúsocial dreaming‚Äù:\n Landscape ‚Äî the world and country of Vekllei. When you think of ‚Äúutopia,‚Äù this is it ‚Äî shining modernist cities against striking landscapes. Character ‚Äî not all social dreaming takes place in spaces. Some of it is built around experiences, objects and relationships. Tzipora is a ‚Äúcharacter utopia‚Äù in the sense that she represents a utopian life experience, full of stories good and bad. Author ‚Äî Vekllei is a representation of the problems of my life, as a form of escapism. A lot of my posts here reflect dissatisfactions and displacements in my own life ‚Äî consumer society, commodification of childhood, wage labour, postmodernism, etc. I‚Äôm very much a part of this utopian dialectic.  Let‚Äôs run through some of the common queries and misunderstandings about Vekllei\nWho are you? A Tasmanian illustrator.\nYou‚Äôre not Japanese? „ÅäÂâç„ÅØ„ÇÇ„ÅÜÊ≠ª„Çì„Åß„ÅÑ„Çã\nWhy is Vekllei a utopia? It makes me feel better about my life and the world. It‚Äôs escapism; it‚Äôs a dream.\nIt‚Äôs a bit cringe to grandstand your political beliefs, doncha think? Vekllei is a personal utopia. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm selling. At least you‚Äôre getting good opinions.\nWhere‚Äôs the tension if it‚Äôs perfect? Vekllei is very cynical and tragic in places. Utopia is just a reflection of the author, good and bad.\nIs there a novel? A story? A comic? I‚Äôm working on a comic right now. I‚Äôm pretty much working on Vekllei full-time so I‚Äôm hoping to announce it soon. I‚Äôve got a lot of different Vekllei projects going.\nWhere is Vekllei? Iceland.\nWhy does Vekllei look Japanese? Vekllei is like a country of Scandinavians speaking French with an Aussie accent in Sh≈çwa era Japan/Maoist China/Taiwan etc. Vekllei looks however I imagine utopia looks.\nHow does that make sense? Why can‚Äôt it just be cool?\nIs your alt-history thought out? Vekllei‚Äôs history is whatever I need it to be. I‚Äôm always trying to be realistic, but it‚Äôs all worked backwards from the setting. I‚Äôm not really ‚Äúworldbuilding‚Äù in a typical sense. Very little of it is published, most of it is retrieved on request. Just ask if you have questions.\nIs Vekllei communist? No.\nBut Vekllei calls itself ‚Äúpetticoat socialist‚Äù. Vekllei is set in a culture of Marxist revivalism in the 50s and 60s. A lot of Vekllei‚Äôs lexicon is set in that context. Vekllei is a decentralised democracy that doesn‚Äôt use money. It‚Äôs a sort of participatory economy.\nWhy the \u0026ldquo;petticoat\u0026rdquo;? Vekllei is a female country. Womanhood is decommodified. It\u0026rsquo;s maternal, social and friendly where socialist rhetoric is masculine, technocratic and progressive.\nWho is Zelda? Zelda is another name for Tzipora. She has two names specifically to confuse you.\nWhat is the ‚Äúbulletin‚Äù? I publish the Atlantic Bulletin once a month via email. It‚Äôs got the month‚Äôs posts in it as well as facts and tidbits from Vekllei. DM me an email if you want to join.\n Village Map of Montre-Lola üìñ Published 29th June 2020 | Read here.\nThe village of Montre-Lola is home to about 400 people in its entirety, a stone‚Äôs throw from the Aisyo borough. Each morning, however, the population swells as 300 children from tiny villages in both Aisyo and Montre take a fast tram to the Montre-Lola Area School No. 2, a district school raising all ages of local youth.\nLike many Vekllei villages, Montre-Lola‚Äôs history is complex and has origin stories in both viking-inuit settlement as well as less sentimental government programmes that flourished after the atomic war. By historical accounts, Montre-Lola has been inhabited since at least 1500CE. By contemporaneous records, however, it was established as a village in land reform during the 1960s and revitalised by the building of the area school in 2057. Montre-Lola features many civic objects common to Vekllei villages ‚Äî a nondenominational place of worship (in this case, a historical Catholic church), a constabulary, a doctor, an auto/tractor pool, a general store, a station platform, and a village hall. A map of the village centre is dominated by the Area School, built in an Edunewda style, which features many new facilities that distinguish it from smaller, 20th-century schools. It‚Äôs a good place to grow up; where farmland and earnest modernity collide.\n Montre-Lola is most relevant as the residence of Tzipora Desmoisnes, the world‚Äôs oldest person and one of the first people to be diagnosed with Gregori-Heitzfeld Syndrome. She works as a librarian in both the Montre-Lola Area School and the Montre-Lola Library \u0026amp; Archives, spending most of her 12-hour workday in either of these institutions. She commutes via fast trams, which arrive automatically at the two platforms in Montre-Lola every half-hour and continue out into the surrounding farms. This means that, if she sets her watch right, she can step outside her front door and arrive at the school library in under ten minutes. This journey is marked in red on the map above.\n Dominated by farmland, Montre-Lola is communal and more traditionally ‚Äòanarchist‚Äô in flavour than Vekllei‚Äôs urban boroughs, which are obscured by convenience. As charming as it is suffocating, the community is very close-knit and made up of all sorts ‚Äî smart educated young men and women sent from Montre to teach, as well as farming families that have resided here for centuries. Life moves slower and people know each other. When the school hosts its cross-country race each year, nearly every person in the village is out to watch it. After all, it takes a village to raise a child.\n The Vekllei Crown: coins of a moneyless country üìñ Published 24th June 2020 | Read here.\nVekllei, legendarily, does not use circulate currency. Goods and services are moved and offered arbitrarily, provided amply in abundance. Anything that is not abundant is manufactured and distributed directly under the control of a bureau, which is a trade organ responsible to the affairs of the country. At no point do coins or paper currency change hands in the day-to-day affairs of the country.\nIn this sense, Vekllei is usually described as ‚Äúmoneyless‚Äù ‚Äî yet it does in fact have a currency. The Vekllei Kroner, or ‚ÄúCrown,‚Äù is hundreds of years old, and Vekllei still operates a mint for currency. At any time, a Vekllei person can write to the National Mint and order a set of coins, like the ones pictured above. So what is going on here?\nAlthough the Kroner has not been used since 2022, after the last village in Stochi returned coinage to the Mint, it continues to exist to this day as a gold-backed currency in the International Market, through which Vekllei trades with other countries. The physical coins, produced mostly as a novelty in the tradition of mayaesdiou (medallions, or small metal pieces commonly collected and given in Vekllei), are a physical coinage of the International Market. The coins also operate as a form of bullion, or wealth reserve, since each coin is worth exactly its face value in gold. Since the International Market is completely closed and independent of the domestic economy, its value is controlled directly by the so-called Government Bank. It is one of the few gold-backed currencies in a developed nation today.\nTo further complicate things, there are actually two different Kroner in Vekllei. There is the Vekllei Kroner, which represents the International Market, but there is also a seperate Government/State Kroner, which is not minted and used only as an investment mechanism, backed by government \u0026ldquo;white bonds\u0026rdquo; which are usually measures of labour-hours or refined materials. It is, in a sense, a fiat currency alongside a gold-backed currency.\nThey exist independently because they are used for two seperate purposes. The Vekllei Kroner is used a wealth reserve and bullion, and also represents the collective wealth of the Vekllei people. Each citizen, in theory, is entitled to an equal share of the Government Bank, although it can only be withdrawn as currency in specific circumstances. Vekllei also holds substantial amounts of foreign currency in the Government Bank and Vekllei Kroner, which is used to invest and stabilise holdings and capital in foreign countries. The Government Kroner, on the other hand, is used as an investment mechanism abroad, usually in support of infrastructure. It is also used to acquire foreign currencies through investment in foreign capital.\nDespite having two currencies, neither the \u0026ldquo;Vekllei Crown\u0026rdquo; or the \u0026ldquo;Government Crown\u0026rdquo; are used in the domestic economy in Vekllei, which is autonomous and not subject to a central bank. So it is that Vekllei‚Äôs currency is both little more than a novelty and essential to the function of the country in a world still ruled by money.\n In the coinage depicted above ‚Äî 8 coins are minted in Vekllei today. They were designed in 2015, in the year of independence. They represent eight core values in the country.\n  The ‚Äúsmall crowns,‚Äù worth 1VK and 10VK respectively, represent fraternity and liberty, two founding elements of the Vekllei constitution. The 50VK coin is plated in silver and has a small ruby inset. Rubies are used to represent energy, in this case, the vitality of the spirits, which dominate Upen and the Vekllei landscape. The 100, 200, 500 and 1,000VK coins represent different landscapes of the country. As a volcanic island nation, the ocean (100) and landscape (200) coins are fairly straightforward. The humanity coin (500) represents the Vekllei people and ancestry ‚Äî note how humans are placed alongside other natural forces. The flower coin (1,000VK) represents the flowers of the country, which are important spiritually and have formed part of the Vekllei identity. Vekllei has the most flowers per capita in the world. The final, larger 10,000VK coin represents the previous seven together, as a total sum of Vekllei landscape and identity.\n To answer Tzipora‚Äôs question ‚Äî a bottle of fizzy drink cost about 2VK in the waning days of coinage in the early 2020s.\n A Map of Vekllei: 100 Boroughs; 100 Hearts üìñ Published 14th June 2020 | Read here.\nMap Key\nRed: Magjet trains, 750km/h Yellow: Bullet trains, 300-400km/h Orange: Regional trains, \u0026lt;150km/h Brown: Local trains, including limited express, \u0026lt;100km/h Blue: National highway Dashed: Ferry line Green: tarmacadamed airport  The largest division of any portion of Vekllei land is the borough; a region of varying size and population with common culture, food dependency and economic interest. Anything larger than that is simply Vekllei ‚Äî they are ‚Äúone city‚Äù, after all, and consider themselves a city-state.\nThere have been exactly 100 boroughs since 2015. Each is named after the largest city in its region.\n The smallest borough is Bakur, in Afouismeh, with a population of 7,500 people. The largest is Vekllei proper, in the Capital Region, of 2.4 millions.  This transit map illustrates all 100 boroughs, Vekllei‚Äôs five tallest mountains, its permafrost glaciers and Tzipora‚Äôs home in Montre-Lola. Her five largest boroughs ‚Äî namely Vekllei, Lonne, Adouisneh, Montre and Copette, are highlighted.\nEven in this simple transit map we can see several truths about the country, like its population bias on the West Coast and the emptiness of the Lava volcanic region. You might recognise a few names there, like Lola in the West (Tzipora‚Äôs home with Baron) and Yana in Vekllei‚Äôs Ro Highlands (Ayn‚Äôs birthplace).\nTrains are clean, reliable, fast, efficient and safe. They are incorporated under Vekllei Rail, owned by the Transport Group Bureau. Using this map, designed for domestic tourists and foreigners, the adequacy of Vekllei‚Äôs rail transport is easy to plan around ‚Äî you can eat breakfast in a cafe in the seaside town of Mumen, and hike before midday on the glacial slopes of Askayoisn. Since there are no tickets or costs, there are no excuses for not visiting relatives in the country, now that transport is now a trivial inconvenience.\nEach borough is represented in Vekllei‚Äôs parliament by an elected representative. These representatives wield extraordinarily disproportionate power ‚Äî the representative for Callaisn, for example, represents hundreds of times more people than the representative for Tanger, but both have the same vote. This is because boroughs are not just representative of their populations, but also their environments, industry and other social organs otherwise unable to vote. It is important to keep in mind that Upen (and consequently, policy) recognises the landscape itself as the sovereign organ of the country, and so in this sense it has its own interests and projections.\nIn practice, representatives act in an advisory, nonpartisan role in government, voting rarely in an auxiliary role to the professionalised, elected legislature. Vekllei has a strictly constitutional parliament, and the economy largely prohibits interference. In this sense, the parliament is both partially undemocratic in its inefficiency and apolitical in its orientation as a sort of civil service bureau, managing state affairs and reacting to pressures and the long-term aims outlined in the 2015 constitution. In the Vekllei mindset, the ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù is more or less another bureau, no different or particularly more interesting than the Transport Group Bureau. The trains, at least, have a tangible impact on their daily lives.\nHow appropriate, then, that this transit map produced in the summer months of 2076 combines both monuments of society. It also offers a glimpse of a larger, documented country not necessarily revealed in piecemeal story posts.\n A Most Beautiful Woman üìñ Published 12th June 2020 | Read here.\nWhen Tzipora first laid eyes on Ayn, hours after her arrival in the country, she thought, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the most beautiful woman I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äù\nIt wasn‚Äôt just her features or figure that captured Tzipora‚Äôs attention ‚Äî it was also her confident, inconspicuous movements and a quiet self-assuredness that seemed obvious in her gentle expression and posture. Tzipora was not quite sure how to describe it. Her beauty was very alive in the way she inhabited a space, as she walked into the hotel lounge to meet them. Maybe it was grace ‚Äî maybe it was a little girl-crush ‚Äî she didn‚Äôt know.\nAs Baron greeted her and they exchanged cheek kisses, it appeared to Tzipora that Ayn and Baron were old friends, and she was further assured in her respect for him ‚Äî that Baron could know such beautiful women seemed natural! Baron was capable of anything in Tzipora‚Äôs eyes, a figure of ultimate power ‚Äî it only made sense that he knew this woman!\nOf course, both Ayn and Baron were mortal, and Tzipora got to know them well during the helter-skelter weeks following her arrival in Vekllei. Baron might have rescued her, but it was Ayn who introduced her to Vekllei, as AB/NI called Baron into office for the first time in a decade. It was Ayn who took her clothes shopping and wrestled with Zelda‚Äôs obsessive-compulsive fabric requirements. It was Ayn who taught Tzipora her first Vekllei sentence. And in the end, it was Ayn who convinced Baron that he had to take responsibility for Tzipora.\nIt was only years later that Tzipora began to realise that Ayn and Baron were, in a sense, married to each other through their work. They worked closely (he as recent head of operations at AB/NI, she as a research analyst in American economics) and their friendship went back decades. She was his ‚Äúwork wife,‚Äù which was the closest Baron could ever get to that particular institution, and so her proximity and love towards Tzipora made her a mother.\nShe was a vision of everything Tzipora wanted for herself ‚Äî to be capable and respected; beautiful and unassuming; intelligent and productive. And once more, it was Ayn, in the end, who convinced Tzipora that she could these things for herself, regardless of her genetic disability. ‚ÄúGo out there,‚Äù is what she said, ‚Äúand trust in yourself.‚Äù\n The Oa-Class Battlecruiser üìñ Published 6th June 2020 | Read here.\nVekllei‚Äôs defensive military posture has, in doctrine and arms development, limited its ability to meaningfully project power outside of the Atlantic. As an island nation with a large and multifaceted naval armada, the Oa-Class Battlecruiser is the heart of her armed forces, as the flagship of her fleets.\nWhere U.S. doctrine places carriers offensively in the structure of its ship-groups, the Vekllei Navy is considerably more Soviet in its employ of carriers as primarily defensive air-bases to exercise sovereignty over her far-flung territories and island possessions. Oa-class Battlecruisers are notable as hybrid carrier-battleships, and feature a diagonal jetway with capacity for carrier-type naval jets (almost indistinguishable in the illustration above) and a variety of VTOL aircraft, which are common by the 2050s.\nFirst built in the 2050s by the sprawling National Naval Arsenal (located on Vekllei‚Äôs Far East coast, close to the foundries that pour her iron), 12 Oa-Class Battlecruisers are in service in the 2070s. They carry heavy fission reactors built by bureau monopoly General Reactor, supplemented by a gas-turbine generator, as is standard on all Vekllei-built nuclear vessels. Her unusual serpentine funnel is characteristic of Vekllei‚Äôs navy, and is a distinguishing feature of their naval design language.\nHer hulking superstructure and massive 15-inch fore guns recall the capital battleships of yesteryear, but she is a thoroughly modern battlecruiser with contemporary armament and electrics for combat and fleet administration. Named after Vekllei‚Äôs National flower, these Battlecruisers are the third-largest vessels in the navy and are multifunctional by design, often operated as strategic and operational platforms to support Vekllei‚Äôs large defensive armadas that patrol the North Atlantic.\n She is armed with two triple-barrelled 15-inch shore guns that can be loaded with a variety of shells including nuclear payloads, silos for guided missiles, and specialised guns and missile platforms for anti-ship, submarine and satellite warfare. Her powerful communications array and sensors are positioned 80 meters above the surface for the benefit of radar and subsurface monitoring. She can also support up to 12 standard carrier jets at one time, or 16 individual helijets/VTOL craft.\n Vekllei has larger battlecruisers (the so-called super-battlecruisers match her height and are nearly twice her length) and much larger carriers, but the displacement of the vessel was never a priority. Vekllei‚Äôs naval architecture prioritises mobility and capability in their capital ships, and so the Oa-class vessels represent many intersecting vertices of Vekllei‚Äôs naval doctrine.\n Canal Living üìñ Published 3rd June 2020 | Read here.\nAtlantic Salmon was the best in the world, and Vekllei had a lot of it. Ocean-going fishing boats brought their haul to Ro, where they cruised wide postwar canals and unloaded tonnes of shiny, bright salmon into processing plants. If a new factory was built, so too was a canal or a railroad. Nothing was trucked. Fish was traded fresh in markets or turned into emulsifiers and fertiliser.\nThe canals were worked heavily, and few fishing vessels were incorporated. The vast majority of Vekllei‚Äôs fishing fleet was owned by the people that worked them, trading with the Sea Office. From a quaisiosn or ‚Äúcanal park‚Äù you might see a dozen vessels in an hour. Some were run-down prewar things limping out to the shallow coasts, while others were nuclear-powered salmon trawlers designed for the storms of the Atlantic. On the northern coast, the bigger boats were reinforced as ice-breakers. Fish was one of the few meats in the Vekllei diet that wasn‚Äôt grown in an industrial laboratory, a fact reflected in the scale of its infrastructure.\nCanals are good for a city, and are good for the heart. Tzipora would take long walks in the morning along the Wellington Canal to where it met Touismah, then follow it to where it circled back into Lola. She would figure out what she was doing with her life as the boats departed for the day‚Äôs catch. She never much liked salmon, but she liked the boats. They were an island country, and their futures and pasts met in the sea ‚Äî where it churned and swelled in their dreams.\n VI. The Post Office Aussie Thoughts on Police Violence [NEW] BY HANGDOG#4510\nIf you lived under a rock, you might be excused for missing the brutal murder of George Floyd. Unfortunately for you, America is the centre of all Earthly affairs, so the odds of the social media wildfire missing you are slim to none. But that‚Äôs okay, really, because at least it gives you something interesting to watch on the news, as a police station is torched or a wheelchair-bound hobo has his face blown open with a rubber bullet.\nCan we Australians say we are better than Americans? Absolutely. You‚Äôre 27 times more likely to be executed by a police officer in the States than you are here. Roughly 25% of the world‚Äôs prison population can be found in the ‚Äòland of the free‚Äô, and it seems every single protest has resulted in someone losing an eye or being knocked into tomorrow. But are we perfect? Fuck to the no. Earlier this month, videos surfaced of a police officer sweeping the legs of an Indigenous youth in retaliation for a few measly swears. Almost a third of our prison population are Aboriginal Australian, despite accounting for just over 3% of our general population. That sucks.\nWhat are our possible solutions? Currently the popular rhetoric is radical and reactionary, with #ACAB and #AbolishThePolice signaturing every ‚Äòwoke‚Äô Twitter or Instagram post. These reductionist slogans do hold merit; it‚Äôs not the individual that is evil, it‚Äôs the policing institution as a whole. Money that is spent inflating the budgets of corrupt police departments and outfitting riot squads with military-grade hardware could be better spent on community solutions. We need to elevate communities from the material poverty which leads to crime.\nThe question, then, is culture. Do we in the West have a social consciousness ready for community policing? Can we be sure that a decreased police presence will stop scenes like the Murray Hill Riots in Canada, where a police strike led to 16 hours of widespread looting? Can the West, and especially the Americans, really be trusted to govern themselves? This author thinks no. Excluding utopian socialist ideas that the root of all human evils is capitalism, tangible solutions are necessary.\nIt seems to be that the pragmatic approach is the strongest. Reforming police unions, holding officers accountable for crimes they commit on duty, and increase the standards necessary to wear the uniform and possess the badge. These sensible, attainable solutions would not only have immediate effects, but could have long term effects on American culture at large.\nReform however cannot perfectly address the root of the issue with the police. The police do and always will be the only entity to possess a ‚Äòlegitimate‚Äô monopoly on violence. There is no use boring you in an anarchist breakdown of the monopoly on violence and the danger of hierarchies, because some dead revolutionary from the last century has put it better in some dusty tome. Simply put, any hierarchical enforcement of law will always justify the use of violence. The key is examining culture and society, and deciding on meaningful compromise between an ideological ideal and a pragmatic policy. We can negotiate between what is and what ought, but no solution will be perfect. Laws are by their very nature imperfect and malleable, bound not to a higher authority but to a cultural identity. The aim is not utopia, but to possess something that is better than what we have today.\n Live to Ride: Harley-Davidson and the Commodification of Identity [NEW] BY CHEVALIERMALFET#1904\n‚ÄúThe proof,‚Äù they say, ‚Äúis in the pudding.‚Äù\nIf you ask a motorcyclist about Harley Davidson, you‚Äôll get one of two answers. The people who don‚Äôt ride them scoff at them - heavy, dirty, clunky, and slow, Nixon-era dinosaurs inferior to both the Japanese standards and their own clones. If you ask a dedicated Harley rider, though, you get a different picture - they love their machines and their experiences riding them, and would never consider abandoning the company for a rival‚Äôs product. How has this company inspired such loyalty in spite of its terrible product?\nBefore I reach the point of this essay, fair is fair: Harley Davidson has an excellent customer service program and a wide network of dealers and mechanics. While this has nothing to do with the bikes themselves, it‚Äôs still a point in their favor.\nBut the main point is simple. A man who buys a Harley isn‚Äôt simply getting a new vehicle - he (and it is almost always he) is buying a new identity. Because of Harley‚Äôs tireless marketing, he has a very clear image of the sort of person who owns one. Every bike sold comes with a ticket to a new sense of self, and a new life as a ‚ÄúHarley Guy.‚Äù\nWho is the ‚ÄúHarley Guy?‚Äù Who does this new rider imagine he‚Äôll become? 60 years ago, the Harley image was bound up with real antisocial behavior. The first wave of bikers were WW2 veterans, shell-shock cases unable to return to civilian life, and their bikes were military surplus. Hunter S. Thomson‚Äôs Hell‚Äôs Angels describes the titular gang shooting heroin and smashing up gas stations.\nBut as the sixties wore on and the original bikers aged out or died off, Harley shifted its marketing. When its last domestic competitor went out of business, Harley wrapped itself in the flag and called itself the only choice for ‚ÄúReal Americans.‚Äù When Japan started selling small-displacement moped scooters, Harley touted its big bikes as the only choice for ‚ÄúReal Men.‚Äù When the automobile industry faced tighter safety regulations, Harley lobbied against helmet laws and called their buyers ‚ÄúReal Rebels.‚Äù\nCombine it together and a picture emerges: the ‚ÄúHarley Guy‚Äù may be out of step with square society, but he‚Äôs still a member of it - and its enemies are still his enemies. He might rebel against the rat race and the nanny state - especially when they want him to wear a helmet - but that‚Äôs because he‚Äôs channeling the purest essence of America, the cowboy spirit of an imaginary past. He salutes the troops and supports the police, and he always stands up for the national anthem. Most of all, he is a member of a group - the Harley brotherhood, a community of like-minded individuals.\nFor most of the 80s, the American government protected Harley-Davidson with crushing tariffs. But those tariffs expired in 1988, and Harley was forced to fight the Japanese on even terms. Fighting bike-to-bike was impossible; the four Japanese OEMs were lean, mean, and honed to razors after 40 years of competition. Instead, Harley tripled-down on the marketing. The dealerships are apparel-shops, where customers can buy logo-branded shirts, bags, shot-glasses, and travel checkers sets. It has never been easier to show your identity - and your membership in the corporate family.\nMost advertisers sell their product by selling the image of the person who owns it, but Harley-Davidson must be the most infamous, and obvious, example.\n VII.

Overview The language of Vekllei is an important part of the project. Utopianism cascades through every part of society, and rethinking communication is a foundational part of that instinct. In this article, we look at what makes Vekllei as a language special, and give insight into how these Atlantic people communicate with each other.   What is the worth of the worthless? I think it is the existence of a marvellous intuitive physicality. That is, if we use words to carve out things as having certain functions and certain uses to human beings, we overlook something very important.\n ‚Äî Yoshio Nakamura\nV ekllei language, abbreviated to just Vekllei, has six core sublanguages that are used commonly today. Although they often intersect, these different systems of communication are distinct languages in their own right, used for different purposes in different arenas of communication.\nSystems of Language  Spoken Vekllei, which is everyday spoken language. It draws from two glossaries with different meanings and feelings, called Oa and Loh. Topet, which are logographic characters (occasionally characterised as hieroglyphs). Like other pictographic languages, Topet characters can be broken down into repeating components, called Topotte. Rapotenne, is the traditional logographic language of names. It is much older than Topet, and has more in common with spiritual runes than modern logography. Potenne, lit. ‚ÄúHand-Talk‚Äù, is a sign language that incorporates gestures and signing to add meaning to emotion to spoken language, and occasionally in place of it. Upotenne, lit. ‚ÄúSpirit-Hand-Talk‚Äù, as the recreation of runes in human form, used limitedly in spiritual ritual. Vekllei Semaphore is the codification of colour and shape. Traditionally limited to colour, shape and pattern are now also included in Vekllei Semaphore, in which full sentences can be formed.    Introduction An infographic showcasing the Vekllei language, including Potenne use. | How to Speak Vekllei  ‚ùñ Read more: How to Speak Vekllei  Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look in more detail about how each aspect of the Vekllei language operates in daily life. With six recognised language, Vekllei is unique in its complexity and multidimensionality, appropriating a variety of scripts, glossaries, alphabets and physical components. Literacy in the country is very high, and Spoken Vekllei and Topet are understood universally. Other languages, often called sub-languages, are informed regionally and have varying literacy across the Home Island. For example, Upotenne is employed frequently in rural and agrarian communities, where religious ritual requires its frequent practice. This passage introduces the broad characteristics of each sub-language, which together form contemporary Vekllei, one of the world\u0026rsquo;s most complex and hermetic language systems.\nHistory Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s language genealogy can be traced back thousands of years, and is approximated in this timeline for reference throughout this article.\n  6000 BC - 3500 BC, Kalaallisut / Kala, Proto-Quutetast extinct Algic language. 3500 BC - 800 AD, Quutetast, Algic-Aleutian extinct language. 1200 BC - 900 AD, Islandi, Indo-European Scandinavian language. 900 AD - 1600 AD, Topyas (Old Vekllei), fusion dialect of Islandi and Quutetast. 1600 AD - present, Modern Vekllei, evolution of Topyas. Spoken today.   2. Spoken Vekllei Spoken Vekllei, simply referred to as Vekllei domestically, is the common spoken language of Vekllei and official language of the country, spoken by some 25 million people worldwide, with 98% of speakers living natively in the Vekllei Home Islands. It is the first spoken language of the vast majority of the population, and has minor variance across the disparate Vekllei Home Islands and other Vekllei possessions. It is rarely spoken outside of Vekllei territories, extant abroad only through emigrant populations and small diasporic communities dispersed after the Atomic War.  Contemporary spoken Vekllei is largely descended from Proto-Islandi speech that arrived with the first Danish settlers in the country, but includes Kalaallisut and Proto-Algic reconstructions of an early extinct language called Kala. Modern spoken Vekllei has heritage in the combined, largely extinct language hybrid of Algic-Aleutian Quutetast and the Indo-European Islandi, which by the 9th century had fused into common speech usually called Topyas, or \u0026lsquo;Old Speech\u0026rsquo;/\u0026lsquo;Old Vekllei\u0026rsquo;. Modern Vekllei has evolved distinctively since the Atomic War as part of broader sociological trends towards informalised speech and cultivated Loh vocabularies.\nTwin Glossaries Spoken Vekllei draws from two glossaries, called Oa and Loh. These glossaries date back to twin reconstructed Algic-Aleutian languages called Quutetast and Islandi that had been present in earlier forms since at least 1200BC. The glossaries were formalised in pagan ritual that would become present-day Upen, and later recognised as the official language of the country in the reformation initiated by Queen Souisviasn in the 3rd century.\n  Oa (lit. Sun) Oa is considered to have \u0026lsquo;permanent\u0026rsquo; traits. It is often characterised abroad as a positive glossary, though this is not true \u0026ndash; it is in fact dedicated to inanimate and unliving organs. Although Vekllei does not gender nouns, this glossary is often gendered conceptually as masculine, and is most commonly associated with Summer and Spring. Despite its long history, Vekllei as an island is itself understood to be female \u0026ndash; mostly because its volcanic landscape, which straddles two drifting continental plates, is constantly changing.  Loh (lit. Moon) Loh is considered to have \u0026lsquo;cyclical\u0026rsquo; traits. Loh words are largely derived from Old Vekllei (including Icelandic/Islandi), and so its glossary is considerably less defined and dependent on older linguistic artefacts. Loh words incorporate sounds and grammatical artefacts from extinct languages within Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s ancient history, and so it is often associated with traditional or formal speech. It is commonly gendered as feminine, and is associated with winter and autumn.  In modernity, this binary produces bizarre psycholinguistic quirks. For example, a sailing vessel (Siv) is derived from the Oa, historically because the Oa glossary was favoured for machines between the 10th and 16th Centuries. This genders all modern oceangoing vessels as male figures to this day, and due to Siv\u0026rsquo;s linguistic derivatives, ties ships permanently to the lumber and woodlands critical to wooden shipbuilding. From the 20th century onwards, however, most vehicles are regarded impermanent through Loh, and so all cars in Vekllei are conceptually female.\nPhonology Spoken Vekllei is phonologically homogenous, and has little variation in accent or pronunciation across the Home Island or its various possessions, although there is some evidence for differences in dialect between cultivated speech on the coast and rural phonology in the interior of the Home Islands.\nMonophthongs Pure vowels in Vekllei are characterised by their lax, non-rhotic sound, and their uses vary across cultivated and common Vekllei dialects.\nPure Vowels     Front   Central  Back       Short Long Long (round) Short Long Short Long   Close …™ iÀê y   âÀê  ä    Close-Mid   √∏       Mid e eÀê  …ô …úÀê …î oÀê   Open-Mid   ≈ì       Open √¶ (√¶Àê)  …ê …êÀê        Diphthongs From foundational monophthongs, gliding or diphthong vowels are often determined by glossary. Oa typically favours modernised post-Quutetast glides for its so-called Ocean Vowels, which are generally long and unrounded. Loh words are typically older and depicted pictographically, and are pronounced as Floral Vowels. The tables below list their pronunciation.\nDiphthongs Ocean Vowels     Vowel     Closing √¶…™, …ë…™, o…™, √¶…î, …ô â   Centering …™…ô    Floral Vowels    Vowel Onset glide Onset glide Onset glide     Vowel /j/ /…•/ /w/   /a/ /ja/ /…•a/ /wa/   /…ë/ /j…ë/ /…•…ë/ /w…ë/   /…ëÃÉ/ /j…ëÃÉ/ /…•…ëÃÉ/ /w…ëÃÉ/   /e/ /je/ /…•e/ /we/   /…õ/ /j…õ/ /…•…õ/ /w…õ/   /…õÃÉ/ /j…õÃÉ/ /…•…õÃÉ/ /w…õÃÉ/   /i/ /ji/ /…•i/ /wi/   /o/ /jo/ /…•o/ /wo/   /…î/ /j…î/ /…•…î/ /w…î/   /…îÃÉ/ /j…îÃÉ/ /…•…îÃÉ/ /w…îÃÉ/   /√∏/ /j√∏/ /…•√∏/ /w√∏/   /≈ì/ /j≈ì/ /…•≈ì/ /w≈ì/   /u/ /ju/     /y/ /jy/         Consonants In Vekllei, consonants are arranged in five places of primary articulation.\nConsonants     Labial Alveolar Palatal Velar Uvular     Voiceless stop p /p/ t /t/  k /k/ q /q/   Voiceless fricative  s /s/≈Ç /…¨/(h /h/)      Voiced v /v/ l /l/ j /j/(j, rÃÇ /…ü/) g /…°/ r / Å/   Nasal m /m/ n /n/  ng /≈ã/       3. Topet Topet, sometimes called Vekllei Script or Vekllei hieroglyphs is the formal writing system in Vekllei. Topet incorporates logographic and neosyllabic/abugida-type components, and has some 3,450 unique characters in modern usage. Although proto-glyphs and a primitive runic system had been used in Islandi-era Vekllei since at least the 8th Century BC, by the time Quutetast influences had arrived with Inuit settlement in the 4th Century AD the parent scripts had at least partially fused into proto-Topet, called Hieyeric. In Vekllei, Topet is the national language alongside its sister-form, Rapotenne and Spoken Vekllei. Topet has no clear lineage from Scandinavian or Inuit languages, and so is rarely understood outside of the territories where it is an official or significant minority language, which represents some 25 million people.  Individual Topet characters are both phonograms and semagrams, and so they support multiple readings. Many are basically figurative, and represent conceptually what they depict. Each character conforms to an abugida-type system, in which consonant-vowel pairings are written in joined notation. In Topet, the consonant anchors the pairing, which is called Lohtopet, and vowel notation is usually raised in superscript, called Oatopet. These names are not related to the binary glossary, but do represent the upper/lower system those glossaries imply. \u0026ldquo;Oa\u0026rdquo; means affirmative in Vekllei, and Loh is a negating form, so their use is widespread beyond the binary glossary system.\nPhonetic Reading Anchoring consonant-vowel characters (demioette, as opposed to double-vowels or vowel-consonants, called hieyerette 1) written in Topet may feature redundant adjacent characters called phonetic complements, which, in a non-determinative reading, are pronounced the same way to guide the reader. This lends to a system that encourages adjacent duplicate consonant-vowel pairings in some aspects, since Vekllei words are already formed out of neosyllabic pairings and it is immediately obvious which characters are to be read. The word for friend, comoyia, can thus sometimes be transliterated into c-c-com-moyia, which can affect the conceptual meanings of a word through the figurative placement of its characters as well as help guide the reader through the use of multiple phonetically identical, though visually distinct, characters.\nIn the above case, comoyia can be affected by the composition of its phonetic complements, if any are used at all. There is a default reading, which combines both semantic and phonetic readings for meaning and is generally recognised as the dictionary \u0026lsquo;spelling\u0026rsquo; of the word, but this can be manipulated through the addition of semantically different, but identically phonetic characters to shade and change meaning. The word for an untrustworthy friend is also comoyia, but combines the characters for snake with the dictionary spelling, which produces a transliteration similar to c-comoyia. In spoken Vekllei, this distinction is only communicable through the aid of Potenne, and represents one of its primary uses.\nSemantic Reading Many Topet characters are figurative; they represent their meanings pictographically, like Egyptian Hieroglyphs or Chinese Hanzi. In Vekllei, this is considered an evolved rune-form, and ties into a broader conceptualisation of language as a transcendental, rather than literal system. Although Topet\u0026rsquo;s early form, Hieyeric, was explicitly pictographic, modern Topet is often abstracted and decoupled from its figurative meaning via the phonetic system.\nDespite common use of the phonetic system in modernity, the semantic readings of characters are taught and essential for literacy beyond literal imitation of speech. For the vast majority of Topet characters, their logographic meaning determines their pronunciation, and consonant characters especially depend on this meaning to form words. The word for breakfast is petimourgeneur, but it cannot be written with random literal phonetic characters; parts of the word depend on the figurative meaning of certain components, and so without its semantic traits the word would be illegible to most people. This represents a wider co-dependency on simultaneous phonetic and semantic readings of words, with the importance of each fluctuating depending on the word in question. Older words tend to be heavily figurative, whereas modern and loan words are often more phonetic. This inconsistency is part of the difficulty in learning Topet, and leaves many immigrants fluent in speech but inadequately literate in reading and writing.\nStructure An infographic summarising the appearance of Vekllei scripts, including Topet. | How to Read Vekllei  ‚ùñ Read more: How to Read Vekllei  Individual Topet characters are both semantic and phonetic, and can be written in a phonetic abugida (with semantic weight carried by the initial character-group) or as a single character group. The abugida-form is phonetic and aids vocalisation through its hieyerette characters. The single character group-form is pictographic, and generally replaces the abugida in contexts where the pronunciation is commonly known or obvious. In these character groups, only one demioette character is vocalised, called the principle, and the hieyerette characters are simply not written.\nThese character groups are called Minor Demons, or pettidemion, and change appearance depending on the number of characters in its group. One character occupies a quarter-height space in the centre of a line. Two characters are written in an adjacent quarter-height space, with the principle arranged to the left. Three characters are arranged in a triangle, with the principle arranged at the top. Four characters, the maximum in modern Topet, are arranged in a quadrant with the principle arranged in the top left.\nMinor Demons are the foundations of Topet script, since they can be written phonetically or as pictographs. This also contributes to Topet\u0026rsquo;s unusual linguistic structure, in which single words are modified heavily and often come to resemble sentences with self-contained adjectives.\n4. Rapotenne Rapotenne (lit. \u0026ldquo;Name-Talk\u0026rdquo;) is the Vekllei system of names, often considered in modernity to function as a distinct, though limited, language. Today, it is most often employed as an extant language of magical staves, but is closely aligned phonologically and ethnographically with Upotenne, the physical language of rune-forms and sigils.  Contemporary Rapotenne is informed by pictographic proto-Topet runes as well as elements of the extinct Kala language, and subsequently Quutetast Algic artefacts. Because Kala is extinct and Quutetast is a dead language, largely displaced by modern spoken Vekllei, Rapotenne is unique among Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s sublanguages for its direct lineage from proto-linguistic forms of early Vekllei history, some nearly 4,000 years old. Today it is used largely ceremonially, through ritual related to birth and Blood Names 2.\nRapotenne has its origins in superstitious Islandi magical staves, sigils which evolved into battle names and honourifics, called Blood Names. The use of Blood Names varies across Vekllei history, but is still common across ancestral families today. In modern immigration, especially after the Atomic War and British occupation, Blood Names have been commonly adopted by new families as symbolic displacement of older bloodlines, largely for their fashionable association with royalty and heritage. Rapotenne today mostly employs older Floral Vowels, which themselves are likely evolutions of proto-Quutetast pronunciation associated with Kala. Rapotenne characters, also called Rapotenne, are closely associated with old runic Islandi sigils, and are purely figurative. Their use in modernity is largely instructional, and is used to determine and act out Upotenne signs, which is functionally adjacent to Rapotenne.\nPractice Rapotenne consists of 452 characters in common practice, although priests and regional dialects may employ upwards of 1,000. Despite integration with the formal Vekllei language constellation, minor differences in pronunciation survive. For example, the Alveolar /sÕá/ is dropped before consonants in ordinary spoken Vekllei, making it rare in modern usage, but is voiced in Rapotenne. The shape and stroke order of characters determines the physicality of Upotenne, as their function within ritual is more or less the same. Although simplistic and literally figurative, Rapotenne is used extensively in religious script and poetry, and remains an important cultural force within Vekllei.\n5. Potenne ‚ùñ Try Potenne yourself! Hold out your thumb and forefinger on one hand, and tuck the other fingers against your palm. You\u0026rsquo;ve just said \u0026ldquo;good to see you again.\u0026rdquo;  Potenne (lit. \u0026ldquo;Hand-Talk\u0026rdquo;) is an indigenous auxiliary sign language in Vekllei used commonly today as an aid or substitute for vocalised speech. It was originally a form of avoidance speech that arose in response to social taboos in Upen, but acquired broader use by the 16th century and is employed commonly today part of many conventions and customs within the Home Islands. Potenne is also used by hearing-disabled persons in Vekllei to communicate.  Historic social taboos in Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s dominant religion, Upen, prevented speech between people for a variety of reasons, including for marital, interfamilial, penal and ascetic considerations. Potenne first arose to avoid these taboos. During the first substantial immigration of Inuit-Kalaallisut peoples in the 4th century BC, proto-Potenne avoidance languages developed pragmatic pidgin forms to allow for trade and communication between settlers and the original Islandi population. This rapid expansion in use saw Potenne develop solidified cultural tenants, including phonologically distinct suprasegmental components like biouspotenne (lit. \u0026ldquo;Face-Talk\u0026rdquo;), which distinguishes facial expression from gestures in poetic, transcendental forms, and kiouyapotenne (lit. \u0026ldquo;Child-Talk\u0026rdquo;), which uses facial expressions to teach children individual signs.\nBy the 11th Century, Potenne was documented alongside other critical languages like Topet, and had demonstrated its saturation of Vekllei society in several sociological and cultural forms, including Upotenne, today considered an independent language system within Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s varied linguistic cultures.\nPotenne is used today as a casual substitute for simple speech and to communicate figurative meanings of words in Topet otherwise uncommunicable in conventional speech.\nPhonology It is important to remember that Potenne is not simply a reproduction of ordinary speech in physical form; it is a language that assists the spoken word. Many Vekllei words can be simplified by incorporating Potenne, which better mimics nonverbal components of Topet and helps provide emotion and context to otherwise ambiguous phrases. In other cases, it replaces speech entirely, often in quiet areas or out of respect in public transit. In this sense, Potenne retains a handful of the characteristics inherited from its origins as an avoidance language, but remains distinct from both spoken Vekllei and Topet in its capacity to link and colour both.\nLocation Most Potenne is acted out just below the chest, in a casual resting position. Positional and place-based signs are performed at the right shoulder, and emotion is often acted out at or just below the chin. Regional traits and dialects are common, and Potenne is perhaps Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s most provincial and least documented language.\nMovement Upen signs are generally simple, and practiced quickly and casually. The direction of the fore and ring fingers generally indicate subject, and the position of the thumb indicates tone ‚Äî an outstretched thumb is casual whereas a thumb tucked inwards appears formal. Common words use simple, single-handed signs, but complete sentences and more complex words almost always require the use of both hands.\nOrientation Communication in the your own voice is performed with the hand held horizontally with few exceptions. Quoting speech and reading is most often spoken with the hand held vertically, although this varies between dialects. Various orientations incorporate meaning, including casual affirmation and some emotions.\nHandshape Most signs are communicated with an open palm, although fists, hooked fingers, clenched fingers and relaxation of fingers are also used in various ways. Most common Potenne words are characterised by their informal, almost lazy composition, and so handshape is particularly gestural, often dependent on vocalised context to be legible. It can be difficult to determine within Potenne a clear distinction between non-linguistic gestural communication and its formalised language system, and so the emotiveness and context of its signs are critical to literacy in Vekllei.\n6. Upotenne Upotenne (lit. \u0026ldquo;Spirit-Hand-Talk\u0026rdquo;) is the nonverbal sign language of religious ritual in Vekllei. Although adjacent to Potenne, Upotenne is more closely historically aligned with Rapotenne than modern Vekllei.  Much as Potenne combines semantic and verbal forms to enhance communication, Upen appropriates the older pictographic Rapotenne script to aid spiritual ritual and demiosnjarnkah (lit. \u0026ldquo;Old Arts\u0026rdquo; 3). Although few Vekllei people are completely literate in it, Upotenne remains a cultural force throughout society and is used commonly in ritual around the Home Islands.\nUpotenne is characterised as a sign language in keeping with the traditions in Potenne, but also incorporates complex cultural artefacts unique to Upen within its symbolism as a language. It codifies the human form and reproduces it in a spiritual manner, assigning importance and symbolism to parts of the human body ignored by the secular Potenne. Where much of the communication in Potenne is dependent on hand-based signs and gestures, Upotenne is mostly positional, using joints and angles to imitate rune-forms. These type and imitation of rune-forms vary greatly between different parts of Vekllei society, since literacy is dependent on landscape; rural persons will most likely recognise and communicate runes that benefit harvest and weather, where urban persons are more likely to participate in ceremonies to benefit employment or love.\nThis multidimensionality means that Upotenne is uniquely dependent on place and circumstance, as Vekllei people learn and dispense with signs that benefit their circumstance. Despite Upotenne\u0026rsquo;s capacity as a language, it is largely displaced by its use as a spiritual adjacent to Potenne in modern society, leaving only Upen priests and disciples fluent in one of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s oldest cultural traditions.\n7. Vekllei Semaphore Vekllei lo da Myaiouisvah (lit. \u0026ldquo;Vekllei-Flag-System\u0026rdquo;) is the sixth and most unusual of the Vekllei sublanguages. It relies heavily on colour and form, and is largely abstracted from its subject matter. In this sense, Vekllei Semaphore can be considered to be asemic, since it has no material semantic meaning and is entirely illegible without instruction.  It is most commonly used to enhance Topet and communicate in public spaces, through stationary, flags, banners, painted lines, stylised infrastructure and clothing as shorthand for established Topet phrases. Its association with media like television and illustration has caused some ethnographers to suggest Vekllei Semaphore as sign of evolving postliteracy4 in Vekllei, as modern systems of media and communication make it easier for people to go without reading or writing day-to-day.\nVekllei lo da Myaiouisvah originated in the early 17th century in the navy, where it was largely informed by Upotenne. It had an obvious practical purpose in communication between oceangoing vessels, but later saw general use among ordinary people as Vekllei developed, evolving into a sort of natural industrial sister language of Rapotenne.\nBy the 19th Century, Vekllei Semaphore had lost a lot of its original connotations with military pragmatism and had started to evolve and establish itself in different roles in society, fuelled by an emerging aesthetic interest in bloodlines and colonial enterprise. Colour and formless symbolism quickly took on new meaning as a way of distinguishing class and education across the country in highly fashionable shifts in culture. As the colonial machine of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s late monarchy and early junta developed a sprawling bureaucracy and civil service, these meanings were codified and later formalised as the language of the empire. It was rapidly revitalised during Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s independence from British occupation after the First Atomic War, and is the youngest and fastest-developing of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s languages. It remains a unique cultural phenomenon among developed countries today.\nVekllei Semaphore is most useful in public, shared space as a form of mass-communication. Its relative universality within the country means that many public-facing organisations and concerns employ it as a sort of \u0026lsquo;shared symbolism;\u0026rsquo; an unspoken democratic language used in shared spaces and common forums.\nSymbolism There are several components within Vekllei Semaphore which employs types of symbolism depending on their purpose and context.\nColourcoda Colourcoda is the means by which Vekllei Semaphore reassembles colour values in social forms through patterns, colour placement and contrast. Visitors will likely have encountered Colourcoda without even realising it; the transliteration of green and gold on the uniforms of Puffin Scouts is \u0026ldquo;peacefulness besides the land;\u0026rdquo; the red and white of the Vekllei school uniform means \u0026ldquo;youth of Vekllei,\u0026rdquo; and the blue and white of a Venopor police car means \u0026ldquo;royal defence\u0026rdquo;. Patterns quickly complexify this meaning, allowing for more sophisticated sentence construction, though few Vekllei people are fluent.\nFormsigns Formsigns are the means by which Vekllei Semaphore encodes meaning in shape. Vekllei (as a landscape) is depicted by a circle within the Loh glossary, and an arched point in the Oa glossary. These forms are adjacent to pictographics, but formsigns can also be totally abstracted. The borders on stationary and envelopes, for example, contain specific meaning when joined with specific colours. This concept saturates Vekllei society \u0026ndash; title cards in television, armbands, pinstripes, aircraft livery and basic shapes can all produce phonetic recognition in Vekllei people depending on their context and use.\nSemaphore Flags are used heavily in Vekllei semaphore, but are distinct from traditional semaphore systems through their use and appearance. Semaphore within da Myaiouisvah share more in common with Upotenne than they do alphabetic semaphore, and are largely figurative of extant runes. Flags are also very common objects that incorporate formsigns and colourcoda, and used frequently within Vekllei as means of communication. Festivals, companies and bureaus all use their own flags as means of identifying and communicating in public space.\nNotes   Demioette and hieyerette meaning lit. \u0026ldquo;early lower\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;early higher\u0026rdquo; respectively.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Blood Names are traditional ancestral names carried along a mother\u0026rsquo;s genetic heritage.

For many foreigners, Royal Mail aircraft may be the closest they ever come to seeing for themselves the mysterious Atlantic country. For Vekllei residents, the ancient organisation is a living relic of the country\u0026rsquo;s ancient history, and an ongoing testament to the longevity of their people.  T he Royal Mail of Vekllei, referred to as the Mail or Mail A.r.1 within the country, is the national postal carrier of Vekllei. It is a military state requisite reponsible for all postage in the country, and delivers nearly 50 million mail pieces domestically and abroad each day. One of the oldest institutions of its kind in Vekllei, it was founded in 1422 as a courier system between the Vekllei Kingdom and its largely mercenary military force. In 1742, it was formalised as a modern postal system available to the civilian public, and today offers a variety of services available to all Vekllei residents, including external territories.\nVekllei is also home to the U.N. Universal Postal Union, the body responsible for coordinating international postage, of which Vekllei is a signatory.\nIntroduction An MS Model 54-2 \u0026ldquo;Fairie,\u0026rdquo; used to deliver mail to Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s islands and islets | The Fairie  ‚ùñ Read more: Post is for People  The Mail is old enough to have its own hieroglyph in Topet, which has resulted in the somewhat misleading transliteration of its name. In Vekllei, it is simply called the \u0026lsquo;Mail\u0026rsquo;, since its written name includes both its royal and national meanings intrinsically. Abroad, this is usually translated as the Royal Mail of Vekllei, but this is in fact more of a description of the organisation than its proper name.\nSince Vekllei refers to its territory as its sovereign (expressed commonly as the \u0026lsquo;Landscape Sovereign\u0026rsquo;), the Mail remains Royal even today, centuries after the collapse of the monarchy that founded it. Despite its regular function as a postal service, it is nonetheless considered a resource of landscape, not a government department, and so it remains \u0026ldquo;the Royal Mail of Vekllei\u0026rdquo; in the 21st Century.\nLike most Royal Bureaus, the Mail is headquartered in Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s capital across a dozen or so city blocks dedicated to administration, manufacturing, vehicle storage and maintenance, and Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s General Post Office. There are over 6,400 post offices in Vekllei today, connecting the dense Home Islands to its far-flung peripheral territories.\nHistory ‚ùñ Read more: The Men and Women of the Royal Mail in Vekllei  Although Vekllei has maintained courier systems for at least a thousand years, the Mail as a contiguous instituion was founded in 1422 by the Desimou VII, King of Vekllei, in the late Period of Rest. During this time, the lords of Vekllei had established significant mercantile holdings across the North Atlantic, and had developed reliable systems of trade throughout Ireland and Denmark. The Royal Mail of Vekllei was first established as a royal communications organ that sought to ensure stability of the Desimou rule across the incresingly autonomous Vekllei empire. In this period, the Mail consisted of a handful of messengers attached to the feudal military apparatus of the Vekllei monarchy, which transferred to the incoming Junta upon collapse of the monarchy.\nThe Mail would not come to resemble conventional civilian Mail until 1652, when the Junta expanded postal contracts to the privy councils of the Faroe and Greenland territories, and later broke apart the Mail monopoly to benefit then-Secretary of State Kism Sismiosnah, who established the New Parliament Postal Service. It was not until nearly a century later, in 1742, that company services were opened to all land-owning Vekllei people, and the Mail came to resemble its contemporary mandate.\nThe Mail was reestablished in 2015, during Vekllei independence. It was afforded a mandate protected by the postwar Petticoat Constitution, and all existing private mail services established in occupation were folded directly into the new state monopoly. In 2016, a year after reestablishment, Mi Miou was elected as the world\u0026rsquo;s first female Postmistress General. The Floral Period of the Royal Mail has been marked by a rapid expansion of both infrastructure and services in Vekllei and abroad. World Post, the international for-profit arm of the Mail, was established in 2034.\nStructure ‚ùñ Read more: The Postmistress of Vekllei  The Mail is organised horizontally as an independent branch of the Royal Vekllei Armed Forces, and so, unlike other State Requisites, reports directly to the Prime Ministers of the Vekllei Government, as representatives of the Landscape Sovereign. As is common with most large-scale industry in Vekllei, the Mail is vertically integrated, and the majority of its contract work is consolidated directly into the bureau structure.\nThe Mail has two offices of administration: the General Office and the Office of the Postmistress, which are responsible for daily operations and interdepartmental administration respectively. The following table outlines the Mail\u0026rsquo;s structure.\nThe Royal Mail of Vekllei  General Office  Postal Service Bureau  Royal Mail Press  Bulletin of the Mail Materials Manufacturie   Financial Services Bureau Special Services Office  Postal Inspection Offices Joint HO/NI Postal Commission     Overseas Service Bureau  World Post Company Universal Express Company   Office of Mail  VK Mail Chapel (VKC 1st Mail Workers Unite) Service Assurance Office   Office of Telecommunications  Cosma  Cosma Vekllei Cosma Overseas   Industrial Telecommunications Office   Office of Company Infrastructure  Department of Lines Department of Post Boxes Department of Vehicles     Office of the Postmistress  Postal Commission Mail Democracy Office      Services Tzipora arranges some of her favourite Vekllei stamps | Philately Foolery  ‚ùñ Read more: Philately Foolery  The Royal Mail maintains a constitutionally-bound monopoly on all postage in the country, leaving it the sole provider of universal postage service in Vekllei. Like most State Requisites (A.r.), however, it has substantial international trade and foreign dealings that provide for its common description as a state-owned for-profit enterprise, or public corporation.  Universal service is, by the glossary of the Mail, truly universal. As mandated by Vekllei law, the Mail provides delivery for all postage material anywhere in the world, or indeed, beyond it. It maintains 6,424 post offices across Vekllei, including its antarctic and peripheral possessions. The Mail\u0026rsquo;s first Lunar Post Office opened in 2059. In addition to its domestic monopoly, the Mail contributes nearly VK‚ù¶2.6 trillion each year towards the Vekllei Government Securities Bureau (the country\u0026rsquo;s sovereign wealth fund) through its international postage and courier services abroad, under the name World Post.\nSince the Mail\u0026rsquo;s Office of Telecommunications is also responsible for all telephones, telegrams and videophones in the country, the Mail\u0026rsquo;s status as a lynchpin of communication is absolute, and heavily protected by the postwar Vekllei constitution.\nDaily Service ‚ùñ Read more: Racing the Post Office to the Station  The Mail aims to provide next-day delivery during weekdays in zero-code (that is to say, Home Island) regions. Overnight delivery is also generally available between Home Islands, Aismious Islands, Kala and the Azores during weekdays. Most Lunar territories are available on Mondays and Fridays, and other territories are available according to the Mail\u0026rsquo;s region table.\nAlthough Vekllei people do not pay to post items, stamps are affixed with coloured squares called chromacodes which are used in the automatic sorting machines common in the country. International Mail uses traditional stamps with price listed, and the Vekllei Crown displayed. Franking is used for tracking and identification.\nSpecial Delivery Special, commercial and industrial postage is managed within the Postal Service Bureau through special sorting facilities and a dedicated postal network. Regular business postage is funnelled through regular daily service, but hazardous, oversized and dangerous goods are accepted by special Post Offices designed to accept them. The Mail does not provide special services for regular residential or courier delivery.\nInternational Service The Mail is best known overseas as the World Post, which offers services for foreign clients and has established itself as one of the Big Four international transnational courier services in the world today. Similar to domestic postal systems in other countries, the World Post offers flat rates for delivery anywhere in the world, priced according to size and weight. In addition, sister company Universal Express offers next-day weekday delivery in certain markets. Most employees of the World Post and Universal Express are foreign workers banking labour-hours for immigration to Vekllei. Unlike domestic service, the World Post and Universal Express use private courier contracts extensively to fulfil orders.\nFinance The Labour Bank of Vekllei2 is easily accessible via the Mail\u0026rsquo;s Financial Services Bureau. Although inaccessible within the country, savings can be withdrawn conditionally upon emigration, and the Mail offers easy access and financial counselling for Vekllei people. Through the Financial Services Bureau, the Mail also offers financial management to immigrant populations with wealth transfer (the phrase for banking of savings and prior income) and Overseas Accounting, commonly used to send money to family abroad.\nTelecommunications Cosma (a portmanteau of communicasia matismion) is Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s state communications company, responsible for all residential and public telephones in the country. This includes videophones, public phone booths, and residential networks. Cosma also maintains telecommunications infrastructure networks internationally through Cosma Overseas, primarily the Vekllei-Europe undersea cables and their sister sets between Vekllei and North America. Much of the network dates back over a hundred years, since a shortage of modern personal telephones in Vekllei requires Cosma to maintain a wide variety of voltage and cable standards. Commercial, industrial and government telecommunications is managed by a seperate internal department called the Industrial Telecommunications Office.\nOperations Outdoor view of the Royal Mail\u0026rsquo;s stamp printing complex. | The Stamp Manufacturie  ‚ùñ Read more: The Stamp Manufacturie  As a military organ, the Mail A.r. retains military ranks for its staff, commanded by a Postmaster General and aided by a civilian regulator designed to keep its critical service available to Vekllei people. The Mail\u0026rsquo;s fleet includes dedicated jets, automatic trucks, mail trains, intercity pneumatic systems, vehicle automen, and postmen, all wearing the red and gold colours of the organisation. In total, the Mail delivers nearly 50 million pieces of mail during weekdays.  It is evident that the services assigned to the Mail by the postwar constitution are of critical importance to the stability of Vekllei society. In addition to being one of the oldest active postal organisations in the world, the Royal Mail of Vekllei is tremendously busy, since physical post has scarcely been displaced by the telephone in the country. Even without the Mail\u0026rsquo;s international postage, domestic mail each day can exceed 12 million pieces \u0026ndash; enough for 1 in 2 people, though commercial mail and periodicals are included.\nAs is typical for critical bureaus in Vekllei, the Mail alleviates the stress of daily service through its dense, vertically-integrated infrastructure aided by automatic (automen vehicles) and permanent fixtures (pneumatic systems and automatic sorting/franking machines). It is precisely this commitment to infrastructure that makes the Mail so visible in daily life, and contributes to its ongoing legacy as Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s oldest running government institution.\nStaff    The Mail employs 48,960 people full-time across its various offices, and nearly 200,000 automen in various roles. Although the Mail does retain a staff of postmen and couriers, most urban daily service is now provided by automatic vehicles and sorting, which account for nearly half of the total automen owned by the organisation. Instead, the majority of Mail employees are involved in the running of the organisation \u0026ndash; mostly as clerks, managers, and administrators. Around 10,000 postmen are employed by the Mail in daily delivery, called \u0026ldquo;posties\u0026rdquo;. There are around 8,000 postal routes in the country.\nAlthough at first glance the number of automen dramatically exceeds demand, the total count is misleading \u0026ndash; most automen with the Mail are integrated into the infrastructure of its sorting centres and post offices, and very few are traditionally autonomous robots commonly seen in public in Vekllei. Only about 8,000 automen are employed in physical mail delivery.\nThere are 16,220 post boxes in Vekllei, which are iconic for their red and gold paint and intricate detailing.\nFleet ‚ùñ Read more: The Fairie  The Mail retains a large and diverse fleet of vehicles in regular operations, which, due to their diversity and and expense, have become iconic around the world. From bicycles to space planes, the Mail\u0026rsquo;s fleet of vehicles rivals in diversity postal services three times its size, largely benefitted by Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s obfuscated budgeting system and cultural importance afforded to the organisation.\nThe following table lists company vehicles relevant to regular postal service.\nThe Royal Mail Fleet  Postal Service Bureau  8,000 delivery automen 5,200 motorcycles (mostly Local Electric Model 15 \u0026amp; Phantoms) 2,400 bicycles 2,000 automatic vans 400 mail trucks 31 mail boats (MBR) 20 mail flying boats (Model 54 \u0026ldquo;Fairie\u0026rdquo;) 16 mail helijets (Model RM/Gisma \u0026amp; Record types) 15 mail trains (RM Series/Series 225 EMU) 8 mail trams (Series T6) 2 mail space planes (G.A.

Even without the Mail\u0026rsquo;s international postage, domestic mail each day can exceed 12 million pieces \u0026ndash; enough for 1 in 2 people, though commercial mail and periodicals are included.\nAs is typical for critical bureaus in Vekllei, the Mail alleviates the stress of daily service through its dense, vertically-integrated infrastructure aided by automatic (automen vehicles) and permanent fixtures (pneumatic systems and automatic sorting/franking machines). It is precisely this commitment to infrastructure that makes the Mail so visible in daily life, and contributes to its ongoing legacy as Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s oldest running government institution.\nStaff    The Mail employs 48,960 people full-time across its various offices, and nearly 200,000 automen in various roles. Although the Mail does retain a staff of postmen and couriers, most urban daily service is now provided by automatic vehicles and sorting, which account for nearly half of the total automen owned by the organisation. Instead, the majority of Mail employees are involved in the running of the organisation \u0026ndash; mostly as clerks, managers, and administrators. Around 10,000 postmen are employed by the Mail in daily delivery, called \u0026ldquo;posties\u0026rdquo;. There are around 8,000 postal routes in the country.\nAlthough at first glance the number of automen dramatically exceeds demand, the total count is misleading \u0026ndash; most automen with the Mail are integrated into the infrastructure of its sorting centres and post offices, and very few are traditionally autonomous robots commonly seen in public in Vekllei. Only about 8,000 automen are employed in physical mail delivery.\nThere are 16,220 post boxes in Vekllei, which are iconic for their red and gold paint and intricate detailing.\nFleet ‚ùñ Read more: The Fairie  The Mail retains a large and diverse fleet of vehicles in regular operations, which, due to their diversity and and expense, have become iconic around the world. From bicycles to space planes, the Mail\u0026rsquo;s fleet of vehicles rivals in diversity postal services three times its size, largely benefitted by Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s obfuscated budgeting system and cultural importance afforded to the organisation.\nThe following table lists company vehicles relevant to regular postal service.\nThe Royal Mail Fleet  Postal Service Bureau  8,000 delivery automen 5,200 motorcycles (mostly Local Electric Model 15 \u0026amp; Phantoms) 2,400 bicycles 2,000 automatic vans 400 mail trucks 31 mail boats (MBR) 20 mail flying boats (Model 54 \u0026ldquo;Fairie\u0026rdquo;) 16 mail helijets (Model RM/Gisma \u0026amp; Record types) 15 mail trains (RM Series/Series 225 EMU) 8 mail trams (Series T6) 2 mail space planes (G.A.

Vekllei is criss-crossed by hundreds of different rail lines of various gauges, grades, and purposes. In fact, it runs many lines at a total loss, often undercapacity. To understand these inefficiencies is to understand why the National Rail exists, and to some extent, how Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s state assets and powerful bureaus shape life in the country today.  T he National Rail of Vekllei (VNR) is a catch-all term for bureau-backed, state-owned rail operators of Vekllei. In casual use, it refers to the Vekllei National Railway A.r.R. and its sister companies, like Vekllei Metro, which are structured within the service-oriented Railways Bureau. More precisely, Vekllei National Rail encompasses several different bureaus that operate, design, maintain and communicate rail service in the country, which itself is further included under the Transport Requisite of the Vekllei Government.\nLike most critical organisations of Vekllei, the structure and directorship of Vekllei National Rail is complex, but can be simplified by understanding that all rail transport in the country is ultimately the responsibility of an organisation called Vekllei National Rail, and it is towards this organ that this article is addressed. Today, the National Rail operates nearly 20,000km of track, indicating the density of the rail service it provides, and services nearly 20 million people each day through its network.\nIntroduction A map of the rail network and boroughs of Vekllei, showcasing maglev (red), high-speed (yellow), regional (orange) and local (brown) lines | 100 Boroughs  Since nationalisation of the private Vekllei rail companies in 1925, the structure and reach of Vekllei National Rail has changed several times. Operated as a for-profit enterprise at a historical loss, the National Rail\u0026rsquo;s history of service is reflected in the variety of trains and track gauges it maintains.\nVekllei is unique in the density of its rail, a feature of deliberate postwar city planning and the Home Island\u0026rsquo;s history as an industrial port city-state. Very few Vekllei people own automobiles, and trains remain by far the most common method of travel in the country. Because of this, the rail network in metropolitan areas is extraordinarily dense, and is designed to offer access to nearly every residence in urban areas. This fact also explains the presence of dedicated rail lines to small towns and villages that would otherwise not justify their maintenance. As visible on the map above, the passenger rail network in Vekllei is unsurpassed in its density, which contributes to the dependence Vekllei people have on their trains.\nSimilarly, almost all freight is run along rails of varying gauges. These range from conventional freight trains at standard gauge, to municipal delivery trains at metre guage, and even narrow gauges for moving freight and equipment within large factory complexes. Most major stores and grocers are arranged along freight lines with dedicated sidings, or have their own narrow-gauge tracks dedicated to their use.\nUnusually, Vekllei National Rail is legally absolved of all non-rail transport, and possesses no busses or ferries for public use, which are operated and maintained by dedicated adjacent bureaus.\nHistory A Lesvesn 59-Series EMU arrives in the village of Cult | Shrine-Minded Girls  Although Vekllei has used wagonways since the 18th Century and developed horse-drawn railways for industrial transport in its ports, the first passenger rail line in Vekllei was founded in 1855 by the Pharos Rail Company.\nThe history of rail in Vekllei can be summarised in three key eras of development.\n  Early Development and expansion, from early service in 1855. Late Junta/Prewar nationalisation, from nationalisation in 1925. Postwar refounding and development, since independence in 2015.   Since the foundation of VNR after nationalisation, rail in Vekllei has seen the scale of its passenger rail networks quadruple in size. It is internationally regarded for its safety and reliability.\nEarly Development The first railways in Vekllei developed alongside its ports, as Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s position as an intermediary free port between Europe and the Americas rapidly developed Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s industrial base. Although the earliest internal rail wagons were pulled by horses, primitive steam locomotives had modernised most ports by the early 19th Century.\nThe first passenger rail line opened in 1855 between Pharos and the present-day borough of Little Vekllei to alleviate the expense of moving goods from the Pharos Port to established settlement further inland. The original line was only a few kilometres long, but was extended in 1858 and again in 1872. By this time, several other lines had been established under private rail companies, including passenger services between Vekllei Proper and Little Vekllei, as well as the beginnings of the Montre-Vekllei Railroad.\nBy the beginning of the 20th Century, Vekllei had a half-dozen major railroad companies, and dozens other limited/local services provided by private operators or their municipality. This saw a massive increase in both the movement of freight and ridership, and helped entrench Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s position as a stopover port city for transatlantic freight and passage.\nNationalisation The early 20th Century was marked by an exponential increase in ridership, which saw a proliferation of new railroads across the Home Islands. Metropolitan and suburban lines during this period were characterised by overcrowding, poor reliability and irregular service. These factors, in addition to the growing economic power of rail barons in the country, saw the Atlantic Junta (known as the Crown) move to nationalise all metropolitan and intercity passenger rail service in 1925 as the Vekllei National Rail Company (VNC).\nThe centralisation of Vekllei rail accompanied standardisation of its commuter track gauge, which improved travel times across the country. The VNC period was characterised by reliable investment and a commitment to modernisation of rail in the country. By the late 20th Century, the Vekllei Metropolitan Underground was widely regarded as one of the most beautiful subway systems in the world.\nIn the late 1980s, VNC started work on what would eventually become the Vekllei-Montre bullet train. The programme overran its cost estimates and was delayed several times, and was not completed until 2004, shortly before the Atomic War.\nPostwar Development National Rail Company assets that had been operated by the occupation Vekllei Provisional Government were transferred to the Vekllei Interim Government in 2015 and reestablished as Vekllei National Rail (VNR) in 2018. The Floral Period has been marked by steady growth in ridership and the scale of its network. The organisation also invests heavily into the development of new locomotives and EMUs, culminating in 2047 with the announcement of the Vekllei East Coast Maglev Scheme, which are the fastest commuter trains in the world.\nIn 2055, VNR celebrated \u0026ldquo;250 years of rail,\u0026rdquo; and its livery and staff uniforms were overhauled to mark the occasion.\nToday, VNR represents the sole means of medium/long-distance transport for over 80% of Vekllei commuters, indicating its continuous status as a monopoly of travel, not just rail, in the country.\nStructure Vekllei National Rail is an organ of the Transport Requisite of the Vekllei Government (A.r.R., or requoisesiasn amourisocietie resmesnghet) as several individual state requisite bureaus, which in turn are charged with different transport companies. Although its structure in Vekllei might be analogous to a government ministry abroad, it functions in practice more like a state-owned enterprise with private subsidiaries. It is not a state-run corporation, and maintains seperate accounting.\nVekllei National Rail is administered through three State Requisites: the Vekllei National Rail itself including all regular operations and rail service, the National Rail Insurance Scheme which finances construction through Government White Bonds, and the Rail Safety Commission.\nVekllei National Rail  Vekllei National Rail  Vekllei Railways Bureau  Palace of Rail  Vekllei National Railway A.r.R.

It is somehow exempted from the public apathy and resentment of bureaucracy that targets other monopolies of the Vekllei state, and is routinely regarded as among the most beloved and appreciated \u0026ldquo;companies\u0026rdquo; in Vekllei.  Access to public transport is considered a \u0026ldquo;critical luxury\u0026rdquo; of the Vekllei state (the Vekllei turn-of-phrase for essential state services) and, by extension, the functioning of its society. By design, it makes no profit, and is subsidised entirely by the Transport Requisite of the Vekllei Government and various independent transport bureaus for the benefit of any Vekllei person. Even prior to the war and investment of the Floral Period, Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s public transport was widely regarded as among the finest of any network in the world thanks to its impeccable safety record, timeliness, and comprehensive coverage.\nRail transport contributes tremendously to the national culture and common affection for Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s public institutions. It is also commonly percieved as a triumph of the postwar floral Period, despite rail history in Vekllei dating back hundreds of years prior. The ongoing expansion of the VNR network and renovation of stations and railhubs commands attention internationally, which is watching Vekllei celebrate its golden age of rail.\nNational Rail National rail access is generally provided directly by Vekllei National Railway A.r.R. through a branch office dependent on the location. The Home Islands are served by VNR Atlantic, whereas Kala is served by VNR Overseas. The Home Islands house thousands of rural villages outside of urban metropolitan service, and Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s dependence on rail transportatiion demands their inclusion in the VNR network. As such, almost every village in Vekllei has a rail line or interurban tramway, and villages as small as 20 persons see daily service to the capital.\nMetropolitan Service \u0026amp; Subways The majority of VNR\u0026rsquo;s ~10,000 trains per day run in metro or subway services throughout Vekllei urban and interurban routes. These lines are primarily serviced by the EMU workhorses of the VNR fleet, particularly 56 and 59-Series trainsets. In urban centers, VNR service is frequent enough to be unscheduled, with trains arriving every other minute or so.\nThe majority of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s underground metro network has been automated by Automatic Train Control, an industrial automan system that allows for driverless trains. Although still serviced by VNR platform staff with training to stop the train in emergencies, Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s automatic metros are otherwise entirely driverless. VNR Overseas metros in Kala and the Kalina Isles retain drivers.\nTramways Vekllei operates a variety of trams and streetcars, including double-decker street-level units in the capital region and so-called \u0026ldquo;fast trams\u0026rdquo; (inter-urban cars) outside of the cities. Depending on the make and route of the tramway, they may be grade-seperated or integrated into streets. Their ubuquity in urban areas has caused observers to regard them as the principle method of transport in the country, second only to the bicycle.\nFreight VNR\u0026rsquo;s main freight lines run mostly on a seperate gauge and network, and are composed of several companies that operate regionally across a variety of locomotive types and industries. These include traditional freight locomotives and long/short cars, as well as freight trams and wagons used to transport goods around and between factories.\nOperations ‚ùñ Read more: Station Logic  VNR is typical of a \u0026lsquo;great Vekllei bureau\u0026rsquo; \u0026ndash; it instills national pride, is well-run and maintained, and loses tremendous amounts of money. It is the crown jewel of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s insolvent organs, whose thin profit margins and charming inefficiencies are tolerated and even encouraged in this society which subsidises social benefit above all else.  Nearly 17 million people per day commute via VNR\u0026rsquo;s networks each day, making up a majority of the Vekllei population. In this sense, VNR\u0026rsquo;s quality of operations affects the Vekllei person more than the quality of their government. In addition to commuter service, VNR automatic freight transit systems are the lifeblood of all industry and commerce in the country, and are regulated directly as a state requisite for their critical importance to the functioning of Vekllei society.\nVNR operates 2,114 stations across the Home Islands, which vary from uncovered concrete platforms to tremendous terminus complexes that cover multiple city blocks. The largest station in the country, Vekllei Central, sees over 1 million people per day pass through its gates.\nVekllei\u0026rsquo;s stations are well-regarded for the beauty and decoration overseas. As part of the Millenia Rail campaign in the mid-21st Century, VNR initiated a dramatic overhaul of its passenger infrastructure, restoring heritage-listed station interiors and renovating much of the early postwar metro construction with murals, new lighting, enlarged caverns and shafts, and improved safety features. The cleanliness and safety of Vekllei National Railway is a great point of pride in the country, and in part justifies VNR\u0026rsquo;s tremendous fiscal losses in daily operation.\nVNR services are mostly unticketed, and as a Vekllei industry, are free to ride.\nStaff ‚ùñ Read more: The People of Vekllei National Rail  VNR employs 65,240 people, which include roles ranging from locomotive engineers and platform staff to editors of rail enthusiast periodicals. It is also one of the largest employers of 12-16 year olds in the country, via its Station Apprentice programme, unique among organisations of its size.\nThe organisation is administered by the President of the Rail Central Office, which is responsible to the Transport Requisite and the Palace of Rail. VNR has a close relationship with bureau and petty-bureau coachbuilders, and wields considerable power in Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s heavy industries as a major manufacturing partner.\nFleet ‚ùñ Download the VNR Rolling Stock List (PDF)  Vekllei National Rail is perhaps unsurpassed in its variety of trainsets and their length of service. An unofficial policy of preservation has ensured that every unit type since the 1980s has seen an ongoing minor presence in current service. VNR rarely retires a trainset completely \u0026ndash; in keeping with the contemporary cultural-political valuation of machines, a few units of each model are retained on various lines for their historical and technical significance. This includes steam locomotives, which continue to operate regular passengers service on some routes.\nThe backbone of the contemporary Vekllei rail fleet is the Electric Multiple Units (EMUs), which are designated by their year of manufacture.1 In particular, the 56 and 59-Series trainsets make up the majority of EMUs in service today, as they exclusively populate primary commuter lines in Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s southwest. VNR also retains Diesel Multiple Units (DMUs) in its long-haul cold-weather routes, particularly in the Afouisneh region and Kala.\nVNR pioneered super-conductive maglev transport for mass consumption, and its SC3 trainsets are the fastest in regular service in the world today, reaching nearly 750km/h in places. Its slowest locomotive, the T400 2-6-2 steam locomotive Small Movements built in 1928, averages just 30km/h on its tourist route in rural Krafla. VNR is also experimenting with nuclear-powered trainsets, but none have so far entered public testing.\nNotes   Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;war\u0026rsquo; prefix is used as a designation for pre-war railcars and locomotives, transliterated from the native word for the Junta\u0026rsquo;s society.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/society/rail/","title":"Rail"},{"content":"Two Puffin Scouts rest in a flower-tundra, a place of great spiritual significance in Vekllei. | Memory and Death in the Flower Tundra  ﬂ∑ This article is about Vekllei  1. Overview Upen is the nondenominational animistic spiritualism of Vekllei. It is both an organised religious belief system and a decentralised local animism, localised regionally across the Home Islands and beyond. As a basis for Vekllei metaphysics and general belief systems, Upen is a central part of Vekllei cultural identity and informs most parts of life at all levels in the country.  U pen is the animistic, nondenominational dominant and historical religion of Vekllei. Practiced commonly throughout the Home Islands and Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s possessions, it is a core component of Vekllei culture and heritage, and has existed in various forms for thousands of years. Because Upen is fundamentally provincial and decentralised, its scripture and practice vary significantly between boroughs. Most forms emphasise object animism, impermanence, petite materialism, land dependence, existentialism and fear of nature.\nUpen can be practiced at natural shrines, usually designated by a cairn, at running or still water, or the seaside. Maritime living and seafood are important aspects of Vekllei life, and fishing and ocean myths are key elements in Upen. Within its spiritualism, traditional folk-tales and scripture are called sagas, which have also archived much of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s early history.\nAlthough traditionally atheist, Upen is commonly adopted by immigrant populations that include Catholic, Jewish and Buddhist faiths. In these contexts, Upen\u0026rsquo;s animism and dependence on landscape is held alongside traditional beliefs, which are so common postwar that both Jewish and Catholic metaphysics have appeared in mainstream Upen doctrine in some cities, where large immigrant populations reside.\nIntroduction Tzipora stands in traditional Upen dress before an offerings box. | Spiritful  You can find Upen all around you in Vekllei since, by its own spiritual metaphysics, animism is not human. It exists independently of human understanding or spirit, and Upen is merely the practice by which humans are cognisant and interact with the spirit of things. Wherever people and material existence collide, including man-made objects, you find Upen.\nIn this sense, Upen can be understood as having two distinct forms, practiced differently depending on the occasion:\n Public Upen, which involves priests, communities, ceremony and cultural artefacts (like Upotenne and Rapotenne). Public Upen manifests similarly to other faiths, in which sites of worship, historical texts and sacred spaces inform practice and understanding. Private Upen, which involves personal understanding and direct physicality with the aspects of material being Upen holds sacred, namely the spirit of all things and the human form.  Although Upen does retain priests informally, it lacks a hierarchical structure and is largely agnostic towards organised religion, lived and practiced instead through traditions, folklore, lifestyle and metaphysics.\nAs atheistic and animistic, Upen shelters landscape from becoming ‚Äòsimply nature‚Äô, as it does when viewed as a product of a monotheistic creator god. Within Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;landscape\u0026rsquo; agnosticism, nature is not ‚Äòsimply nature‚Äô; it is a spiritual vessel in itself, inalienable and inextricably linked to human purpose and satisfaction. Industry is divorced from the whole concept; it is a country of forest commons, collective stewardship, and volcanic unrest.\n2. Etymology Upen as a word has its origins lost to time, but its linguistic characteristics can be found throughout modern Vekllei language. U (pronounced \u0026lsquo;oo\u0026rsquo;) is a prefix applied to matters of consciousness considered sacred or special, as replicated in the spirit-language of Upotenne. Upen likely has origins in a proto-Islandi language called Kala, which later was absorbed into Topyas, the predecessor to Vekllei.\nIn modern usage, Upen refers to both the faith and metaphysic of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s local animism, as well as a general indicator for Vekllei faith, myth and traditional folklore.\nThis article is currently under construction, and will soon feature more information about Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s spiritualism.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/culture/religion/","title":"Religion"},{"content":"‚ùñ Note from the Editor\nThe bulletin was an experiment created in May 2020 to supplement content posted to reddit.

Tzipora (Zelda) Desmoisnes Fact Sheet     Tzipora lo Ula de Helette Desmoisnes     Birthday May 5th 2047, Lava, Royal Borough of Lava, Vekllei   Nationality Vekllei, Colombian   Spouses None   Children None   Parents Mette Sumoisnesn, unknown father   Education Lola 6th School, Montre National University   Occupation Student, Librarian, Gregori Baby   Military Service Floral Assistant, 2nd Garden Corps, Royal Vekllei Armed Forces   Civilian Awards National Award for Heroism in Local Service (twice)   Sigil Mustard Orchid      Tzipora lo Ula de Helette Desmoisnes is the main character and character utopia of this project. Often called Zelda by her friends, she is the protagonist of Atomic Modern and a significant person within Vekllei. Although born in Vekllei, Tzipora was raised overseas in Colombia and later educated in the United States. It was not until her return to Vekllei in her teen-age years that she was formally diagnosed with Gregori Syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects her ageing and renders her biologically immortal. Since her arrival in Vekllei, she has formed sincere and long-lasting relationships in her homeland, stabilising her life and making her happy.\nAppearance Tzipora is blue-eyed and black-haired of mixed Inuit-Scandinavian and Eastern-European heritage. She has a round head and a big smile, and a skinny frame attributed in part to a childish metabolism retained through Gregori-Heitzfeld Syndrome, from which she suffers. She parts her short hair in the centre and ornaments it with fountain hairpieces, traditional hair loops and floral assemblies depending on the occasion. She is most remembered for her youthful appearance, since she does not age beyond late prepubescence as a consequence of her genetic condition. Despite this, she retains a serious, cultivated manner and alternates disconcertingly between youthful hyperactivity and careful, deliberate physicality.\nShe dresses in conservative fashions and has maintained a consistent taste throughout her life. She has a weakness for loose clothing, particularly buttoned shirts, slacks and skirts of various styles. She is most commonly seen in a pleated white shirt, modest skirt, folded socks and penny loafers.\nPersonality Tzipora is nonconformist by way of ignorance or obstinance depending on the occasion.\nShe is paranoid and conservative, good-natured and austere, with a moral outlook bound by her deepest anxieties and obsessions. She is deeply spiritual and material, fascinated with objects and their history. She has many collections of many things she‚Äôs found. She‚Äôll likely die a Catholic, but has a confrontational relationship with God and no longer attends mass. She does not know if this has pissed Him off, but it‚Äôs working out so far. Maybe that‚Äôs why He made her a homosexual ‚Äî to get back at her. He must have a good sense of humour, if that‚Äôs the case.\nTzipora may be intense and inward-facing, but she can also be disarmingly charming and self-deprecating. She has a good sense of humour. There are not many girls that can so easily reconcile the contradictions between the peculiar and the healthy, the eccentric and the friendly, and the violent and the domestic. That‚Äôs part of her character ‚Äî an essence of being that radiates decency, good taste and a respect for the spirit of all things.\n3.

Medal for Love to the Sick and Dying   Sigil Golden Bliss Flower      Cobian lo Ro de Viviya de Queismesnah is Tzipora\u0026rsquo;s longtime friend and occasional girlfriend. Conservative in manner and appearance, Cobian is easily remembered by her circular spectacles and stern fringe, styles maintained since childhood. Tzipora and Cobian met during secondary schooling in Vekllei, and remained close throughout the rest of their lives. She is very close with Tzipora, but has tepid relationships with Tzipora\u0026rsquo;s mostly male friendship group out of jealousy and a general distaste for boys. She is rigorously polite in the middle-class sense of the word; formal among strangers, gossipy among friends.\nAppearance Cobian is green-eyed and black-haired, descendent mostly from Inuit-Scandinavian ethnic groups common in Vekllei. She is more Asiatic in appearance than her friend Zelda, and is tall for her age. She styles her long hair in many different ways, most commonly in a bun or braids. She is healthy but inactive, and tans easily without freckling. Cobian is naturally graceful and well-mannered, traits Tzipora is deeply envious of.\nShe dresses in prim, well-maintained clothing courtesy of her despotically hygienic mother, and has a penchant for ironed shirts, pleatless skirts, synthetic hosiery and jewellery she considers befitting a maturing young woman.\nPersonality When Tzipora meets her, Cobian is a figure of sympathy and irritation. She was deeply insecure after old friendships fell apart in the tumultuous transition between middle and secondary schooling. Once she became comfortable around her new friend and matured out of some old insecurities, Cobian revealed herself to be easy-going and friendly, a person of small pretensions and genuine friendship. In her own skin, she makes an excellent conversationalist, charmingly attentive and ready to listen.\nSome people think she\u0026rsquo;s pretentious; she\u0026rsquo;s not pretentious. She likes good food and is highly fashionable in her interests and styles, but Cobian is also deeply empathetic and finds interest in new things via her friends she\u0026rsquo;d never previously thought about. She makes up most of Tzipora\u0026rsquo;s social life, which leaves plenty of space for Zelda\u0026rsquo;s big personality and obsessions. Zelda has a deeply stablising effect on Cobian, rounding out some of her mother\u0026rsquo;s strict legacy through Zelda\u0026rsquo;s androgynous habits and far-fetched fascinations. But Zelda\u0026rsquo;s big personality does not include much talking or grace, and in these deficiencies Cobian\u0026rsquo;s social talent shines. Together they make a great pair, their neighbouring personalities aiding their best selves.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/future/","title":"The Future of Vekllei"},{"content":"","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/","title":"Utopia"},{"content":"‚ùñ Note from the Editor This article was originally published in October 2019. It offers an analysis of Evelyn Waugh\u0026rsquo;s Handful of Dust through an anti-utopian prism.  Waugh‚Äôs Handful of Dust as Anti-Utopia W augh\u0026rsquo;s A Handful of Dust has remarkable topography. The word can be extrapolated in this case in several ways; for one, the book is occupied by worldly, secular affairs, inextricably bound to a particular cultural landscape and absence of metaphysic. Further, as a satirical novel of deep conservative utopian lament, there is a physical, temporal dimension to its present context and history. Finally, the topography of Waugh\u0026rsquo;s novel can be taken literally, as a landscape of modernity (cities) and counter-modernity (rural life), modernism (civilisation) and anti-modernism (savagery). Because of this, there is a playful relationship with Waugh\u0026rsquo;s anti-utopian world and his utopian instincts ‚Äî one that warrants closer analysis. This essay will focus on the dichotomous, often schismatic landscapes at play in A Handful of Dust, and situate it in a modern utopian framework.\nIt is easiest to understand A Handful of Dust in a utopian context when the reader first recognises the novel as a worldview, or as Edward Lobb1 calls it, a ‚Äùpicture of an entire society,‚Äù citing Waugh\u0026rsquo;s employment of Eliot\u0026rsquo;s Waste Land in its title and epigraph p.130. This scope is almost invariably unsentimental, especially in satirical works, and this quirk of genre is calcified into something more deliberate when looking at the novel‚Äôs literary context, which Peter Firchow recognised as a deliberate rejection of Victorian sentimentalism and moral arbitration as characterised by Dickensian literature2 p.415. The satirical edge of the novel‚Äôs climax is only shallowly buried; Nicholas Joost wrote that ‚Äúbeneath the incongruity, there is a chilling propriety. The relationship between Mr Todd and Tony is as Dickensian in kind and proportion as is that between Miss Havisham and Estella in Great Expectations.‚Äù3 p.186\nThe Waugh landscape is marked by unusual topography, where people and places are made foreign through their own alienation from purpose and time. Tony is a secular humanist (evidenced through his irreverence towards faith throughout the novel) dependent parasitically on the romantic nostalgia for the restrained way of life under the Judea-Christian tradition, without the metaphysic provided by pious faith1 p.133. Brenda is a modern woman attached socially and historically to London, the icon of modern (and Victorian) life, which informs her unfaithfulness and various missteps. In fact, nearly every character in the novel suffers from a kind of displacement of both place and intention, which in Waugh\u0026rsquo;s parody of a humanist framework forces a series of unfortunate events that unfold throughout. This all takes place, of course, in the tumultuousness of the interwar years, marked first by hedonism and excess in the 1920s and instability and poverty in the 1930s, the decade in which A Handful of Dust was written. H.G. Wells in his 1933 novel The Shape of Things to Come called it \u0026ldquo;The Age of Frustration,‚Äù for the vast cultural and political changes threatening an unravelling of the world. Waugh, like many of his fellow British authors (including Eliot, Orwell, and Wells himself), hedged existential concerns about the state of his homeland in his work.\nA Handful of Dust is distracted from pure reactionary critique by the (in his mind) far more egregious severing of morality from the metaphysic, and the adoption of previously Judeo-Christian ethics by secular, ungrounded humanist movements. Tony is estranged from real spiritual purpose or existential satisfaction by his secularity and passivity. He spends most of the novel surprised and wounded by sharp moments of tragedy only to be utterly unequipped to deal with them in his total vacuum of Self. In fact, his worldview is less an empty epistemological constellation than it is a fog where no stars or points of reference are visible at all. This culminates, of course, in his ironic fate, in which his old material life essentially reasserts itself in an absurd parody, where his fake, superficial Dickensian existence is resumed against his will in the jungles of Brazil. Quite literally, to Lobb, ‚Äúhis reading of Dickens is a reversion to Victorian sentimentality‚Äù1 p.135, concluding spatially in the same meaningless fantasy as his life at Hetton Abbey.\nSuch is the Waugh‚Äôs illustration of the world in the Age of Frustration, and his fundamental alienation from it. The novel contains not merely glimpses of anti-utopias, but in fact presents a particular anti-utopian philosophy, which can be inverted to better clarify the images of utopia present throughout the work. For example, even though the novel has clear misgivings about the state of England in the late 1930s, the utopian foundation on which A Handful of Dust is built upon nonetheless participates in a philosophy of place, gesturing towards a conservative progression of history. After all, it is not just the revolutionary that understands history as an arc of progress ‚Äî liberals and conservatives alike recognise the horizon, but disagree on the changes made to meet it. Walter Benjamin illustrated this idea cleanly in 1940:\n Progress, as it was painted in the minds of the social democrats, was once upon a time the progress of humanity itself (not only that of its abilities and knowledges). It was, secondly, something unending (something corresponding to an endless perfectibility of humanity). It counted, thirdly, as something essentially unstoppable (as something self-activating, pursuing a straight or spiral path).4 pp.9-10\n Waugh‚Äôs conservatism in a utopian context thus reveals interesting temporal locations through the framework built by sociologist Karl Mannheim. Conservatism, and to a lesser extent liberalism, are fundamentally \u0026ldquo;socially congruent\u0026rdquo; utopias (as opposed, Mannheim supposes, to the socially transcendent topos of the radical and anarchic). White5 expands on this classification, explaining that the differences among utopian sectors \u0026ldquo;are matters more of emphasis than of content,‚Äù since all are fundamentally agents of change p.25. All utopias are efforts to envision and manifest a shift in politics or culture, either consciously in praxis or unconsciously as a collection of values and ideas. Under White\u0026rsquo;s summary, conservatives (to whom Waugh undeniably belongs) are \u0026ldquo;inclined to imagine historical evolution as a progressive elaboration of the institutional structure that currently prevails,\u0026rdquo; where anarchic/radical utopias tend to treat utopia as a non-temporal phenomena that is essentially timeless, dependent only on man\u0026rsquo;s ability to wrest control of their own humanity. Thus is the distinction between ideology and utopia in the inversion characteristic of Mannheim\u0026rsquo;s definitions, where ideology proves socially useful but practically impossible, and utopia is necessary in genuine social change as an element whose \u0026ldquo;ideas and values in which are contained in condensed form the unrealised and the unfulfilled tendencies which represent the needs of each age.\u0026quot;5 p.179 It marks a break from the lineage of utopia\u0026rsquo;s etymology from More\u0026rsquo;s original Utopia. Particularly relevant to Waugh\u0026rsquo;s work here is utopia as a practicable element of social change, as Mannheim writes6 p.178 \u0026ldquo;the road of history leads from one topia over a utopia to the next topia, etc.\u0026rdquo;\nWith Mannheim\u0026rsquo;s redefinition in mind, it is important to assert A Handful of Dust\u0026rsquo;s place in this epistemology. Phillip Wegner notes that the four utopian mentalities outlined by Mannheim (conservative, liberal, radical, and anarchic) are in fact present within their own \u0026ldquo;mode of historical consciousness,\u0026rdquo; existing independently while \u0026ldquo;representing a critical \u0026lsquo;counter-utopia\u0026rsquo; to its three competitors\u0026rdquo; 7 p.192. In this sense, Waugh\u0026rsquo;s conservative utopia is less a concrete set of values and principles than it is a device for clarifying the horizons of political imagination, dynamically reacting to and reflecting the other three corners of possibility.\nYou can see these possibilities through the further inversion of the anti-utopia, like the cyclical nature of faithless humanism. In the case of Tony, the interjection of reality into his absurd fantasy results in an eternity of Hetton-style superficiality manifested literally through Victorian moralism. John Beaver, still materialistic and dependent on his ‚Äúmumsy,‚Äù leaves Britain only to presumably carry on in decadence in Californiap.176. Brenda‚Äôs desire for excitement and romantic satisfaction, meanwhile, leave her alone in the city and without money to sponsor a colourful lifestyle (Characteristically, Waugh does not mince words: ‚ÄúIt was August and she was entirely alone,‚Äùp.193). By the end of the novel, in which the characters themselves are as unresolved as the arc of the story itself, it is clear that the spiritual emptiness that subsumes the purpose of these people is not merely thematic, but is in fact a clarified anti-utopia in itself, not as place but as ‚Äúbody utopias‚Äù 8 p.4. Or rather, anti-utopias of spiritual/sensual gratification. These are people who have no connection to anything fixed or meaningful in their own pasts or culture.\nThis reassessment of utopian writing acknowledges A Handful of Dust not as mere satire for satire‚Äôs sake, but as in fact a vessel of practicable ideas well within potentiality for a hypothetical conservative utopia. After all, should the interwar years have been marked by a series of different events, who is to say Britain might not have become marked at a national cultural level the kind of reactionary nostalgia visible in Waugh\u0026rsquo;s novel? It is not, after all, a simple utopia of place. Jean Ward9 p.679 describes the vision of the novel as a story of \u0026ldquo;human selfishness and self-delusion,\u0026rdquo; in contrast to a simpler misanthropic adventure of human misfortune. This characterisation better illustrates Waugh\u0026rsquo;s pointed absence of framework, or metaphysic, for the world depicted.\nAfter all, it is not as though people will cease to fall out of love, or commit adultery, or accidentally maim children in a world built upon Catholic social norms and the accompanying spiritual bedrock. Nor is it reasonable to suggest Waugh\u0026rsquo;s nostalgia for a pre-war (or pre-modern) England would be blind to the fact that human moral failure would continue to exist. But in the worldview of A Handful of Dust, the characters shown are merely symptomatic of a global cheapness, a sort of international hedonism, that is presented as a sort of era without end. Ann Slater10 notes the novel\u0026rsquo;s displacement of people and intention, citing a recurring motif in which a well-meaning or pleasurable thing is made bad and uncomfortable by its displacementpp.49-66. It is not difficult to find examples of this sardonic irony in the text; Brenda\u0026rsquo;s mourning of the wrong personp.118, and Tony\u0026rsquo;s ironic torturous imprisonment (which takes his pleasures and makes them agony)p.210 are just two examples. In fact, the instances of a correct sentiment or honest effort backfiring and causing trouble so thoroughly pervades the Waugh landscape that it becomes an indispensable part of its satirical edge, culminating in its ironic juxtaposition of life in London against Tony\u0026rsquo;s feverish delusions of the city in the jungle. As Slater notes:\n Civilisation and the savage world fuse. London turns into a desert for Brenda, once Beaver leaves for New York and the entire beau monde goes off cruising in the Mediterranean [\u0026hellip;] Tony, on the other hand, discovers that the bush at night is noisier than a city square.10 p.63\n This fusion of anti-utopian landscape, both as a wasteland composed of good intentions and a jungle of bad outcomes, is an interesting illustration of Waugh\u0026rsquo;s wider satirical targets in the novel. Despite ostensibly satirising the bankruptcy of modern life and its secular humanism, Waugh\u0026rsquo;s ruthless antisentimentality marks A Handful of Dust as a thoroughly modernist novel. Indeed, outside of the aesthetic framework provided by modernism (which Waugh, at least spiritually and politically, rejects), A Handful of Dust was one of many English novels documenting the social disintegration and futility of the modern world. As put by Jonathan Greenburg, ‚ÄúIn Waugh, the satiric and the modem often look very much alike; while the author may claim to satirise a decadent modernity, the disruptive mechanism of his satire fosters the very modem decadence he decries‚Äù11 p.352. The novel is at once a critique and a product of modernism. This dissonance was noted by his biographer as occurring shortly after his entry into the Catholic Church:\n Conversion meant that in one way Waugh had withdrawn from the world of meaninglessness, godlessness, and chaos, yet he remained passionately interested in it, with it if not spiritually or intellectually of it. He could confidently judge and condemn the world he described, but he would not turn away from it.12 p.76\n For Waugh, his conversion equipped him with a worldview that had already been formulating for some years. He was a great believer in the supernatural metaphysics of the Church as a place of order and stability12 p.76, and this would colour his personal politics as well as his personal writing, as well as condemn in his eyes the mortal and material desires of those without faith. A Handful of Dust is a work particularly relevant to his conversion, since an oft-cited quote of his declares the the novel ‚Äúwas humanist and contained all I had to say about humanism.‚Äù13 p.118. According to John Cunningham, ‚Äúin this novel he considered the dead end of a humanism that supposes one may have a moral purpose and yet have no metaphysic in which that purpose is grounded.‚Äùp.118. It was not just a humanist topography in which A Handful of Dust was situated, however. In understanding utopia as a function of place as well as form, it becomes clear that the anti-utopia of the novel is multidimensional, incorporating criticisms of topos as well as body.\nIn his seminal work on the origins of landscape and historicism, Karatani Kojin wrote, \u0026ldquo;in the very moment when we become capable of perceiving landscape, it appears to us as if it had been there, outside of us, from the start‚Äù14 p.34. So too does the iconography of \u0026ldquo;old England\u0026rdquo; illustrated in A Handful of Dust suppress its origins as landscape as soon as it is introduced. Most obviously, the \u0026ldquo;old country\u0026rdquo; of Hetton Abbey is expressed only in transcendental terms and is thoroughly defamiliarised. It is, in effect, not a place at all, but a sham landscape only supported by the value given to it by the Lasts (which further recalls Eliot‚Äôs poem in the epigraph; ‚ÄúThese fragments I have shored against my ruins‚Äù). To further draw on Karatani: ‚ÄúIt brings into existence landscapes which, although they had always been there, had never been seen\u0026rdquo;p.29. This then informs the ability of the novel to set within it subjects and objects of action, as it is important to recognise the subjects and objects of action arise from within a landscape upon discovery, rather than having existed as immutable factsp.34. Tony is thoroughly alienated from landscape as it is depicted in the novel; it is only appropriate, then, that he struggles to find an appropriate metaphysical foundation for his existence. The discovery of landscape predates modernism as Waugh understands it, but it remains in fact a modern creation brought about the artistic and religious reformations of centuries prior (namely protestant reformations, notable in context of Waugh\u0026rsquo;s catholicism). As described by Gleiter:\n The modern Self is indebted to a process of extraneation which is also a process of objectification. Both the landscape and the Self become alien and enigmatic, and these, precisely, are the qualities that made them visible.15 p.73\n Furthermore, Hetton Abbey is acknowledged as a Victorian Gothic reconstruction, a revivalist style that reflects his romantic fetishisation of the preindustrial and rural1 p.131. The investment of his spirit into an inauthentic commodity grotesquely acknowledges his spiritual bankruptcy, which cascades into all parts of his delusions (his inability to respond to the death of his son and his wife\u0026rsquo;s unfaithfulness, etc.). Firchow describes Hetton as ‚Äúroughly from the same period of Dickens‚Äô novels; both seem to represent the last gasping certainties of an old order. And both, by implication, are possibly intended to be recognised as shams‚Äù2 p.415. Even his response to grief is filtered through this plastic understanding of the world, as Tony exclaims, ‚ÄúA whole Gothic world had come to grief.., there was now no armour, glittering in the forest glades, no embroidered feet on the greensward; the cream and dappled unicorns had fled\u0026hellip;\u0026quot;p.147.\nThe reconfiguring of landscape as iconography also enables Waugh to further satirise the characters of the novel, and strip back their agency as a consequence of their own hedonism. Brenda is suffocated socially by Tony‚Äôs blind love for the Abbey; Tony is trapped by Mr Todd in the Brazilian jungle; Mr Todd is trapped by his illiteracy, and so on. Indeed, the book concludes on a cage of silver foxes. Through their social and physical imprisonment, the people of the novel are better illustrated against both the hellish topos and their own critical character flaws that prevent them from breaking out of their cyclical lifestyles. Their spiritual emptiness is reflected in their ability to take the metaphysical institutions of life seriously, and renders them (socially and in their ability to enact change over their own lives) as children10 p.61. John Beaver, in his poverty and dependence on his mother, seems to typify this psychospiritual bankruptcy, but the patronising tone of the novel leaves few characters unmarked. Nowhere is this more apparent than when Jock finally presents the request regarding the importation of pork pies on behalf of his constituents, only to bungle the department to which he was supposed to address it. Waugh‚Äôs sardonic line encloses this caricature of the man: ‚ÄúJock left the House that afternoon with the comfortable feeling that he had at last done something tangible in the interest of his constituents‚Äù.p.216\nWith the intensity of the satirical edge in A Handful of Dust, it is only suitable that its anti-utopian foundations are expressed with great clarity. The defamiliarisation (and often outright absence of sympathy) for the people of this book only serve to better collapse the sort of Victorian sentimentalism to which Waugh seems averse. Just as Tony is isolated from sincere accomplishment of preindustrial, rural nobility by his time in history and material circumstance, so too are his metaphysical aspirations undermined by their baselessness. To the Catholic Waugh, the idea of morals without metaphysic is vacuous and empty of real substance. Similarly, Waugh‚Äôs perceived savagery embedded within civilisation is not just as a condemnation of changing cultural icebergs, but a literalist judgement of the products of modernists ‚Äî that is to say, modern people. Waugh presents a paper landscape and plastic people, and through a simple inversion it easy enough to pull genuine utopian social dreaming from this novel. Utopia undeniably exists in the conservative anti-utopia, and in the case of A Handful of Dust, it invokes a broader context of a unique period of time for British literature, one marked by material uncertainty and cultural retreat. For that reason, Waugh‚Äôs A Handful of Dust is an undeniably important work of fiction, both as a biting critique of modernism (which itself has long-since given way to later movements) and as a zeitgeist for conservative apprehension in a remarkable period of history.

Tzipora-watch It was in July that Tzipora first met Ayn‚Äôs parents, who would quickly assume a role in Tzipora‚Äôs life as her own grandparents. Ayn‚Äôs mother, Ana, is Soviet-Born, and her father, Tony, is a Hong-Konger. Despite her international heritage, Ayn is afraid of both the sea and the sky and has never left Vekllei‚Äôs shores. Tzipora looks forward to spending part of the summer in Yana with Ayn and her grandparents each year.\n III. Vekllei Fact of the Month Vekllei‚Äôs heavy diet of lab-grown meat, called ‚Äòfactory steak‚Äô or eoui demanufacturie is so widespread in cities that many children in the capital region have never eaten meat from a living creature. Its texture and taste, especially after processing, is identical to beef and comes in different forms to replicate different cuts of meat, including fat and gristle. Most ‚Äòreal‚Äô meat in Vekllei cities consists of sweetbreads, offcuts and organs ‚Äî the stuff left over from authentic rural consumption of the prime cuts. Chicken hearts, for example, are eaten by themselves or on a skewer.\n IV. WordBook Iyadaisnesn ‚Äî also called ‚ÄúInsta-skin‚Äù is a collagen scaffold that rapidly seals and then regenerates skin over wounds. It is used medicinally in Vekllei, where it is branded as Iyadaisnesn, and is usually aerosolised and applied to shallow scrapes and grazes to seal the wound and prevent infection. Within a few days, it‚Äôs good as new! A type of Insta-skin is also used by the military, where it is distributed in wet pouches and acts much faster on much more serious wounds.\n V. The Bulletin Meet Tzipora \u0026ndash; concept panel for a Vekllei comic üìñ Published 31st July 2020 | Read here.\nThere are a lot of things Tzipora does differently to everybody else, and they start to make a lot more sense when you realise Tzipora either does not realise she is unusual, or does not care.\nShe has a lot of endearing characteristics that give great character to her mannerisms and physicality. She has a small overbite that makes her look a little froggy, and ritually pulls on her shirt and wipes her nose in anxious conversation. She is round-headed and cuts her hair herself. She talks in a low, expressive voice. She has been poorly socialised in childhood, and is afraid of casual conversation with people she does not know. She is keenly socially attuned and feels awkwardness painfully.\nShe wears the same clothes two or three days in a row. The outfits themselves are variations of the same thing, and her tastes don‚Äôt change. Everything hangs off her ‚Äî she likes baggy, airy clothing, and upsizes to accomodate. She doesn‚Äôt like fashionable or voguish people, whom she regards as decadent and offensive. To Tzipora, taste is timeless and bound to the soul. In her case, this fact has held true ‚Äî she has dressed the same as childhood, and very little else has changed about her in that time.\nShe is paranoid and conservative, good-natured and austere, with a moral outlook bound by her deepest anxieties and obsessions. She is deeply spiritual and material, fascinated with objects and their history. She has many collections of many things she‚Äôs found. She‚Äôll likely die a Catholic, but has a confrontational relationship with God and no longer attends mass, as a declaration of humanism. She does not know if this has pissed Him off, but it‚Äôs working out so far. Maybe that‚Äôs why He made her a homosexual ‚Äî to get back at her. He must have a good sense of humour, if that‚Äôs the case.\nTzipora may be intense and inward-facing, but she can also be disarmingly charming and self-deprecating. She has a good sense of humour. There are not many girls that can so easily reconcile the contradictions between the peculiar and the healthy, the eccentric and the friendly, and the violent and the domestic. That‚Äôs part of her character ‚Äî an essence of being that radiates decency, good taste and a respect for the spirit of all things.\n Summer House in the Azores üìñ Published 28th July 2020 | Read here.\nThe Azores had been a possession of Vekllei since 2002, when they were leased from Portugal indefinitely. The lease was defunct by the time of Vekllei‚Äôs independence from U.K. occupation in 2015, and the new state took formal ownership over the small Atlantic islands.\nThe Azores was Vekllei‚Äôs resort region, often called simply the ‚Äúholiday isles‚Äù. Brief reprieves from the North Atlantic cold were granted to hundreds of thousands domestic tourists each year in resorts and holiday rentals alike. Tzipora spent the summer of 2079 there. Good memories were made in that summer. She did not much like the beach but she liked the ocean. If she could retire, it would be in the Azore\n Base Camp üìñ Published 21st July 2020 | Read here.\nJust a paint-sketch.\nThe puffin scouts set up camp not far from the rest, just outside of Krafla in the Lava region. When they moved south tomorrow, thick native grasses and trees would give way to flower-tundras and bare hills, and by Tuesday they‚Äôd be in the heart of Lava ‚Äî empty and extraterrestrial and volcanic.\nThe Krafla high-energy communications tower was visible from all over the region. It provided uninterrupted radio to most of North Lava, and could relay signals through satellites. In another country, it might have been considered a blight on a pristine view ‚Äî but in Vekllei, there was no such thing as pristine. It was as much a part of the landscape as the trees.\nThey started the fire first, figuring they‚Äôd have more enthusiasm for the tent when they were warm. Warm sunrays played on the field-grasses around them.\n Tzipora‚Äôs ‚ÄòEvery Day Carry‚Äô üìñ Published 20th July 2020 | Read here.\nLike a lot of girls of poverty, Tzipora was very possessive of her things. No food was ever left on her plate. There was a deep anxiety that whatever wasn‚Äôt claimed would be lost. She was also naturally obsessive and material-oriented, keenly aware of the importance of objects measured by metrics in her own silly head. You can discover a lot about a person from their trinkets and toys ‚Äî let‚Äôs discover a bit about Tzipora.\n  Her handbag is manufactured by Spaa S.p.A., a design firm in the capital. They‚Äôre a luxury item in the international market but readily available in Vekllei, since few other handbag makers operate on the scale of Spaa. Ayn picked it out shortly after Tzipora‚Äôs arrival for its colour, after Tzipora told her she did not own any red things.\n  Tzipora has a sweet tooth. Especially for soda, which she calls ‚Äúfizzy drink‚Äù. On her person at any time, she carries a flavoured beverage from one of several brands capable of meeting her discerning tastes. She supplements them with a water bottle, since not even fizzy drink refreshes as well as water after phys-ed or a hot day. She also stocks her arsenal of snacks with good fruit picked off trees that overhang footpaths, as well as devastating salvos of Vekllei‚Äôs finest confectionary, including Fruit Tingles and chocolate pearls. Other girls in her class bemoan her childish metabolism as she drinks soda for lunch while they watch the scales.\n  The nostalgic whimsy of the sweets is tempered by two or three loose cigarettes that float around in her purse at any given time. She‚Äôs not a regular smoker, but she‚Äôs prone to attacks related to stress, and nothing helps as much as a drag. She carries matches, for not much reason other than that‚Äôs what Baron uses, and Tzipora is notoriously sentimental.\n  Tzipora has a rock collection that sits on her bedroom sill, and her recent additions sit at the bottom of her purse. She‚Äôs not a rock elitist; quartz from footpaths catches her attention as easily as igneous treasures like palagonite. Her favourite is obsidian.\n  She carries a small collection of useful books, including a contemporary paperback and a notebook. The paperback is for recess and lunch; the notebook is for language notes and phone numbers. Her Vekllei I.D. papers, which are both a passport and a reference booklet of key information and services, are carried on her at all times. It‚Äôs not really necessary in day-to-day life ‚Äî but who knows when it might be, and Tzipora won‚Äôt be the one patting her pockets at the airport gate.\n  Finally, there are a few accessories sitting in the bag. Tzipora made a ring for Cobian in metalworking class, but Cobian is on a school trip to France at the moment and Tzipora is waiting for her return. She has a wristwatch given to her by Baron, which she wears sometimes depending on the occasion. Other items are more precautionary ‚Äî a scarf for the wind, a handkerchief for sneezing, and a spare pair of socks for when she visits Cobian‚Äôs house or if she needs to double up in cold weather. As summer turns to autumn, she also carries gloves and a beanie.\n  With everything in its place, her handbag is her anchor in the world outside her small second-floor apartment. The decommodification of society has only intensified the social value of objects, and they remain as important as ever in the life of the ordinary Vekllei person.\n The Race for Inefficiency: Vekllei‚Äôs advocation of austerity, apathy, and playfulness as economic principles üìñ Published 13th July 2020 | Read here.\nOverview of the Bureau System There are many thousands of companies busy with work in Vekllei. The vast majority of these companies are single-person shops (S.p.A., or senrouiva pettetie anaproiouya). Also common are wobbly shops, or co-operative businesses (S.q.A., or senrouiva qualitie anaproiouya). The largest of the non-bureau companies are village factories (S.p.M., or senrouiva persimonaya manufacturie).\nThe bureau-level world is full of company mastheads that emphasise modernity, dynamism and progress. Vekllei‚Äôs ‚Äúprivate businesses‚Äù, however, tend to be local in taste. The vast majority of S.p.A. and S.q.A. businesses bear the family names of their founders ‚Äî Desmesyo S.p.A., Risyiouisnesn Home Machines S.q.A., etc. Their legal denominations are almost always affixed to the end of their nameplates.\nTheir senrouiva designation marks them as non-bureau businesses. A bureau, as a reminder, is simply the top-level organisation of a trade union that organises business in the country. In practice, it means that a company is responsible to the political organs of the country. Although independent from the government, bureau business is inextricably entwined in government concern and runs parallel to it.\nSenrouvia businesses are also part of the bureau structure, but are in practice not managed directly by them. They are usually united in local concern by so-called petty bureaus; small cooperative organs that safeguard local interest and business. These petty bureaus are often at odds with the bureau organs proper, and so even though they are part of the same structure, they are fundamentally political opposed.\nSo what is sort of business goes on in a bureau proper?\nThere are two common categories of so-called ‚Äúbureau firms‚Äù. You have state industries (S.A., or societie indastrie), which deal with manufacturing and exploitation of resources that require direct management by a public organ. You‚Äôll already be familiar with several ‚Äî General Reactor S.A., Comen Aeroyards S.A., Farmer‚Äôs Syndicate S.A. to name a few.\nYou also have state requisites (A.r., or requoisesiasn amourisocietie), which refer to the vast government-operated organs made up six categories primarily.\n Utilities (A.r.Un.) Transport (A.r.R.) Education (A.r.E.) Local healthcare (A.r.F.) Construction (A.r.Lo.) Automation (A.r.M.)  Yes ‚Äî education is not organised as a government department, but a bureau business. Other state responsibilities are folded directly into government departments ‚Äî war, intelligence, healthcare, police, fire, and the mint are all managed directly by the government.\nArgument With the legal division of enterprise laid out, let us examine again the four precepts of the Vekllei economic ideology.\n Self-management and self-interest through Sundress Municipalism. Classification of property as an independent social organ, like nature. Abolishment of currency and currency-substitutes. Participatory employment. Economic feminisation.  These four principles reveal a great deal about the character of the country, and stand largely at face value. There is an interest in chasing the promises of modernity while deconstructing its metaphysical constructions, through the abolishment of exchange-value, property and the overhaul of gender-economics. There are anarchist gestures in each principle, yet it is obvious that the product of these values complexify the conventional anarchist imagination. This is part of a series of contradictions ‚Äî between free and planned markets, between internationalism and provinciality, between man and woman, between freedom and security.\nAusterity The bureau system is plagued by inefficiencies, arising from logistic systems premised on warehousing, poor Coasean bargaining between petty bureaus and proper bureaus, a political emphasis on macroeconomic outcomes, a decoupling of aggregate demand and national economic output, cultural intolerance for Pareto inefficiencies, etc.\nLuxury goods often vary in both supply and access, and economies are often severely localised to the point of provincialism, meaning that Vekllei has failed to transition reliably to a modern consumer society. The inhabitants of the Montre borough most often eat seafood because speciality meats, especially authentic red meat, are scarce. The opposite is true in Yana. Clothes are repaired and regifted, appliances are available only from regional outlets usually located in the same city as the factory, and culture and diet are fiercely regional.\nThis is, in part, a result of unflinching national austerity and the sublimation of artificial markets prompted by Vekllei‚Äôs gold-based auxiliary currency, which necessitates meeting debt obligations for its strength internationally. There is a belief in Vekllei that the wealth of the country allowed the abolition of the currency ‚Äî in fact, the opposite is true. The abolition of currency allows a permanent wealth that compensates for the inefficiencies of the bureau system. The bureau firms do not pay their workers ‚Äî on paper, there are no expenses for anything beyond raw commodity exchange. This is how Vekllei‚Äôs largest companies ‚Äî and, per the bureau system, its government ‚Äî remain solvent.\nAusterity is a cultural force, too ‚Äî the scarcity of luxury goods inflates their social value, where comforts and necessities are largely abundant in automation. It creates an unimportant hardship that keeps Vekllei people forward-facing, lean, and ambitious. To acquire Picco S.p.A.‚Äôs iconic lounge chairs, you have to travel to their outlet in Horn, hundreds of kilometres from the capital area. There is no motivation for a craftsman to meet demand ‚Äî there is no petty consumption, either. To own a Picco chair means you have understood its cultural value, utility and craftsmanship, and have made the effort to find and transport one to your home. Inconvenience, and by extension, austerity, is celebrated as a ‚Äútrial of ownership.‚Äù Objects are very important in Vekllei, and craftsmanship is highly valued, and so people like to surround themselves with hand-made, sublime things wrought not just by the labour of the artisan, but their own effort to acquire it.\nPetty austerity instills a national sentiment that tells the ordinary Vekllei person they are hardier than the ordinary American or European, even if the wealth of the ordinary Vekllei person is much greater than that of the ordinary American or European.\nApathy Despite a vast, loosely organised private market in the senrouiva categorisation, Vekllei does not reward entrepreneurial ambition. Ambitious people are funnelled into positions of power in bureau firms and political office, but the founding of S.p.As and S.q.As is rarely motivated by a desire for influence or power. Indeed, artisanal S.p.As are often incapable of the sort of economies of scale needed for expansion. Vekllei instead relies on a sort of economic apathy, in which aggregate demand and productivity are spurned for immediate interest and pleasure.\nThis ensures that\n luxury products remain creative, personal works per Upen‚Äôs insistence on the symbiosis of labour and product the private senrouiva market is not capable of threatening the provincialism of Sundress Municipalism, which might make a commodity universally accessible and threaten to introduce generic consumer society into Vekllei life the private senrouiva market under petty bureau organisation does not threaten the organised de facto monopolies of the bureau companies  If Vekllei has replaced the commodity with the object, then it is through economic apathy that they have ensured objects will never again become commodities. Just as the ordinary Vekllei person is apolitical, so too are they apathetic towards change in their purchasing habits, favouring small, inconvenient and personal brands over those exploiting aggregate demand. In a sense, this also contributed to the popular Vekllei term product atheism, in which the metaphysics of products are dismantled and rearranged into social forms.\nIn this sense, the apathy is found on both ends ‚Äî within the senrouiva business owner, who is provided little upward mobility to satisfy ambition beyond local and regional expansion, and within the consumer, who recognises products only within cultural and social dimensions. Neither is conducive to a functioning, fair market on an interregional scale.\nPlay Play is the foundational motivation of most work in Vekllei. There are existential motivators, too ‚Äî a desire to wield power, or professional legacy ‚Äî but in many professions it is play by which a Vekllei person justifies labour. It is also why work is fiercely protected by petty bureaus and other labour organisations ‚Äî work is their connection to wider society, and that connection is held sacred in Upen.\nIt is through work as play that Vekllei is able to justify the employment of children. Financial motivations for work have all but disappeared ‚Äî in its place, the workplace has to convince people to work. There are few state protections for businesses unable to maintain a workforce, either ‚Äî it is one of the most common reasons for the shuttering of a company. The boss must convince his workers to stay, and so a total inversion of power has occurred.\nIn place of money, there is prestige, and in prestige there is myth. Few people have genuine interest in Fordism. Many more are attracted to the hand-crafted furniture of Picco S.p.A., and becoming recognised as a builder of great things. In a sense, a person ‚Äúacts out‚Äù the role of a craftsman, in the same way a person ‚Äúacts out‚Äù the role of a police officer, or ‚Äúacts out‚Äù life as a pilot.\nIn this system, the childish spirit of recreation, duty and ‚Äúthe adult world‚Äù is acted out by millions of Vekllei people each day. Seeds planted by a child play-acting as a farmer continue to grow, and so too does the Vekllei economy feed its population through the intersection of fantasy and labour. At this point it is obvious that play is not fantasy at all, but in fact a motivation for labour as genuine as profit. Where it falls short, in hard, disempowering jobs, it is automated and conscripted through the mandatory service system. As it is often described:\n‚ÄúThe Bureau System is labour-intensive where wanted, alleviated by industrial machinery where preferred, and automated where necessary.‚Äù\nIn its wake are states of play, and through play comes a decent framework for living, obvious in the basic satisfaction of the Vekllei people.\n Police in Vekllei üìñ Published 8th July 2020 | Read here.\nThere are two regular police organs in Vekllei.\n Fedecenoayan porits (national police, or venopor) Comoisniyan denporitsa (local police, or cosmopor)  A young venopor officer stands on the left, in the full street regalia they‚Äôre renowned for. Unlike cosmopor they often carry machine guns while on patrol and are stationed outside of government buildings, hospitals, train stations, ports, schools and any company managed directly by a bureau, which is a trade organ of national importance. They are special units of special purpose, and supplement the deficiencies of local policing through their training and tactical deployment.\nThey are police insofar as they protect and respond to their community, including through special tactics situations, but are paramilitary in their wider function as a defence force for critical infrastructure. This is reflected in their history, traced cleanly back past independence and the Atomic War to the royal guards and junta federal police of old society, which continue to be reflected in their uniforms and several other ceremonial artefacts, like swords and knee boots. Venopor is a complex organisation with many different purposes. There are street patrols, pictured here, but there are also intelligence units associated with HO/NI and by extension the military, as well as tactical response teams, bomb squads, search and rescue and most other specialised emergency units outside of the capabilities of any given local police station.\nThis is contrast to the cosmopor, a more conventional police outfit. A cosmopor officer stands on the right, in standard summer uniform. He carries a radio, revolver and rubber baton for the worst of his duties, and is embedded deep into his local community. Cosmopor officers traditionally visit and introduce themselves to each house in their beat, and spend far more of their time mediating, counselling and organising than they do making arrests. The autonomy of most Vekllei communities largely spurns petty legal proceedings, and so the cosmopor are a critical aspect of sundress municipalism, resolving disputes personally and taking custody of a person only when it‚Äôs needed. Most crime in Vekllei tends to be emotionally motivated ‚Äî so it is in this domain that cosmopor navigate.\nThis makes the cosmopor especially powerful figures in a Vekllei village or township, but their duties are closely watched. While the Vekllei village may be autonomous, all officers in Vekllei are responsible to a division of venopor called ‚Äúofficer welfare,‚Äù or picosec, which operates autonomously to seek out incompetent or misbehaving police officers, no matter their jurisdiction or status. Where most business in Vekllei has very little in the way of professional behaviour or ‚Äúwork culture‚Äù, policing in Vekllei is held to high standards, and they are severely bound by traditions that have become codified as the country has grown. This is a time and place where the children of police often inherit the jobs of their parents, and the constables of a village often have roots that go back centuries. This often makes cosmopor very respected figures, and their successors and recruits are expected to work for that respect.\nIn a country that has done away with money as a measure of success, professional legacy is profoundly important in Vekllei. In this inversion of priority, teachers, doctors, pilots, constables and librarians are celebrated. This is not founded in a general egalitarianism, but in fact the precise opposite ‚Äî a celebration of success and influence, touching the lives of those around them. The glamour, and paycheque, has largely been stripped away. Only the work remains, and so that work has become more important than ever.\n VI. The Post Office Why you should love your computer: Independence and control through free software [NEW] BY MTIRADO#2460\nDo you feel proud when you turn on your computer? Do you feel satisfied with your favourite software\u0026rsquo;s user experience? Nowadays technology, specially I.T., is getting more and more intertwined with our daily lives. Each year we rely more and more on it and at the same time, layers upon layers of abstraction are being placed to simplify its usage and impede our understanding of its inner workings. Social media, web services, software and devices that we use daily offer us an intuitive and simple experience at the cost of giving up any sort of control or fine-tuning. Take a look at computers for example ‚Äî your average desktop or laptop. For many people, their computer is just another tool; a complicated, scary, cumbersome tool. Plagued with viruses, weird pop-ups, and painful slowness. If you dare to turn on your slow, noisy computer, it\u0026rsquo;s because you had to print some documents or fill out an online form. So you just open MS Office Word, and/or Google Chrome, and forget everything else, because clicking on any other icon will render your computer useless. Even if it\u0026rsquo;s fast and sleek, computers are still a mystery. Then, outside of our comfort zone, there lies the stuff of tech specialists, hackers, and hobbyists. Even if you\u0026rsquo;re a tech enthusiast that keeps up with the latest gadgets and updates, your user experience is still dependent on the decisions of a single organisation or company that does not usually tolerate decentralisation. We do not have enough control over the products we own.\nWere computers always meant to be used like this? Like a black box that\u0026rsquo;s hard to open and understand ‚Äî hard to make it ours? Mainstream operating systems and software give us the promise of an experience that just works ‚Äî if we go all in on their ecosystems. Their software and utilities are easy to use and intuitive, but hard to understand and control. If you want to customize how your favorite program renders a different type of file, good luck with that. If you want to do something that\u0026rsquo;s slightly outside the program\u0026rsquo;s intended purpose, no one can help you. Future updates are controlled by a small, concentrated group. You can never know what goes on under the hood if you can\u0026rsquo;t open the hood. You can never know how something works if there\u0026rsquo;s no need to read the manual. These days, privacy concerns are greater than ever, and smartphones are getting harder and harder to tamper with, using proprietary software and assembly techniques that make repair difficult. We learn to accept and embrace the software that comes bundled with our computer and we shudder when we realise we need to fix a problem ourselves.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the alternative?, How are we supposed to strengthen the relationship between the user and the tool when we are told to accept that computers are hard to understand and control, and that abstraction is necessary? This is where free (‚Äòfree' as in ‚Äòfreedom'), open source software becomes relevant. Open source software gives the user privacy, flexibility, control, and choice. A wide variety of open source software caters to the nerdiest of power users and the casual users that only needs to browse the web and print some documents alike. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if you don\u0026rsquo;t know how to read the code. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to learn a programming language to be able to regain independence and control of your computer. Free software like Linux has come a long way, and is now more user friendly than ever. You shouldn‚Äôt have to choose between ease-of-use and open source software ‚Äî and with Linux, it‚Äôs no longer a trade-off. Installing a new OS, tinkering with your machine, following tutorials to customise the UI, and making a website not only gives you have a deeper understanding of how your computer and technology works, it helps change your perception of computing and your relationship with technology in general. Using software that encourages you to modify and customise gives you control and independence that no proprietary software can.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t promise you that you won‚Äôt face problems using open source software, because that\u0026rsquo;s simply not true. Sometimes we can\u0026rsquo;t leave proprietary software altogether. No software is perfect, just as no tool is perfect. But at least free software gives you the opportunity to make a better tool, if you\u0026rsquo;re willing to sharpen it, willing to read through the documentation, willing to work and get your hands dirty with configuration files to solve a problem, and of course, willing to fail. The reward goes beyond having your computer work just as you want it: you end up with a tool, a product that is truly yours ‚Äî something you can feel proud of, tangible and meaningful.\nDoes that mean that we should struggle every time we use our computer? Absolutely not. But we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t always strive to make technology easy to use, but instead try and make it easy to understand. Because if you\u0026rsquo;re able to make sense of things and truly know what\u0026rsquo;s going on, ease of use will come naturally.\nP.S. If you\u0026rsquo;re thinking about switching to Linux, my personal recommendation is Linux Mint. I recently installed it on a laptop and automatically detected Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and all network printers. No driver download required. It\u0026rsquo;s ready to use out of the box and highly customisable. And remember, you can keep Linux and your current operating system in the same computer if you want.\n VII.

Overview Vekllei is the utopian landscape of Hobart\u0026rsquo;s ongoing Petticoat Project. Set ostensibly in Iceland, the history and geography of this country is radically different from our own, and welcomes an open exploration of new systems of living through a flexible alternate history.  V ekllei (also The Vekllei Commonwealth, Islandi, Iceland) is a sovereign island country situated in the northern Atlantic, between Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Besides the 100 boroughs of the conterminous Vekllei city-state (referred to as the Home Island or Crown Metropole), Vekllei includes two autonomous territories, six crown territories and various possessions including over a hundred satellite islands and islets. It is the 14th most densely-populated country in the world, with a population of 24.4 millions mostly situated around the Capital Region in the south-west of the Home Island. Its capital and largest city is Vekllei in the Capital Region, which is home to two-thirds of the total population. The interior plateau of the Home Island consists of sand and lava fields, flower-tundras, glaciers, and temperate rainforests, and its lowlands are home to many glacial rivers.\nThe Home Island has been inhabited for at least four thousand years by Arctic peoples migrating from Kalalist (Greenland). Evidence of European settlement in Vekllei can be determined from unearthed fishing towns dated to 1230BC, when settlers from Ireland established fishing communities along the southern coast. Subsequent centuries saw rapid growth of the local population, which was politically and culturally isolated from mainland Europe by the 6th Century BC. By the 4th Century BC, many contemporary cultural features of the country had become commonplace, including an early form of Upen and Vekllei logographs. During the following millennia Vekllei developed into a major economic and military power, but saw its influence decline between the 12th and 15th Centuries AD during the Period of Rest.\nDuring Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Middle Period, the country was struck by civil unrest that escalated into civil war, which installed the Aismo Desimou as the first King of Vekllei. The monarchy succeeded until Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s colonial Late Period, which fell to a navy coup d\u0026rsquo;etat that installed a military junta in government, which rapidly expanded Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s colonial holdings. This practice would continue well into the 20th Century, and would spark the Africa Wars and Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s atomic bombing by the United Kingdom in 2005, which collapsed the existing regime and ushered in British occupation of the country.\nSince independence in 2015, Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Floral Period has transformed the country, and has been marked by a period of tremendous stability and economic growth. Vekllei does not use money domestically, with most internal trade dependent on social exchange, barter and state service, but operates twin currencies (the Government and Vekllei Crown) in its trade internationally. Vekllei is a great power and has the world\u0026rsquo;s fifth highest military expenditure. The country is highly developed and has exceptional liveability, and is placed highly in key social indicators: education, healthcare, quality of life, personal safety and housing, with a home-ownership rate of nearly 96%. It is a member of the United Nations' Non-Aligned Concern League. Since independence, Vekllei has maintained a strong position of armed neutrality, and is home to many international organisations, including the new United Nations Office, the International Federation of Journalists and the Universal Post Union. Immigrants account for 30% of the population, and multiracialism is enshrined in the constitution, and continues to shape national policies in education, housing, and politics. Vekllei has large foreign-born populations from Eastern and Southern Europe, North Africa, the British Isles, Hong Kong, and Latin America.\nIntroduction Vekllei, officially the Vekllei Commonwealth, is a society blossoming with contradictions and anachronisms, which reflect and fold into each other to produce new forms of living. The country advocates laissez-faire market participation and soviet-style central planning simultaneously; it is the site of a healthy new democracy utterly divorced by public apathy, and a place of midcentury science-worship and automation used to bolster backwardness and agrarian living. This idea carries on and on, cascading throughout all levels of society. This is a nation bound constitutionally to secularism and religious freedoms, described in a document only legible through indigenous spiritualism. This is a culture intent on abolishing commodity-forms through the worship of products. To foreigners, Vekllei is a wonderland of contradictions that in conventional imagination would collapse in on each other, yet Vekllei has flourished in postwar independence, quickly rising up amongst the most developed and livable countries in the world.\nSuch a country deserves observation, then. This document and its subarticles are dedicated to the country of Vekllei and the facts of its utopian dimensions, and hope to illustrate a definitive and contemporary understanding of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Epoch of Rest (what they call their \u0026lsquo;floral period\u0026rsquo;). This is an illustration of how the beating systems in Vekllei look, the abstract data laid bare. Vekllei has an absurd multidimensionality about it, since it is a country in which all things are singularly perfect in their purity and good-heartedness while applying this qualifier to multiple ideas at the same time. In some ways, Vekllei thrives because of rather than in spite of these contradictions. This document is a good place to start.\n2. Etymology T he word Vekllei comes from the Islandi-Quutetast fusion dialect called Topyas (\u0026lsquo;Old Vekllei\u0026rsquo; in English), which was in common use by the 1st Century AD. It comes from the Topyas words for \u0026ldquo;volcanic town,\u0026rdquo; or Vek, and \u0026ldquo;sea under the stars,\u0026rdquo; or Lei, meaning \u0026ldquo;town of the stars by the sea\u0026rdquo;. According to sagas, the name was gifted to the country by a volcanic spirit-god called Tipet (most likely present-day Kesmi) in the 3rd Century, but was likely a feature of Queen Souisviasn\u0026rsquo;s language reforms during that time.\nThe word \u0026ldquo;Vekllei\u0026rdquo; refers to both the country and the island, and is also pluralised.\nVekllei was first known as Islandi, or \u0026ldquo;Land of Ice\u0026rdquo; in an extinct Indo-European language documented under the same name in early sagas, but is likely at least partially derived from Algic-Aleutian Quutetast word for \u0026ldquo;snow,\u0026rdquo; Ismo. Sagas award Faroese settler Ann Sigf√∫sdottir with the island\u0026rsquo;s discovery and name, though little else is known of her.\nThe name Vekllei ostensibly applies foremost to the physical landscape of the country, of which the present city-state inherits its name. In addition, the people of Vekllei, language, and all subsequent pluralisations are also Vekllei.\n3. Geography Vekllei is an ancient country of striking geological monument. A landscape of igneous rock and lava flows, Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s dramatic geology is tempered by its healthy abundance of rainforests and flower-tundras, which paint the country in soft mossy hues of green and yellow.  V ekllei sits atop the constructive boundary of the Mid-Atlantic ridge, bridging the North American and the Eurasian tectonic plates. The country is also found between the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans, although the entirety of the Home Island is situated beneath the arctic circle. Despite this, the extreme latitude of inhabited areas means daylight is highly seasonal in the country, with dark winters and summer solstices that provide 23 consecutive hours of daylight. This dramatic seasonal environment has ongoing political, economic and cultural relevance in the country today, and contributes to the dependence on hothouses and greenhouses for agriculture throughout the year.    The unstable Atlantic pressure oscillation, of which Vekllei anchors as the Vekllei Low Pole, can pull in bitter cold from the Greenland currents, or warmth from the Azores tempestuously. This gifts the Home Islands a temperate, though subarctic climate, with average temperatures in summer of about 18-25 degrees centigrade that decline into an annual mean low of approximately 10 degrees in the Capital Region. The good weather and seasonal daylight inform Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s animistic spiritualism, with festivals to mark both solstices.\nVekllei sits between North American and Continental European territories, but is usually regarded as independent of both because of its central position in the North Atlantic and its peripheral possessions, which include Kala (Greenland) and the Aismious Islands (Faroe Islands). Because of its volcanic origins and position above the Earth\u0026rsquo;s Great Kiss (the Mantle Plume), Vekllei remains highly volcanic and several volcanoes remain active in the country. The world\u0026rsquo;s newest island, Liyra, was formed in 2056 off Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s South Coast.\nVekllei is the world\u0026rsquo;s 18th largest island, and has significant biological and climate diversity for a landmass of its size. Southern Vekllei is wet, seasonal and temperate, populated mostly by temperate rainforests and spruce forests. Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s glacial interior is dominated by flower-tundras, called Ro, and barren vegetation consisting mostly of grasslands, plains, and isolated woodland. Lava fields, mountains and massive freshwater glaciers are also common throughout the middle and east of the country. Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s north is dry and subarctic, and receives heavy snowfall and ice in winter months. The entire Home Islands are marked by dramatic volcanic landscapes of steep igneous rock, valleys and glacial monuments. Vekllei has some of the tallest waterfalls in the world. The country has the highest number of flowers per capita in the world.\n4. Politics Politics in Vekllei are characterised by postwar constitutional values of nonpartisan democracy and transparency of power. Vekllei people are, as evidenced by voter turnouts, often apolitical in nature. This is because political concern in Vekllei is aestheticised and treated similarly to petty commodity; as a feature of life, but fundamentally participatory. In truth, at least with regards to domestic concern, Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s daily affairs are basically autonomous, and politics remains the concern of an educated, invested class of people.  V ekllei is a unitary city-state and nonpartisan parliamentary democracy, divided into crown lakes, boroughs and provincial administrative divisions. It retains the territory of Vekllei as a sovereign of the country, in keeping with Upen, but otherwise the prime ministers have equal executive power, with disputes mediated by the Crown Senate. Vekllei retains a parliamentary system as a legacy of British occupation, but has since developed several indigenous features including its land-sovereign and twin ministership. The Vekllei system also incorporates American political features, including a constitution and bicameral house system.\nVekllei\u0026rsquo;s government is portioned between three branches:\n The Legislature, represented by Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s bicameral parliament and the landscape sovereign. The Executive, represented by the prime ministers and the elected ministerial cabinet. The Judiciary, represented by the High Court and Constitutional Court of Vekllei, whose judges are appointed by the lower house and cabinet.  Vekllei uses a Hare-Clark single transferable vote system to elect two prime ministers, one man and one woman, the only such system in the world. Vekllei has a bicameral legislature, consisting of an upper house (the Crown Senate) of 100 senators and a lower house (People\u0026rsquo;s Assembly) of 200 members. Although voting is participatory and the country does not maintain a poll tax, electoral enrolment is mandatory from age 16 onwards.\nSince Vekllei is nonpartisan, it does not allow formal participation of parties within elections. Despite this, informal associations of elected representatives exist, in the form of sociopartit, or Party Associations. The largest of these include the Vekllei Industrial Working Concern, the Atlantic Party, and the Crown Brotherhood, and although membership is permitted among elected members they are otherwise disallowed within the electoral process.\nAdministrative divisions ‚ùñ See also: Boroughs of Vekllei  Although Vekllei is unitary politically and considers itself a city-state, the Home Islands are divided geographically between 100 boroughs (as part of the borough system). Each borough is proportional to the land-sovereign\u0026rsquo;s natural wealth, which accounts for its history, folklore and natural features. Because of this, the human population of boroughs is highly disproportionate, the smallest being Bakur, in the Afouismeh region, with a population of 7,500 people, and the largest being Vekllei proper, in the Capital Region, of 2.4 millions.\nEach borough elects a Senator and two House Members. Overseas Crown Lakes territories vote in ministerial elections but do not vote for legislative members, and semiautonomous territories maintain their own parliaments.\n Crown Lakes, or Kronaislagaisdelfia, are governmental territories of human concern, analogous to public land or federal territory overseas. Crown Land, or Kronaismioudelfia, are nongovernmental territories of natural reservation. Although similar in some ways to nature reserves or national parks, their legal status in Vekllei is somewhat more complex; although de facto part of the country, the government does not recognise human sovereignty over these regions, a feature inherited from Upen. Boroughs, or Baras, are administrative regions in Vekllei named for their largest population centres. They form the basic subdivision of Vekllei territory and also constitute voting regions in the electoral system. Provinces, or Piousvincinia, are the territories in Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s possession outside of the Home Islands. Most notably these include Kala (Greenland), the Aismious Islands (Faroe Islands), the Kalina Isles and the Azores. As inhabited provinces, both Kala and the Azores are considered semiautonomous territories, under purview of the Kala People\u0026rsquo;s Assembly and the Azores Holiday Government respectively. The Aismious province and various other territories are considered Crown Lakes. Vekllei also retains over a hundred satellite islands and islets, most as Crown Lands.  In total, Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s various possessions and administrative systems can be argued for as a form of federalism, though in practice more closely resembles a canton system or disparate republic.\nFloral Society Floral Society is the informal Vekllei phrase for the postwar Vekllei state, distinguishing it from the prewar junta and monarchy. The new period is characterised by democratisation and widespread personal freedoms, but has also recalled traditional cultural history into contemporary Vekllei life. Since the war, Vekllei has been marked by rapid change, and Floral Society\u0026rsquo;s growing cultural legacy, which continues to distance it from the prewar period.\nPetticoat constitution The Petticoat Constitution (officially the Constitution of Vekllei) is Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s founding constitutional document since independence, and remains a core political and cultural factor in the country. It provides for \u0026ldquo;Atlantic-style democracy,\u0026rdquo; free association and press, and a nonpartisan judicial system among other things.\nThe Constitution is underlined by four principles of postwar Vekllei life, outlined as follows:\n Self-management and self-interest through Sundress Municipalism. Classification of property as an independent social organ of the landscape-sovereign. Abolishment of currency and currency-substitutes. Economic feminisation.  These features manifest in various forms throughout modern Vekllei, including its moneylessness, place-metaphysics, and personal freedoms. Its association with the Rebirth of Vekllei, characterised as female in Upen, gave the document its colloquial name Petticoat Constitution, after its provisions for women in democratic Vekllei society.\n Sundress Municipalism Sundress Municipalism is the way in which Vekllei settlements are organised within boroughs, and informs the way in which cities are built. Vekllei has an indigenous architecture ideology, called Newda, which conforms to planning and lifestyle principles laid out in Sundress Municipalism. The principles themselves are often represented as a seven-pointed star, with each point marking a principle. They are as follows:\n Local employment, or \u0026ldquo;commutelessness.\u0026rdquo; Slumlessness, beautification, and a will to architecture. Property stewardship. Open air and clean water. Land usefulness (\u0026quot;friendliness\u0026quot;). Private ownership of private needs. Public ownership of public needs.  Sundress Municipalism folds into broader conceptual ideas indigenous to Vekllei about space and ownership, found throughout its political system (as in the landscape sovereign) and its economy (as in product atheism). To this end, most ongoing construction and civic planning in the country invoke Sundress Municipalism as a framework.\n  5. Economy Vekllei is land of plenty and small pleasures, afforded by a post-scarcity system that positions competing systems against each other. It is made up of a startling series of contradictions \u0026ndash; one after the other, each more unusual than the last. Vekllei is a planned economy; it is also a free market. Property ownership is obfuscated by portioned sovereignty of land and product. Decommodification has devalued products in a country based on manufacturing. There are many contradictions, inefficiencies and unusual mechanisms in the Vekllei domestic market, which total to benefit the living conditions of the average person.  A lthough a major power, Vekllei has an unusual hybrid market system called the Vekllei Bureau System (known colloquially as Petticoat Socialism), which incorporates state-owned socialist planned economics and deregulated syndicalist vertical bureaus to benefit a free, unregulated informal market system. Most unique about the Vekllei economy is its functional moneylessness, in which domestic society has abolished currency. No widespread currency substitutes are used in ordinary life. Each citizen owns a share of the Labour Bank of Vekllei, a portion of the Government Securities Bureau designed to allow emigration from the country, and so is theoretically entitled to an equal portion of the Bank.    Trade and materials are provided by biosynthetic robotics infrastructure and participatory work, and is supplemented in places by mandatory military service. Vekllei people enjoy a high standard of living and access to most consumer goods.\nPostwar Vekllei economics champions free association, home-ownership and informal markets. Although microeconomically Vekllei is highly liberalised, most essential goods of the country are produced in vertically integrated in labour-union Bureaus, which, although representative of private companies and independent from the government, are associated with the general political processes of the country.\nBureaus (also Bureaus Proper, as distinguished from informal Petty Bureaus) are trade unions that organise business in the country, and the largest of them include thousands of individual companies and concerns. Companies are generally cooperative enterprises in Vekllei, and so worker votes are consolidated into \u0026ldquo;Company Ballots\u0026rdquo; used to influence political affairs within a Bureau and the country at large.\nAlthough moneyless domestically, the nation maintains two currencies, known as the Vekllei Crown and the Government Crown for foreign trade.\n The Vekllei Crown is representative of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s export-import mechanism known as the International Market. It is gold-backed, and represents the bullion value of the Market. Since the International Market is completely closed and independent of the domestic economy, its value is controlled directly by the so-called Government Bank. It is one of the few gold-backed currencies in a developed nation today. The Government Crown is not minted and used only as an investment mechanism, backed by government ‚Äúwhite bonds‚Äù which are usually measures of labour-hours or refined materials. It is, in a sense, a fiat currency alongside a gold-backed currency.  Both currencies are used for trade internationally, and float on the labour-power of the domestic economy. The Vekllei Crown is minted as a novelty, but otherwise no money is printed in the country, since Government Crowns are essentially labour-backed state bonds. Moneylessness benefits citizens in many ways, as Vekllei people do not typically maintain debts, have access to unlimited small commodities, and enjoy some of the shortest workdays and working weeks in the world, with all citizens afforded two months holiday each year.\nEmployment Vekllei has a high unemployment rate for a developed country, reported at 12.5%. About 80% of Vekllei workers belong to a trade union, usually Pettiburos or Bureaus. Nearly 2 million Vekllei people are enrolled in higher education full-time, significantly reducing the nation\u0026rsquo;s labour pool. These are accounted for politically as natural fluctuations of the deregulated Bureau System, and unemployment in the country has seen a stable reduction since the initial decades of independence. Although many citizens in Vekllei are immigrants, the country has few foreign workers, and those employed in the country tend to be high-skill and high-wage workers.\nSince no work is compensated by money in the country, international standard metrics for poverty and income per capita are obfuscated. It is generally understood that urban populations have easier access to consumer goods, but inferior access to local produce and genuine meat products. Rural populations are also more likely to take on informal work in their village or town, and may not necessarily hold membership in an industry bureau.\nIndustry All commercial enterprise in Vekllei is founded along two legal and cultural classifications:\n Venrouive is business managed by a Bureau Proper, an organ consisting of trade unions in an industry. While Bureaus are independent from government, they are for the most part bound to their concern, and so in practice Venrouive businesses are beholden to the democratic processes of the country. Senrouive is business not managed by a Bureau Proper, though it may still hold membership in a Petty Bureau. It is analogous to private enterprise.  Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s sovereign wealth fund, the Government Securities Bureau, is the largest such fund in the world with commodity and non-commodity holdings totalling over VK‚ù¶45 trillion. It is the primary investment mechanism of the Vekllei state and has generated controversy around its substantial economic power and commodity holdings abroad. Vekllei is the second-largest logistics hub in the world, and as a maritime city-state sees millions of tonnes worth of shipping traffic each year pass through its ports.\nVekllei\u0026rsquo;s Dohyo Free Port is the largest in the Atlantic and among the busiest in the world. Most of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s liquid currency assets, denominated as Government Kroner, are generated through a shipping Goods and Services Tax (GST) on all foreign business in the country of approx. 10%, of which the Dohyo Free Port contributes VK‚ù¶12 trillion each year.\nVekllei primarily exports manufactured goods, which are produced by both human and automatic labour via commodity imports and extraterrestrial materials mining as part of the Solar Concern of the Vekllei Commonwealth Materials Bureau (or Solaburo).\nMost personal or private business in Vekllei is structured as either single-person shops (S.p.A., or senrouiva pettetie anaproiouya), co-operative businesses (S.q.A., or senrouiva qualitie anaproiouya), or village factories (S.p.M., or senrouiva persimonaya manufacturie). Any commercial enterprise larger than S.p.M. tends to hold membership in or is directly administered by a Bureau Proper, though there are exceptions.\nTourism Tourism is a major source of foreign income in Vekllei, and the country attracts some 6 million tourists annually. Although the number of tourists is low compared to popular destinations in North America and Europe, Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s strict entry requirements and state monopoly on hotels and tourist infrastructure means that most visitors are high-wealth business travellers or affluent foreigners, which together contribute around 0.5% of the country\u0026rsquo;s GDP annually.\nVekllei sponsors tourism abroad via the Social Government Bank, which allows Vekllei people to withdraw superannuated cash savings for tourism and travel abroad.\n6. Demographics The story of Vekllei is a story of rebirth, and no better is this exemplified than in the country\u0026rsquo;s cultural Aliyah after the Atomic War. Vekllei is an ancient country rediscovering itself and its people, and in the rapid development of the postwar Floral Period we find novel and exciting shifts in how Vekllei people talk, behave, and look.  V ekllei has one of the highest population densities in the world, skewed largely by the populous Capital Region. Vekllei considers itself a city-state, and to this end fosters \u0026ldquo;commonhoods\u0026rdquo;, represented by common practice, common work and common landscape. Although Vekllei has been settled for thousands of years, postwar advocation of commonhoods emphasises landscape in place of the historic blood in wake of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s growing migrant population and multiculturalism. Nearly 30% of Vekllei people were born overseas, though this number is trending down as immigration quotas (set by emigration) restrict inflow in recent decades.\nVekllei is experiencing a slight demographic trend towards an older population, and the average age of the country stands at 35 years old.\nVekllei maintains a stable fertility rate of about 1.8 children per woman, indicating a slight decline in population. Vekllei enjoys high rates of immigration, sponsored by the government, and sees settlement from Western and Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, South-East Asia and South America. Vekllei has also experienced high rates of emigration since independence, although many expats retain citizenship and later return to residence in Vekllei at some point. To this end, Vekllei is one of the largest exporters of skilled workers and tradesmen in the world.\nLanguage ‚ùñ Main article: Language in Vekllei  Modern Vekllei language (referred to simply as Vekllei) is the national language of the country and spoken universally within the Home Islands and Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s various Atlantic possessions. It is notable for its varied sublanguages, which include a signed language called Upotenne and various extant utility scripts.\nVekllei is spoken by around 25 million people, and a further 800,000 people around the world. Its relative complexity and provinciality lend to Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s cultural obscurity abroad, since few Vekllei people are English literate.\nReligion ‚ùñ Main article: Religion in Vekllei  Upen is the nondenominational animism of Vekllei, and is practiced nearly universally throughout the country in various forms and traditions. As much a secular cultural tradition as an organised religion, Upen coexists alongside abrahamic and miscellaneous faiths in the country, integrating most immigrant populations in Vekllei into its scripture on landscape and sumoismiaya, or the \u0026ldquo;spirit of things.\u0026rdquo;\nWhile Vekllei has no state religion, Upen is thoroughly integrated with Vekllei culture and policy, and informs life and practice in this country as an agonistic feature of culture. Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Floral Constitution prohibits governmental regulation of religion or prohibition of faith. Despite this, Upen is taught in state schools and practiced frequently, reinforcing its relevance across younger generations in a broader resurgence of traditional folklore in the postwar era.\nAlthough most people in the country observe Upen apolitically, several other religious cultures hold sway in the country, including Catholicism (11%) Judaism (9%), Buddhism (4%), Islam (2%), Hinduism (1.3%) and Sikhism (0.7%). Despite this, Vekllei has some of the lowest rates of religious adherence in the world, estimated at a mere 6%, signifying Upen\u0026rsquo;s cultural influence on personal practice and informal ritual.\nEducation Education in Vekllei is structured as a State Requisite Bureau (rather than department) under the requoisesiasn amourisocietie scolastie, or A.r.E. Schooling is mandatory and universal between the ages of 5 and 14, and most schools in the country serve all ages between these years. All schools in Vekllei, aside from a half-dozen religious schools, are coeducational and operated directly by the A.r.E.\nAll institutions of higher learning, including universities, trade schools and adult education, are structured under the A.r.E.. School uniforms informed by traditional dress are provided and worn from preschool through to university, and faculty staff also often wear them.\n   Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s school enrolment is among the highest in the world, though this calculation includes untraditional and labour schools, including agricultural and maritime schooling.\n7. Infrastructure If Vekllei is hesitant towards formal recognition of socialist aspects within its economy, in its infrastructure those concerns are discarded entirely. Vekllei is a midcentury state of nationalised infrastructure, led by grand modernist visions of progress and affluence. When combined with Upen\u0026rsquo;s spiritual emphasis on physicality and permanence, Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s affection for monuments of utility and public works are shown to be deeply embedded in the Vekllei national political spirit.  U nlike manufacturing and general industry, public infrastructure in the country is almost entirely monopolised by the government Utilities (A.r.Un.) and Construction (A.r.Lo.) state requisites, organs in Vekllei analogous to nationalised government industry. Infrastructure consistently ranks among Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s greatest national expenditure, with trillions of Kroner each year poured into projects across the country.\nMost large infrastructure projects, including transport, education, health, military and extraterrestrial interests, are completed in cyclical phases similar to Soviet half-decade plans, including production quotas and hard deadlines for completion. This system of construction has allowed the country to recover quickly from its devastation in the Atomic War and develop one of the most comprehensive public infrastructure systems in the world. Vekllei is a major transport hub for international flights and Atlantic ocean crossings, served largely by the Vekllei International Jetport and the historic Port of Vekllei respectively.\nTransport Most Vekllei people do not own private autos, though they are available. Only 6% of the population possesses a driver license, and so most Vekllei people are dependent on the free and comprehensive network of transit systems that link settlement in the island, including trains of various guages, maglevs, trams, trolley busses, ferries, canal steamers, helijets, jets and light aircraft.\nVekllei has one of the highest density rail networks in the world, with some 14,000 kilometres of rail of various gauges. Trains vary from maglev hypertrains that connect Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Five Crown Cities to steam locomotives still in use for cultural reasons in the Home Island\u0026rsquo;s rural interior. Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s smallest rail gauge used in commercial service spans fifteen inches, and is commonly found in mountainous local service. Vekllei simultaneously has the oldest passenger locomotives in regular service in the world alongside some of the newest, including regular overhauls and innovations in maglev and bullet train types.\nThe Vekllei coast is ringed by various rail types, including the Coastal Bullet Train Network and a series of fast trams. A coastal highway, known as Motorway One, links Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s single continuous neighbourhood by road. Motorways are not generally speed limited in Vekllei.\nFor most Vekllei people, automobiles are accessed via autopools, shared vehicle depots that operate like rental cars for trips not easily made via public transit. Licenses are required to drive, though this is rarely enforced and few drivers renew their licenses, especially outside of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s urban centres.\nVekllei has five state air carriers, which constitute a government monopoly on all air travel in the country. The international flag carrier is Vekllei Overseas Airways, which serves air routes internationally with a fleet of various aircraft, including nuclear monowings and supersonic jets.\nHousing Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s borough municipalities maintain a monopoly on real estate purchase in the country, although the national government and high court retain the right of compulsory acquisition. Most neighbourhoods are planned by municipal architects, leading some to call Vekllei an \u0026lsquo;architocracy\u0026rsquo;. Homes in planned neighbourhoods are often awarded via a lottery system in places of high demand, or are otherwise floated freely on the market. It is common for housing to be dependent on employment, especially in the Capital Region, and real estate often forms part of viede compaszion, or \u0026lsquo;life compensation,\u0026rsquo; which is how most business in Vekllei rewards labour.\nLand ownership is common and usually proven by stewardship. Place-metaphysics in Upen also portion ownership between multiple agents simultaneously; the municipality, the land itself, architecture and the homeowner may all share ownership over land, awarded by common interest, community and utility. Although this muddies a traditional understanding of property, all homes in Vekllei are de facto owned by their residents, except in certain professions.\nHomes are also commonly inherited in Vekllei. All Vekllei people are guaranteed a right to home and property under the Petticoat Constitution. Some 92% of adults own their residence in Vekllei.\nCommunications ‚ùñ Main article: Post in Vekllei  The Royal Mail of Vekllei is the postal service of the country, and counts among its oldest surviving institutions. Founded in 1422, its origins as a military communications organ manifest today in its contemporary designation as a military state requisite, rather than civilian postal carrier. Despite this, the Royal Mail remains thoroughly civilian in its oversight and practice, and delivers around 50 million mail pieces a day in peak periods, including courier work abroad.\nTelephones, telegrams and videophones are structured under the Mail as the Office of Telecommunications, which acts as an independent organ of the Mail A.r.\nPower \u0026amp; Water Utilities are provided for by the national Thunderburo (the Hydro, Geo, Nuclear-Electric Commissions) and the Hydroburo (Water Commission) across the country, which were reestablished upon independence in 2015, both managed as proper bureaus of majority government ownership. Vekllei operates sixteen nuclear power plants, but most nuclear energy is sold to Europe via undersea cables. All domestic electricity is supplied by Geothermal power plants and Hydroelectric dams for political and religious reasons, making Vekllei one of the only countries of its size to rely exclusively on renewable energy supply for residential and commercial services.\nVekllei has the cleanest drinking water in the world, supplied by the country\u0026rsquo;s interior freshwater glaciers. Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Hydroburo is also responsible for sewerage treatment and processing in the country.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/territories/kalina/","title":"Kalina"},{"content":"","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/drafts/landscape/","title":"Landscape"},{"content":"","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/newsdesk/","title":"Newsdesk"},{"content":"","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/newsdesk/essays/","title":"Essays"},{"content":" .markdown a { color: var(--color-yellow); }  Back to Issues  From the Editor Welcome to the fourth issue of The Atlantic. Good posts this month. Bit of a smorgasbord, with stories covering all sorts of things. Most importantly, as was mentioned last month: I want to start a comic.\nHow do you go about starting a comic? I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much of a trick to it, as a first-timer ‚Äî you just have to ‚Äôstart‚Äô. It‚Äôs difficult for me, not just because I‚Äôm still learning to draw, but also because a comic in the Vekllei format should help the utopian ‚Äôsocial dream‚Äô of the project ‚Äî that‚Äôs what the ‚Äúauthor‚Äù category of posts means. So a comic would not just have to tell an exciting story with a linear plot and action ‚Äî it would have to be immersive; a guide to the world; something you could revisit time and time again without needing to follow a linear story. Figuring out how to do that is complicated. I‚Äôll set aside some time in September to start exploring this concept seriously.\nI‚Äôd also like to do a short animation/music video for a bit of fun. 80s technopunk vapourwave irony aesthetics are last year ‚Äî what about a bit of postwar austerity to anticipate the coming global recession? Forget bright-coloured sneakers and Windows 98 interfaces ‚Äî how about some council housing and cardigans?\nI guess we‚Äôll have to wait and see.\nThanks for reading, and I\u0026rsquo;d also like to thank the contributor to this edition, Bike (Milky), for their wonderful essay on Vekllei ecofeminism. It‚Äôs an excellent read ‚Äî check it out below. If you would like to contribute to The Atlantic with writing, art or reviews relevant to the spirit of petticoat ideology, please contact Hobart at melonkony@icloud.com before the 30th of September.\nThank you for supporting Vekllei, and best wishes.\nHobart Phillips Enjoy ‚Äî Ê•Ω„Åó„Çì„Åß\n I. News \u0026amp; Announcements  I‚Äôve gone back to work at the news organ I used to work at ‚Äî I might have a little less time, but I‚Äôll have a little more money, and that‚Äôs nice. Hoping to draw more in September, riding off the fun I had in August. The wiki (called Zelda Wiki ‚Äî good luck buying any domain with the word ‚ÄúZelda‚Äù in it) is coming along well. Rather than writing every article in advance ‚Äî a leviathan task ‚Äî I‚Äôm preparing a few intro covering the country of Vekllei and the characters of my story. It‚Äôs live now ‚Äî but good luck finding the URL for it. It‚Äôll be done before the end of the year, but it‚Äôs not nearly finished yet. The post ‚ÄúAbsolute Quiet‚Äù really took off on reddit and netted me nearly another 1,000 subscribers on r/vekllei. Awesome! It‚Äôs not hard to cross-post work and it pays off, especially as I get better. This piece worked out really well ‚Äî if only I could paint cities as nicely. That‚Äôs a long-term ambition, unfortunately. The website is ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù in big scare-quotes. It‚Äôs just a blog replicating reddit posts for now ‚Äî that‚Äôll change once the wiki is complete and accessible. The parallax isn‚Äôt cropped properly on mobile and there‚Äôs a few errors with icons loading in, but it‚Äôs better than the broken hub with no content that was there before. As a reminder, www.millmint.net and www.vekllei.com now redirect to www.millmint.studio!   II. Tzipora-watch In August of 2067, Tzipora wrote to the office of the Sun-Cola Beverage Company professing a love of their soda. The letter was so heartfelt and congratulatory that the chief operations officer invited her to tour their bottling plant in Demon, during which she met several of the staff responsible for her favourite flavours. They sent her home with a basketful of Sun-Cola merchandise and a wristwatch shaped like a bottle cap that still works to this day. Tzipora made a habit of writing to her favourite companies, and as a result has visited a lot of places of industry the ordinary person might never think to go.\n III. Vekllei Fact of the Month Despite the prevalence of nuclear power in Vekllei, over 60 per cent of the country‚Äôs civil power is produced by geothermal and hydroelectric power stations. This is in part a result of Upen‚Äôs intuitive emphasis on renewable local resources (not just for sustainability, but for deep integration and dependence with the physical landscape), but also because much of Vekllei‚Äôs nuclear power is sold abroad via undersea powerlines in Europe and the United States, to supplement ageing fission plants.\n IV. WordBook Endoanotetmouisa ‚Äî translates literally as ‚ÄúPrincess belonging to the Earth,‚Äù often mistranslated as ‚ÄúPrincess of the Earth‚Äù. A highly uncomfortable nickname given to Tzipora in a news article written about her, shortly after her first mainstream appearance ‚Äî a student documentary about building her house in Montre-Lola. Her interviews in the film sparked widespread interest in the girl, both for her medical condition and her extraordinary childhood, and so she spent much of the summer of 2083 in the Azores trying avoid this nickname.\n V. The Bulletin Absolute Grotesque üìñ Published 31st August 2020 | Read here.\n On the morning of the second day, I watched a fly crawl across the cheek of the middle-aged woman, probably an office worker, lying next to me. It moved up her cheekbone to her temple, stopping now and then to rub its front legs as though performing a ritual. A jagged tear ran down the leg of her dark blue work trousers, but the white calf it revealed was miraculously unscathed. The woman lay still. Probably dead, I assumed. After a while, the fly got on to her eyelid. Suddenly, she reached up and brushed it away, opening the eye. There was still a moist light inside.\n From Insects, by Seirai Y≈´ichi\n By chance, the glass paperweight had survived. When her in-laws‚Äô house had burnt down in Yokohama, the paperweight was among those things that she‚Äôd frantically stuffed into an emergency bag, and now it was her only souvenir of life in her girlhood home.\n  From evening on, in the alley, she could hear the strange cries of the neighbourhood girls. Rumour had it that they could make a thousand yen in a single night. Now and then she would find herself holding the forty-sen paperweight she had bought after ten days of indecision when she was these girls‚Äô age, and as she studied the sweet little dog in relief, she would realise with a shock that there was not a single dog left in the whole burnt-out neighbourhood.\n From The Silver Fifty-Sen Pieces, by Kawabata Yasunari\nOn the 14th of August 2111, the Atomic War began in a Chinese submarine in the South Pacific, and ended six hours later. The war marks the single greatest loss of life in human history and would disrupt human life on Earth in previously unimaginable ways ‚Äî consumer society bottomed out, the world became small, the Earth grew cold, and a new chapter in human history was opened.\nThis political map marks the territories of Earth as they stand five years on, in 2116. There are fewer countries in the world today than in any other point in human history, in part because the catastrophic reduction in human population ‚Äî some 520-600 millions in the first year ‚Äî has emptied out countries and rendered others uninhabitable. Many of these territories here are disputed and, in some cases, autonomous ‚Äî for simplicity, they are presented as they are recognised by the U.N. The map also presents a long-exposure view of the war as it happened, and its remaining fallout currents today. Red dots mark significant nuclear detonations on August 14th. Yellow dots mark surface warfare in some capacity. Red trails mark missile flight, reduced in number here by strict denuclearisation treaties of the decades previous. Yellow trails mark the flight paths of atomic bombers, both supersonic and subsonic. This map does not record failed launches, intercepted missiles or downed aircraft.\nFighting was arranged along political axes ‚Äî namely Western (U.S., U.K., West Germany \u0026amp; N.A.T.O. members), Warsaw Pact (U.S.S.R., Cuba, Egypt), East Asian (China \u0026amp; Korea), and non-aligned (Vekllei, France, Brazil). The war experience was unique to each country ‚Äî Vekllei exchanged warheads and bombs with China but not Warsaw countries, the U.S.S.R. exchanged with both Western and East Asian members, and Brazil fought a catastrophic war against both Soviet and American territories. The immediate aftermath saw a quiet Earth, much of it scorched. Temperatures dropped by 10 degrees centigrade for the first six months, and slowly warmed as debris cleared in the following years. Wide-scale firestorms were tempered by rains that followed the war shortly.\nSome 274 millions of the dead are accounted for in China, where in 2116 the cities still lie in rot, swollen with corpses; heavy with miasma; concrete dams bleached and cracked; the wood all burned up; the rivers warped and quiet; dead fish along them; a surfaced water main weeping blood; harsh asbestine whistling; railcars in a ditch; sloughing skin; tremors; smoke with no fires; confused wandering; bleeding from the inside; families-as-sand; sand-as-trinitite.\nExchanges were confused, helter-skelter, and the combatants rattle off like a death snare. The U.S.S.R., the U.S., France, and Vekllei all exchanged death with China.\nIt would take more than mere annihilation to extinguish the P.R.C., but the toll was nauseating. Beijing and Shanghai were simply disappeared; there was nothing where there once was. The fistfuls of rebar and concrete amidst glassy, ossified landscape were heaped into direct administration of the U.N. The following year, 40-120 million more Chinese would succumb to the greatest famine in the history of the world. Of course, in the U.N., there was good argument for the nuclear retaliation ‚Äî China launched first; why should money and food go to the perpetrator of the vastest disaster in human history? One can‚Äôt help but wonder if the life of an Oriental coolie wells fewer tears than his equivalent in Paris. There are not enough flowers in the world to pay tribute to the dead of China, who were simply dispensed with in European memory and subsumed in part by the United Nations. The communist party would continue to control the vast interior, divided into two states by ethnography, where 1949 seemed closer than ever. Necrotic politics are legitimised in the land of the dead. Soon, we saw the consolidation of nation-states into geographic regions with a disregard for ethnography not seen since the colonial years. This was met with violent resistance in some places ‚Äî in others, locals capitulated to the extraordinary hyperreality of the postwar world.\nThe United Nations was quickly catapulted into the status of a de facto administrative world government in a last-ditch attempt to ‚Äòfreeze time‚Äô as it were, in order to provide the superpowers time to recover from the scope of immediate devastation and prevent humanity from entering a long period of decline. This involved the moving of soldiers on a scale unseen since the World Wars, as U.N. international brigades propped up vulnerable, scorched territories in Central/Western Europe and Asia. The immediate peace of the first days after the war was ruthlessly enforced ‚Äî and strategic opportunism was threatened to meet indiscriminate violence and U.N.-sanctioned nuclear retaliation. There was some belief that the status quo could carry on. So troops of non-combatant countries were supplied, and in some cases press-ganged, into this global mission.\nThe battered United States, acknowledging its ‚Äòcentury of decline‚Äô, found itself consolidating control over its urban, though devastated, coasts. The awkward appellation \u0026ldquo;Dallas America\u0026rdquo; was used as a colloquial shorthand for a disputed territory that insisted on referring to itself as the legitimate United States. The name was only superseded by the ridiculous \u0026ldquo;United Nations Heartlands of the United States,\u0026rdquo; the Aid Region of the U.S. interior that had collapsed in the days after the war. This was buffered by the Mojave and Great Lakes Special Administrative Regions, federal territories that contained war industry and nuclear infrastructure that propped up the precarious coasts. Despite efforts to revive agriculture in the scorched U.N. Heartlands U.S., starvation was met with martial law along the coasts the following year.\nThe U.N. was granted temporary, direct control over several collapsed territories that had either succumbed to nuclear fire or had caved to anarchy in the weeks and months after. In some cases, like the U.N. regions in Hawaii, Jerusalem and the Central Europe International War Government, these behaved as states in themselves, administrated directly by the United Nations Mission for War Recovery. In others, they were merely named as such with the vague promise of future aid. U.N. Cuba and U.N. Taiwan were such examples, in which devastation had been so catastrophic that little remained to govern, and the local population was mostly left to anarchy. In general, there were great inequalities in how the U.N. chose to dedicate resources, largely informed by its largest nation-states and political interests.\nThere are thousands of stories from communities and territories across the world directly impacted by the war ‚Äî from the atomic bombing of Sydney to the catastrophic reactor meltdowns of Brazil‚Äôs south. The war was unprecedented in scale and devastation. This map reveals little of the profoundly human tragedy that was brought about, nor does it invoke the difficult existential artefacts that are still being reckoned with. Perhaps humans are just animals after all ‚Äî destined to die out the way so many have in this age. Most tragic was not the colossal scale of death, or the collapse and pain that followed, but the upending of domestic society into violence, in which people of consumer society ‚Äî the middle class ‚Äî found themselves with not much at all, thrust into a world of chaos and suffering in which all prior epistemologies evaporated. Like the flash of blue light that preceded the roar, it was the stuff in supermarkets and department stores that marked the absolute grotesqueing of life in the new age.\n 2,000 members! WOW! üìñ Published 27th August 2020 | Read here.\nHello,\nI‚Äôm Hobart. I‚Äôve been working on this project for a while now. It doesn‚Äôt really have a purpose or an end goal ‚Äî I just want to draw and write about nice things, and I‚Äôm learning a lot on the way. Welcome to everyone new here. I don‚Äôt really have anything to sell, I‚Äôd just like to thank you for tuning in and checking Vekllei out.\nI‚Äôve drawn Tzipora here as a sort of Sailor Moon knock-off. Good show that. The Japanese intro is very nostalgic, I‚Äôd love to do a little animated short in that style.\nI post about twice a week. I do a bit of everything ‚Äî machines, maps, characters, landscapes, architecture, etc. I‚Äôm truly a master of none.\nYou can come join the Discord if you‚Äôd like ‚Äî it‚Äôs just a quiet community to share interests and talk: discord.gg/dCE6vSU\nOtherwise, I‚Äôll keep doing what I‚Äôm doing and you can keep liking my stuff (please). If you have any questions about the project, or just want to introduce yourselves, here‚Äôs a good place to do it! Thank you kindly to all commenters, readers and friends of the project, whether you‚Äôve been here for years or for six hours ‚Äî it‚Äôs very special to have so many people interested in work that‚Äôs so close to my heart.\nKeep on keeping on,\nHobart\n Absolute Quiet üìñ Published 24th August 2020 | Read here.\nThere were plumes in the sky, sent from bunkers buried deep in the well of the Earth, killing with switches. Vekllei went to war, and so Tzipora went to war with it.\nThe throbbing machinery of another world began turning, and anyone who saw the bomb would hear it. Passing seconds dislocated and caught heartbeats. The plumes were pretty. It was such a shame, those plumes. It was a quiet afternoon in the flower-tundras.\nThere was an absolute quiet among the grasses, and peace in her heart. She had work to do. She was a warden, after all ‚Äî and she‚Äôd done a good job spotting the missile before the sirens caught up. In truth, any devastation seemed incomprehensible. The flower-tundra would last forever. But that was her job, and she had to do it.\nShe left her bucket by the freshwater creek, intending to retrieve it a while later. The drinking water tasted better up here. She turned from the plume and followed the moss path out of the flower-tundra. Her village was before her.\nSo ended the old ways and so started the new.\n Rural Newda in Rural Vekllei üìñ Published 17th August 2020 | Read here.\nNew gouache brushes, this painting was done on a single layer. turned out pretty good. more paintings to come.\nNewda is Vekllei‚Äôs national architectural ideology, applied flexibly in a range of modernist styles developed domestically in her architecture schools. Broadly, Newda buildings emphasise distinction from the surrounding landscape (called Dumousiantopet, or ‚Äòbeautiful and seperate‚Äô), natural decay, and honesty in material and construction. Vekllei‚Äôs great Parliament House is Newda; as are the little rural homes found in the mountains inland in Vekllei.\nTzipora‚Äôs house in the village of Montre-Lola (as depicted on the map here) is built in what Vekllei calls ‚ÄúAzores revivalism‚Äù, a Newda style heavily influenced by the stripped deco and streamline moderne buildings of a century prior. It is part of a constant conversation Newda holds with its past, as both a deeply modernist, progressive school and one bound up in the wider aesthetic and cultural traditions of Upen, the spiritualism of Vekllei.\nHer house is small, but appears larger due to the layout of the structure. A small sleeping loft sits atop the living, bathing and cooking areas of the home, and opens out into a private rooftop garden. The utilities tower also hides a small staircase leading to the roof, which is also accessible for outdoor recreation. Her home stands amidst the farmland of Montre-Lola, and very near the library and primary school where she works. Her property is marked at its end by a creek that runs into the Dentre River. She has a vegetable garden in her backyard, and shares her paddocks with her neighbours for grazing periodically throughout the year.\nHer house was erected in gratitude by her neighbours out of prefab components, and assisted by a ‚Äúconstruction line,‚Äù ‚Äî a temporary rail line in which goods are delivered and cranes are supported, minimising the need for lorries. Houses of this type and period are rarely seen in agricultural settings in other countries, but in Vekllei, where Landscape has been abolished, there might as well be no difference between a building suitable for the cosmopolitan, coastal cities and a dwelling for a farmer-girl.\n The Thousand-Year-Old Girl üìñ Published 12th August 2020 | Read here.\nThe concept of living forever jumps out at people uncomfortable with their own existence. There is a contemplative instinct among educated people that ‚Äî if they could simply will themselves into a state of self-actualisation ‚Äî death would only be an obstacle to greatness.\nAs Tzipora found out quickly, the opposite was true ‚Äî death and temporality were wells of meaning against which all great people, beauty, and human constructions were cast.\nTzipora Desmoisnes is what is known as a Gregori Baby, a catch-all term for a unique genetic condition that has seemingly produced a variety of miracle children appropriate for the frothing futurism of the atomic age ‚Äî boys and girls who, suspended in the purity and good-naturedness of childhood ‚Äî live forever.\nThere is no single ‚ÄúGregori Baby‚Äù ‚Äî each is unique, and Tzipora is the 13th to have been recognised overall. The phrase is a shortening of Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome, a stand-in for medical information that isn‚Äôt there. The first, Gregori Hordiyenko, was born in 2024. He was healthy, and died of unrelated causes in his 20s. Tzipora, at 13th, continues to live to this day and is the oldest person on Earth.\nThere is a disturbing trend among the Gregori children, first heralded as miracles and symptoms of the space age, to deteriorate medically as more are born. The culprit is the malfunctioning of telomeres in their DNA ‚Äî the source of their longevity ‚Äî which regularly produce devastating chromosomal disorders, including Trisomy 13 \u0026amp; 18, killing most ‚Äúageless children‚Äù before their third birthday. Those that survive are often victims of a severe anaphylaxis caused by a hyperactive immune system ‚Äî rendering many of them permanently sickly. Others find themselves unageing, but continue to grow ‚Äî reaching as tall as 2.5m before their bodies give out from exhaustion and osteoporosis.\nSo what is Gregori syndrome? What does your average (healthy) Gregori baby look like? Their genetic miracle is linked to the structures of the body that activate at puberty, and so girls vary between 11-16 years of age at onset depending on many factors that affect their development. Boys tend to be a little younger, from 8-14. Between the two, girls tend to be more stable, and all but two of the supercentenarian Gregori children are female.\nAmong girls, they are prepubescent and generally stop ageing on the eve of menarche, or their first period. In Tzipora‚Äôs case, her body is estimated to be 13 years and 11 months old. Unlike many Gregori children, Tzipora lives in a wealthy country and has volunteered for extensive research into her genetic makeup, meaning that much of early medical documentation around Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome was received directly from her case.\nMost obvious is that, at a foundational level, her cells are similar in function to unipotent stem cells, and have been since hormones at the end of thelarche suspended her ageing. This change has occurred somewhere in her DNA ‚Äî exactly where is unknown ‚Äî but the end result is that, unlike regular progenitor cells that make up most adult bodies, the building blocks of her body are capable of cell-renewal. Her telomeres, the endcaps of chromosomal DNA in mammals, are undamaged. And so there is an amazing shift in her basic human structure ‚Äî in which human cell lineage, which usually ends in a mature cell incapable of division, is caught and rearranged. With this considered, it is no wonder that Gregori children suffer from such catastrophic chromosomal instability, and why healthy ageless babies are a rarity. Her body is not exactly a ‚Äúbody of stem cells,‚Äù but for their function in a healthy Gregori child, they might as well be.\nSo it is that nothing about Tzipora is changing. She suffers from pains in her legs often ‚Äî called growing pains, although they are not from growing ‚Äî and her cells continue to replenish, albeit at a rate 1.25 times that of normal people. She is, in essence, ‚Äúgrowing‚Äù as any other premenarchal girl would, but she is not getting bigger or becoming older.\nTzipora is blessed with an adult life in Vekllei, where the ‚ÄúChild‚Äù does not exist as it does in the West, and her individual freedoms are far-ranging. She may smoke, and drink, and has held many different jobs in her life. She holds two doctorates in English and Vekllei Literature. She is obviously sterile ‚Äî even if she were to somehow ‚Äúage out‚Äù of prepubescence into pubescence and receive the required hormones, she simply lacks the genetic code to reproduce ‚Äî but raises many children through her active participation in village life and her roles as Montre-Lola‚Äôs municipal and school librarian.\nIn other countries, with coded roles for children, their problems are much greater. Unable to form adult relationships and often incapable of finding work, many work in entertainment or fall into poverty as they outlive their friends and parents. Socially ostracised and forever young, many are victims of superstition and fear. As the pattern of Gregori children indicates an increase in mortality, even as more are born, their appearance is both a miracle and a tragedy ‚Äî ageing not through mitosis but through weathering the societies in which they live.\n The 31st Century ‚Äî Vekllei throughout our Solar System üìñ Published 9th August 2020 | Read here.\nWe‚Äôve spent a lot of time in the 21st century ‚Äî but Tzipora is biologically immortal. Where does she go from here? Well, let‚Äôs enjoy a small glimpse at that future together, by winding the clock forward one thousand years.\nBy 3076, our Solar System is a pleasant place to be. Most of the planets we once gazed at from afar are now habitable and lived on. The Great Epoch of Rest has begun.\nThere is no great interstellar empire, no rise and fall of spacefaring supernations ‚Äî a Vekllei way of life is now lived out in multicultural, prosperous clusters of people across our Solar System. The ordinary person is afforded incredible freedoms previously reserved for science fiction through the accessibility of personal light spacecraft, translated literally as ‚Äúboats‚Äù.\nThis here is the M-7000 APRICOT, manufactured by the Government Aerospace Factories (GAF) of Vekllei. Many companies are contracted by the GAF, including General Reactor S.A., to whom this boat lends most of its flight control systems and all of its power plant. It is a light, personal boat for women built in 2807, making it relatively unique in both its 28th century design language and its gendered marketing. While the personal boat market was growing rapidly by this time, the vast majority of owners and pilots were men. The APRICOT set out to change that, and Tzipora, the world‚Äôs oldest living person with a youthful face, was among the first to demonstrate the accessibility and freedoms of space travel for women and girls in the personal boat market. It was her first boat, and despite its orientation for women it was christened with a male name: BARON.\nIt is a comfortable and pleasant craft that can be lived in for extended periods of time. Tzipora has done just that, travelling to stars in search of water-planets with Micronesian archipelagos, where she likes to spend most of her time. Its glass roof across the entire accessible cabin, including bubbled cockpit, gives it breathtaking visibility in the depths of space and the most scenic of planets alike. Like almost all spacecraft, it is unarmed, save for the pacifying ‚Äújazz‚Äù electric canon, named for its firing sound reminiscent of a double bass strum.\nWhen she tires of being alone, she returns to her hometown of Montre-Lola in Vekllei frequently. Boats are usually parked at off-world stations, preserving the aerospace and quiet of the Solar System. Light speed is exceeded through superluminal travel. So-called black boxes require extraordinarily precise programming, since superluminal travel is in all ways but name time travel, and the universe does not tolerate time travel. Coordinates calculated in the universal pyramid system by a pyramid computer ensure that a vessel arrives when it arrives, so to speak. The alternative is going nowhere at all ‚Äî there is no in-between.\nSuperluminal systems are affected by gravity, so any person looking to exceed the speed of light and subsequently visit other stars must take the highways beyond our home system‚Äôs planetary orbit and launch into so-called free-travel from there. There are only a handful of these highways ‚Äî the solar system is very, very large, and human construction is very, very small.\nThere was an instinct among many people that human progress would naturally scale exponentially ‚Äî these were extrapolated from the remarkable progress in the lifetime of Tzipora‚Äôs parents and grandparents, who saw canvas aircraft in their childhood advance to the landing of a man on the moon, and again in her own exaggerated lifetime, in which the provinciality of her youth has simultaneously seen an expansion and exploitation of the planets in our native solar system.\nThis curve of progress was not to be, however ‚Äî and it also explains why we had such trouble meeting aliens in the first place. Part of it was simply that there are very few worlds with water that also formed earthlike landmasses nearby ‚Äî there are many aliens, and Tzipora has seen many herself, but most of them are fish and fish-adjacent. The second is that, if there is civilised life out there, it has most probably encountered the same engineering truths that humanity did, in our great interstellar project of the last thousand years. Namely that, all accounted for, there is no use for wasteful megastructures when a small one will do. People are having less children ‚Äî on Mars, Mercury and Neptune, the population is actually shrinking. What good is the so-called ‚Äúocean liner of the stars,‚Äù with a capacity of millions? There are around 12 billion people across the solar system today. Maybe another 8 billion in the Ala system. Maybe a few millions more who have simply given up society for scattered stars in our neighbourhood.\nIt is likely that if any other civilised races exist, they are simply of our scale, or have destroyed themselves completely in the reckless pursuit of expansion. Humanity is lucky not to count themselves among them.\nThe APRICOT is one of many models produced by Vekllei‚Äôs Government Aerospace Factories. It is now possible for the ordinary person to explore distant stars for themselves, granting freedoms unimaginable in a previous age. Such is life in the Great Epoch of Rest.\n VI. The Post Office Not a Particularly Environmentalist Bunch: Vekllei‚Äôs Feminist Natureculture [NEW] BY MILKY#0144\nAll direct quotes are from Melon‚Äôs Reddit posts or saved from his previous website.\nThink about nature. Picture it in your mind. What do you see? Are there any buildings? Do you see your friends, or any people at all? What adjectives might you use to describe it? How do you interact with nature in your mind?\nThere is a divide between human society and what is considered ‚Äònature‚Äô ‚Äì landscapes, national parks or forests, beaches, mountain trails, campgrounds\u0026hellip; Nature is often seen as a place you visit and a place you come home from. A temporary escape from societal woes. A vacation spot; perhaps someplace nostalgic. A special area, with boundaries and signs and info centers, that should be protected. It has also been seen as something owed to humans ‚Äì wilderness to be tamed and dominated, or land to be cleared, excavated, drilled, and paved for capitalist human use.\nTraditional environmental ethics heavily involves romantic, heroic, and nurturing narratives in regard to the relationship among humans, nonhuman animals, and this ‚Äònature.‚Äô Empathy, care, and connection have been key in ecofeminist discourse on environmentalism and nonhuman animal rights. These values are traditionally feminine, and environmentalism is often seen as feminine as a result. Terms like treehugger exemplify the feminine care given by environmentalists. Another term, ‚Äòsoy boy,‚Äô does not necessarily point to environmentalists, but ‚Äòsoy‚Äô being a feminine quality implies alternatives to animal products being something only for women.\nParallel to environmentalism being a feminine work, nature is often coded as female. Mother Nature nurtures living beings, feeding plants and animals alike. Western romantic authors wrote comparisons between women and nature and were inspired by both alike. They are something beautiful to look at and something to find inspiration in. They are pure and untouched until man/humans tame and mold them.\n‚ÄúVekllei is a fundamentally female country. This is what petticoat society means.‚Äù This does not mean that the feminised, pure, idealised nature persists. Take our protagonist Tzipora for example. She is female, yet not an idealised maternal woman that could possibly be confused for a Mother Nature figure. She is an eternal child, neither pure or innocent, nor in need of care and protection. If we consider the following quote, however, we can see how Tzipora‚Äôs situation reflects or is reflected in Vekllei‚Äôs unique environmentalist situation: ‚ÄúVekllei is not alienated from its landscape but exists very much within it. Vekllei people do not consider themselves different from nature \u0026ndash; they exist alongside everything else in the landscape. Their environment is not exploited, and so its protection is not necessitated through its abstraction and alienation, of which environmentalism is a symptom (as a reaction to exploitation).‚Äù Though Tzipora is very different from the rest of her community, she is not alienated from those around her. She is enmeshed in Vekllei‚Äôs culture and society and dutifully participates in school and work. She is inseparable from her environment.\nIn fact, ‚ÄúVekllei has abolished landscape, deconstructing its vicious abstractionism.‚Äù In Vekllei, nature is not seen as ‚Äòother‚Äô or as romantically female, and this binary of human/nature has been removed. Of course, it is impossible to abolish landscape and our artist would not paint and describe such rich landscapes if they no longer existed. Paintings of Vekllei often depict Zelda and co., concrete buildings, and railways contrasted with the country‚Äôs rolling hills, grassy plains, and volcanic rock. The combination of humans and both their built and ‚Äònatural‚Äô environs is what makes up the Vekllei landscape, as there is no separation in Vekllei between nature and society. Everything in each painting is the natural landscape of Vekllei.\nSo, what has been abolished is the idea that nature is another place, something separate than the culture of Vekllei. In the 2020 Vekllei Handbook, MelonKony writes: ‚ÄúWe are not a particularly environmentalist bunch, since we\u0026rsquo;re not alienated from our land, and we‚Äôre certainly not sentimental, but we do understand the relationship our lives have with our surrounds, and the utility and protection of nature is important to us as a lifestyle and a spiritual tenant of Upen.‚Äù\nIf the respectful utility and protection of nature is important, wouldn‚Äôt such a way of living with nature, being human as part of the natural world, lead to environmentalism? Not necessarily. ‚ÄúNature is a fellow social organ, like society or family, and so Vekllei is not ‚Äòenvironmentalist‚Äô in the Western idea of the word but instead makes use of and protects its natural environment for the benefit of both themselves and the land.‚Äù\nThink now about what surrounds you. The air, your room, your home, your town, and beyond. When you think about what is important to you about the natural world, imagine what your Ghibli/Tintin landscape would look like. Don‚Äôt forget to include the buildings and people in your orbit. There is no real boundary between you and the community you live and work in and the larger ‚Äúnatural world.‚Äù It is all part of the natural world. No need to call yourself particularly environmentalist even if you care about the world around you. You are still just as enmeshed with nature as our Vekllei friends are.\n VII.

Quiet month ‚Äî not a bad thing in the slightest.   II. Tzipora-watch In September of 2073, Tzipora began work at the Lola District Library at the age of 26, a move that would develop within her a love of librarianship that would see her enrol in Montre-Lola University to study literature two years later. Her time at Lola was spent managing loans and navigating visitors through the vast archives beneath by way of a light monorail.\n III. Vekllei Fact of the Month Upen designates a hierarchy in the human body as part of ritualistic processions. The heart, depicted as a crown, is considered the most sacred. The brain and hands are next, and the rest of the body is catalogued and ordered ending with the feet. Feet are considered unclean in Vekllei and is part of the reason why shoes are not worn indoors. This hierarchy, called Lohsmi, is a minor cultural force but is important in the physical formation of runes, or Upotenne (spirit-hand-talk).\n IV. WordBook Spiousn ‚Äî difficult to translate, spiousn describes the feeling of regaining energy after a long period of exhaustion. It can be applied to a sick person becoming well, or more contemporaneously to a student after the exam period. This word forms a component of the slang spiousnya, which refers to the break from school at the end of the year. In this sense, its meaning translates to ‚Äúschool break‚Äù but carries with it a sentiment of peace and recovery.\n V. The Bulletin Baron, the Father üìñ Published 30th September 2020 | Read here.\nPeople are not sure what to make of Baron. They are not sure what to make of his daughter, Tzipora, either. To that end, they are lucky to have found each other.\nHis obscurity is part of a severe disposition, made obvious by his astonishing disinterest in friends and hobbies. When he finishes work, he listens to the radio, prepares supper, and goes to bed. His unrelenting seriousness is mitigated by his general passivity ‚Äî Baron is a man totally in control, who keeps to himself and does not take issue with what goes on around him. For his seriousness he is not particularly judgemental or opinionated. To call him boring would be a poor characterisation; he simply feels he has done enough and is not looking to complicate the basic equations of his life.\nTzipora (Zelda to him) complicates this equation. She‚Äôs similar to him in many ways, with her conservative personal disposition and humble lifestyle. She does not make a very good teen-ager.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs funny you say that. I was talking to her the other day, and she was talking about how nice it was to have some peace and quiet,‚Äù Baron once confided in Ayn. ‚ÄúOf course, she looks very young, so sometimes you have to remind yourself that she‚Äôs not a child. She‚Äôs not thirteen, she‚Äôs nineteen, and very unusual, I think. She‚Äôs very smart but she doesn‚Äôt let that on much.‚Äù\nTzipora did not really have ‚Äúphases‚Äù ‚Äî Tzipora was Tzipora, eternal. But she was a much more emotionally attuned person, and her highs were higher and her lowers were lower than anything Baron had felt in decades.\nHe was not always so unfeeling. Baron‚Äôs Ashkenazim parents were pulled straight from the bubbling diaspora of Eastern Europe. They met in the labour zionist movement, but fell out of love with professional organising and immigrated to a struggling Vekllei to work in the national hydroelectricity scheme, among thousands of immigrants employed by the Thunderburo.\nHe was born in 2027 and was not very interested in school as a child. He was rebellious and obstinate, and had only vague ambitions of acquiring a trade certificate in motorcycle repair. His sister, Amelie, died of tuberculosis when he was 11. That was about the end of school ambitions for him.\nHe started conscription early and spent his high school years in an army college. By the time he was 18, he was transferred to military police. It was 2045. He had started dating a middle school sweetheart, Ayn, two weeks before the war in Taiwan broke out.\nYoung Baron died in Taiwan, and another figure in his body returned. He was transferred almost immediately to a junior post at the Americas Bureau at National Intelligence (AB/NI), where he would spend the next decade. While he was stationed abroad, his mother died and his father followed. By this time, Baron was a significant asset for Vekllei‚Äôs deep autonomous intelligence work ‚Äî apolitical, unattached, unsentimental and steady on his feet. He was destined to die in Colombia, employed indefinitely and waiting to be used up. In 2063, he met a fellow Spanish-speaking Jew by name of Tzipora.\nIn many ways, his identity is as fractured as Tzipora‚Äôs, whose Jewish European ancestry was a novel curiosity and not much more. She considered herself a Latina-American until she was Vekllei, and since then she has not been anything more. That was how it went in Vekllei‚Äôs grand secular melting pot. Tzipora was still ta bubeleh to him, but by his mid-thirties Baron had lost most of his mother‚Äôs Yiddish. Tzipora is his closest friend and daughter at the same time. She is a wholly energetic and independent agent in his life, and their relationship alternates awkwardly but intuitively between father-daughter and old friends. Ayn wonders if it is not a coincidence that Tzipora looks like Amelie, his sister.\nThe two of them champion the redemption of losers; the adrift, empty people of the world, acting on a chance to salvage a life and family. Tzipora expected to die in America; Baron expected nothing at all. But when Christmas comes around, and Ayn visits for supper, Taiwan and America melt into air; and their apartment houses the only Jewish Christmas tree in the neighbourhood.\n Little Bouncy Zelda ‚Äî an animation diary üìñ Published 27th September 2020 | Read here.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been a week since I\u0026rsquo;ve posted. Most of that was spent drawing the same thing over and over.\nA painting? Please. That\u0026rsquo;s a day\u0026rsquo;s work ‚Äî maybe two. A five second loop of Tzipora jumping in and shuffling over? A week.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s difficult to grasp just how much work animation is until you try it. This runs at 12 frames per second (which dickheads will recognise as the anime frame rate). There are maybe 38 unique frames in this tiny animation. It\u0026rsquo;s a title card for my imaginary studio, MillMint, in case I ever make videos in the future.\nThe sketch was fun.

Let me know what you think!\n Memory and Death in the Flower Tundra üìñ Published 19th September 2020 | Read here.\nIt was their first hike after Maya‚Äôs funeral. She had found adult life completely disappointing, and never moved out of home. In her last summer, she developed a desperate fascination with her receding childhood, and eventually took her own life outside of the classroom she‚Äôd studied in as a third-grade student.\nHer death deeply disturbed Tzipora, who was keenly aware of how sentimental people died against metrics of their own imagination. She wondered if the government architects who designed schools and universities considered how those spaces gave life to memories. They were filled with lunchtimes and puppy love and old friends and your parents ‚Äî and those things folded into brick and concrete and linoleum floors. Fifty years earlier, some architect designed a classroom so valuable that Maya took her own life in the memory of it.\nTheir Puffling troop had set off for a camp site two hours away. Tzipora and Zo did not walk with them. They followed the flower tundra north, near where Zo and Maya had played as kids. At the base of an old oak, shrouded in a cool mist, Zo buried a pair of plastic earrings and laced school shoes, neither of which had been worn in a long time. Zo started to cry. Tzipora gave her some time to herself. After a while they drank hot tea with their feet in the creek. The mist had closed them in. There was good reason why people travelled to flower-tundras to meet with the dead. The mirror-pools and tombstone drumlins invoked the spirits.\nAfter the tea, Zo pulled out her map and they set off again for the camp site, leaving the tree behind forever.\n Some kind of gay sketch for my cool subreddit.

I‚Äôm trying to learn to a) paint and b) paint on an industrial scale.\nShe‚Äôd missed the fast tram, caught a tiny splinter in her thumb, lost a button and now the match wouldn‚Äôt strike. It just wasn‚Äôt her day.\nThey were in Callaisn (pronounced ka-lane), a borough of the capital Tzipora regarded as ‚Äúthe worst of them‚Äù for its tall buildings and labyrinthian concrete alleys. ‚ÄúBad people, bad food, bad smells‚Äù she said, flashing the tact she was known for. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go home.‚Äù\nCallaisn was an oddity, built largely by the British during the occupation years in the fashion of London. It was nonetheless a thoroughly Vekllei borough, with its parks and tramways and rivulets, but it had a continental skyline marked by tower blocks and skyscrapers. A lot of boring business was done in Callaisn that Tzipora didn‚Äôt care about.\nCobian frowned as Tzipora rotated a second match between her thumb and finger. She didn‚Äôt like this nasty little habit she‚Äôd picked up. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll smell like your dad if you keep this up,‚Äù she said.\n‚ÄúSuits me,‚Äù said Tzipora.\n Road Trip üìñ Published 11th September 2020 | Read here.\nThey showed up at the autopool, and someone had just returned a brand new AAAC Voya Voya ‚Äî incredible. It was like Christ himself had blessed them. It only (barely) seat five, and there were six of them, but it wasn‚Äôt a problem. Moise would drive, Tzipora bunked with Cobian in the passenger seat and Alise, Zo and Jerome could cram into the back. It was a squeeze but with the top down and on the coastal highway it couldn‚Äôt have mattered less. It was the car of late summer.\nZo had just married Jerome, and they had recently moved in with each other at age 17. Tzipora had no metrics to figure out if that was too young, but Zo was her friend and young newlyweds were lonely people. She was all too ready to volunteer her labour (and that of Cobian and Moise) to drive them down to Koisniya and pick them up a coffee machine she‚Äôd ordered six months prior. Tohs S.p.A. was a good company but Tohs himself was a disorganised bastard and he‚Äôd rung up to a few times to tell her the order had been delayed. Then she called him back a month later and he said he‚Äôd never received the order. So it was that they were on their way now, well after Zo and Jerome had married, to pick up the wedding gift. That was just how things worked in Vekllei.\nZo‚Äôs friend Alise sat the coffee machine in her lap on the way back, and as the coastal highway reached Vik it skirted an incredible series of cliffs that they stopped to look at. The wind was out and the Atlantic churned beneath. The sun was hot on their skin. The coffee machine was left on the tiny back seat as they got out to have a look and take a picture.\n Clean Faces; Full Hearts: Uniforms in Vekllei [8.9.2020] üìñ Published 8th September 2020 | Read here.\nIn Vekllei, uniforms are prevalent across all levels of society. They are perhaps the most obvious example of the opaque contradictions at the heart of Vekllei life, caught between wholly opposing ideas: between tradition and progress; liberty and control; and, most crucially here ‚Äî between individualism and the burden of society.\nDepicted here are uniforms for education ‚Äî Tzipora as a puffling of the Puffin Scouts on the left, and the others in mere school uniforms. These uniforms are universal and used across all ages of schooling, from kindergarten to university. Even some teachers wear them ‚Äî it starts to stretch the conventional imagination about what constitutes a uniform.\nA few observations on this picture:\nFirst, these uniforms are used interchangeably across ages and disciplines. The difference between a red pleat skirt and a navy skirt is trivial; it is merely a difference in the meaning of the clothing, as part of Vekllei semaphore. They are both equally the school-mandated uniform of education, and can be worn interchangeably from one day to the next, in third grade and at university.\nSecond, there are many small uniquenesses in the uniform of each person, which are accentuated by their surrounding uniformity. Tzipora‚Äôs school shirt is pleated along the buttons, acquired off the rack of a department store. One pair of trousers might be a slightly different shade to the pair next to it. These discrepancies are not regarded as malfunctions of the uniform system, since the system is not designed to make each student conform to a single appearance ‚Äî it is about identity and convenience in a country that spent many decades clawing its way out of abject poverty.\nThese principles apply across many workplaces and in government, too ‚Äî where uniforms are not intended to only signify publicly a place of work but instead form social bonds through clothing, which are intimate factors of ordinary life. In Vekllei, clothes are not an expression of personality, but items to communicate and bond with, regulated not by an authority demanding strict conformity but a desire for identity, physicality, infrastructure and convenience.\nSuch a state of affairs is unimaginable in some countries, especially beyond collectivist or conformist cultures. Individualist intuition suggests that uniforms are actively detrimental to personal expression ‚Äî but this idea demands a scale of expression far beyond the preference for subtlety and delicateness in Upen. Deviations from uniformity, like earrings, the way hair is worn, wristwatches, makeup and minor irregularities accentuate the value of those things, and make them more important. This aesthetic contrast is at the heart of the wider Upen intuition that you can see in architecture and political priority alike. And, as any Vekllei boy will tell you ‚Äî seeing a classroom crush out of uniform for the first time is a religious experience, and only afforded by scarcity.\nVekllei is an individualist society, modelled after self-concern and self-love by a salt-of-the-earth and larrikin people of my native Australia. This is not a people compatible with conventional thinking on the regulation of appearance ‚Äî but, as with many things in Vekllei, both are held true at the same time. They are a free and unrestrained population clothed at work and in school in clothes gifted to them. As an addendum, although many readers find common ancestry with Japan in this project (not unreasonably, either), Vekllei has more in common in some ways with the distant neighbours of my Australian homeland ‚Äî countries that haven‚Äôt been glamorised in the West through culture export. Thailand, Cambodia and Laos are among them ‚Äî coincidentally, all three are rare examples of countries where university students wear uniforms.\nSomeday, we‚Äôll look at the aesthetics of power and authority-worship, inspired at least in part by the history and culture of these countries, and associate them with cultural forces in Vekllei.

Big announcements, short bulletin.\nI‚Äôve started work on Atomic Modern, better known as ‚Äôthe Vekllei comic.‚Äô I‚Äôm about five pages in so far. I have a distinct style of illustration, but that doesn‚Äôt always translate well to a panel format, and navigating that fact has been a real challenge. Generally, pages are just taking too long ‚Äî about half a page a day so far. How on earth do some authors produce 500-page tomes? I‚Äôm working on fixing that.\nPatrons will see pages this week! How exciting. I‚Äôll also be in close contact with patrons regarding the upcoming $100/month milestone, and how best to celebrate it.\nAlthough this month was dominated by conversation about the comic, we also saw a mix of posts this month of various types and styles. In future, while balancing regular comic production, I‚Äôll be looking at trimming traditional posts down to about once a week (as in this month) and putting efforts into finishing the website and polishing posts on the subreddit. I want to reign things in a bit ‚Äî explore different samples of Vekllei life playfully and efficiently, and dispense for a moment the traditional story posts, which will be supplemented by the linear story of the comic.\nFinally, if you would like to contribute to The Atlantic with writing, art or reviews relevant to the spirit of petticoat ideology, please contact Hobart at melonkony@icloud.com before the 30th of November.\nThank you for supporting Vekllei, and best wishes.\nHobart Phillips Enjoy ‚Äî Ê•Ω„Åó„Çì„Åß\n I. News \u0026amp; Announcements  My honours thesis is done. Hip hip hooray. At some point in future, once it‚Äôs marked and returned, it‚Äôll be archived on the site alongside other essays I‚Äôve worked on. The site is not done! I‚Äôll be looking to finish the main articles this month, and contributing regularly to expand the content of the site. I‚Äôd rather have fewer, high-quality articles than many stub or low-quality articles. I‚Äôll also be looking for volunteers to help translate the main page and perhaps a key article for newcomers. The Atlantic Bulletin will be archived on the site, so if you‚Äôve missed editions you‚Äôll be able to read them there. The first few pages of the comic will arrive for free on the subreddit sometime this month.   II. Tzipora-watch In October of 2064, Tzipora would begin work as a junior commis chef at a local Spanish restaurant, training under immigrant head chef (and proud Spaniard) Valentino ‚ÄúVal‚Äù Martinez. Tzipora could scarcely speak Vekllei and was berated incessantly by Martinez, who saw her has slow-witted and untalented. In time, however, Tzipora would prove her culinary ability and made good use of her talents at home, preparing simple, fresh cooking in a new country that celebrates local food. She would rise to the rank of sous chef, and enjoyed her work there until she left to finish high school the next year.\n III. Vekllei Fact of the Month Unusually for a country often regarded as European, Vekllei has little popular conception of the Second World War. Although a member of the Axis powers from 1936 thru 1941, Vekllei‚Äôs small navy was entirely sunk within months of the war‚Äôs opening by British naval dominance in the North Atlantic, and by 1942 was press-ganged as a staging point for American aircraft. Vekllei students only spend a few weeks learning about WW2 in mandatory history classes, and it rarely appears in popular culture, a cultural artefact attributed to the general distaste for Junta-era history and the minor role the country played in the war.\n IV. WordBook Sukish ‚Äî pronounced ‚Äúsookie,‚Äù Sukish describes the sensation of warm sunlight on bare skin. Derived from the Loh glossary, it is gentle and playful despite Loh‚Äôs association with moonlight and winter, and is often used poetically in advertisements and ceremonial speech to suggest new beginnings and rebirth. Pictographically, is is depicted as a sun on a crown. Spend too long in the sun, however, and you might suffer Acelouliah, which is the literal word for burning, and is used equally to describe sunburn and burning food.\n V. The Bulletin Major Announcement: A Vekllei Comic üìñ Published 27th October 2020 | Read here.\nHi everyone,\n\u0026ldquo;He not busy being born is busy dying,\u0026rdquo; ‚Äî that‚Äôs off a Bob Dylan bootleg. I‚Äôve just finished my thesis and I‚Äôm busy being born again. Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm busy dying. Drawing‚Äôs been the way out for a long time now.\nAs of today I‚Äôm starting work full-time on a Vekllei comic called Atomic Modern. The front cover looks like a textbook. The name is not that interesting. That‚Äôs okay ‚Äî apparently my honours in media didn‚Äôt do anything for my marketing ability, but this project is about celebrating mundanity and restraint. Tzipora‚Äôs got a fag in her mouth but it isn‚Äôt lit. I feel like that a lot of the time. It‚Äôs a self-contained image.\nAtomic Modern is about Tzipora and Vekllei. It‚Äôs about her friends and her memories and all the good and bad parts of her life. It‚Äôs about what went down in America and how you can justify living. It‚Äôll have beautiful Vekllei landscapes and characters in muted colour. It will also include passages that act as a guide to Vekllei and society ‚Äî diagrams, infographics and footnotes. It‚Äôs also an escape from everything going on right now ‚Äî there‚Äôs good and bad in all stories, but at the end of the day Vekllei is a utopia.\nI will publish pages here for free. I‚Äôll collate them into chapters available exclusively to my patrons. Maybe some extra stuff too. I‚Äôm a good dad to my patrons. I already made a set of postcards and sent them out. Either way, you‚Äôll continue to see stuff here. This is exciting, isn‚Äôt it? This is a new chapter for me as an artist. It‚Äôs a vulnerable moment for me, because up until now it‚Äôs just sort of been ‚Äúposting on reddit‚Äù. I don‚Äôt have a publisher, I‚Äôm not trained, I‚Äôm just some guy. But this is what I‚Äôve always wanted to do, and I‚Äôm trying to get busy being born again.\nThere should be regular world posts here still. There‚Äôs drawings I like to do that just don‚Äôt fit into a comic format. I think during weekdays I‚Äôll work on the comic and on weekends I‚Äôll do a painting. We‚Äôll see how it goes.\nAlso, I‚Äôll have a nice big wiki soon with multiple language support. I‚Äôll let you know when it‚Äôs done.\nLet‚Äôs start this again, with all that off my chest.\nHi, I‚Äôm Hobart. I‚Äôm busy getting born again.\nMuch love,\nMelonKony\nJoin the Vekllei Patreon.\nJoin the Vekllei Discord.\nBe ‚Äúpetticoat‚Äù.\n All That‚Äôs Solid Melts into Zelda üìñ Published 18th October 2020 | Read here.\n My nerves are like overused sandpaper‚Äîall dull; only the eye-catching, bizarre and grotesque can excite me now.\n Tanizaki JunichiroÃÑ, 1918\nThe wind had died and it seemed that she would follow it. Crazy shadows distorted beneath car headlights. It occurred to her in some way that, as she approached dying, she was living out the ultimate dramatic fantasy of the American misplaced girl, in the same way the townsmen were fulfilling their grotesque constellation of death by murdering women. To them, she was not Zelda, or an agitator, or even a maid from Motel Grande; she was just a girl of girl-form, washed out; beat in; bent before the death-bridge where the creek rolled on below. It was brutal and violent, and also the most tacky thing. It scaled up and down, because it was murdering.\nThe hearts of America are like overused sandpaper ‚Äî all dull. This is how it played out in 2063, ages into the Great American Decline and well before it was put down like a sick dog by Chinese methods. The worn out bodies of the hedonistic coasts were numb to the spectacle of collapse and found themselves displaced and unfeeling, and so the neurotic motions of vampiric culture barons responded. In 2036, long before the Dallas Secession or Zelda‚Äôs birthday, the NBC under the Radio Corporation of America broadcast the first televised execution in the United States of child serial killer Wayne Graham. This enticed similar coverage across all major television networks for subsequent executions, which were viewed by millions of Americans. The format culminated in NBC‚Äôs The American Justice Show programme, in which the method and subject of broadcasted executions were made participatory by public poll. It was tremendously successful but was cancelled in 2041, after the botched death of George Kovacs.\nThis is not necrotic; this is neurotic; it is the ultimate sucking up of human desire into the commodity-form, and it was only the beginning. It is not just a poetic coincidence that the cancellation of American Justice saw the legalisation (or at the very least, decriminalisation) of prostitution in all regions but the Deep South over the next decade (which would contribute to the eventual secession). This is pleasure in its raw form, and the murder of prostituted immigrant-labourers and the eroticisation of the death of Wayne Graham‚Äôs teen-age victims was one and the same. The necroticisation would arrive later, as modernity tumoured and pleasure outpaced the sovereignty of the federal government.\nHere was Zelda, who was a perfect caricature of the real American in the 21st century ‚Äî born overseas, poor as shit, and dressed up for dying. And why shouldn‚Äôt she die? All the old things were dead. God, kings, outrage, empathy, optimism ‚Äî it was all thrown in the creek, with the rest of the immigrant-labourers. Why shouldn‚Äôt a child and her sensitivity be among them? You could change the channel on television and see pornography and the brutal violence of the Secession adjacent to each other. If you clicked the knob back and forth fast enough, they could become one and the same.\nTzipora was the last to arrive and among the first to be lynched, and maybe they would make postcards out of her dead body. She couldn‚Äôt even wonder this in her terror; the thought would only occur to her much later. It seemed like the whole Great American Decline, in all its hungry decomposition and hedonism was leading to this single moment ‚Äî and all that was once solid melts into Zelda.\n Petrol Heaven: The Rohsm STR-750 üìñ Published 13th October 2020 | Read here.\nThe Rohsm STR series is a small racer built for clubs by Rohsm S.p.M., a hundred-year-old company headquartered in the Mediterranean racing culture of Tohs. Its most recent variant, the 750, is available in limited quantities to enthusiast owners and club pools. Like most petrol cars in Vekllei, they are built by hand, so no two 750s drive exactly alike.\nCompared to its neighbouring continents, petrol cars are criminally unsafe in Vekllei, where a preference for speed and lightweight manoeuvrability in European bodies see much of the steel of electric autos traded for light alloys and carbon. They crumple like drink cans in a crash, but prior to their death the driver is having the best driving experience of his life. This reckless pursuit of good driving means locals call them ‚Äúbastard cars‚Äù. Extraordinarily lightweight and tremendously powerful, they cut sharp racing lines and trace corners. Poised and nimble, they make good use of Motorway One, the gentle curved ring road of Vekllei with no speed limit.\nBecause of the inconvenience of finding petrol stations and their relative danger, not many people drive petrol cars in Vekllei. Why would you, when it is usually faster and more convenient to take a fast tram or train, or a battery auto from an autopool? The ones that do drive, however, drive hard.\n Pictured is the 25th STR-750, returned home after wins on the circuit in Italy and Spain. Her drivers are pictured above. It also happens to be Tzipora‚Äôs favourite car, because it was the first petrol car she ever drove.\n  Mittens and Metaphysic: Product Atheism and Vekllei object-form üìñ Published 11th October 2020 | Read here.\n Pictured above: various fashions worn by Vekllei women, showcasing heavy cold-weather dresses, simple styling, strong geometric shapes and colours, loose fits, and modest hemlines.\n  Pictured below: postmodern neomarxism, which I‚Äôve tricked you into reading with anime.\n Previous posts on the Vekllei economy, if you‚Äôre new:\n Sundress Municipalism and how it works Macroeconomics and currency in a country with no money  Vekllei‚Äôs obvious contradictions are commonly referenced, but not always clear. Why are parts of Vekllei epistemology, or the ‚ÄòVekllei way of thinking,‚Äô contradictory? And if these are contradictions, then surely they must fall apart when they‚Äôre examined? How is it possible to hold two contradictory ideas at the same time and apply them? Let‚Äôs look at Product Atheism, Vekllei‚Äôs foundation for necroeconomics.\nAtismoprodarte, lit. ‚Äúproduct atheism,‚Äù is the process by which Vekllei culture breaks down and rebuilds social preconceptions of objects, including products. Vekllei does not really have commodities in the traditional idea of the word, so it is supplemented here by ‚Äòproduct,‚Äô which more closely resembles the Vekllei word for commodity-forms: prodart or prodatte. This concept is a part of Upen, which is found throughout Vekllei culture and its constitution, and coexists agnostically with organised religion.\n‚ÄúProduct Atheism‚Äù is the term for how Vekllei people think about the objects that make up their lives ‚Äî clothes, appliances, toys, trinkets and treasures. These things are not quite commodities, because they are not ‚Äúsold‚Äù. Vekllei does not use money, and so it does not produce items of any economic value.\nAn object‚Äôs economic form, then, is replaced by social form. Among Marxists, they call these social forms fetishistic, because products are given lives of their own and exist independently of the labour that created them. But this doesn‚Äôt work in Vekllei, because\n‚Ä¢ Labour-value is social, not economic. Vekllei people are not paid for work and they do not pay money for products. All work is for social reasons; all consumption is for social needs. Any object that is prohibited from the ordinary Vekllei person is merely landscape; it has no form.\n‚Ä¢ Labour-value is simultaneously suppressed, in imitation of commodity, and celebrated, in imitation of dereification. Vekllei shops look like any foreign shops, because they participate in the same fantasy ritual of shopping and allow easy access to products. At the same time, Upen emphasises the importance of local consumption and objects made by hand, and so Vekllei appliances are generally hand-made. This creates a social bond between the producer and consumer, and breaks down commodity-form, but it can‚Äôt escape the fetishised valuations encouraged by the consumer-fantasy. So it is neither a social or economic product while being both; resulting in a permanent contradiction.\nIn fact, Vekllei ‚ÄòProduct Atheism‚Äô is more or less a rejection of Marxist commodity fetishism, and instead advocates product-worship. This is because objects in Vekllei are regarded as fantasy, and are eroticised by a fantasy market. This is a symptom of the unspoken truth most foreigners are well aware of ‚Äî Vekllei does not have an economy; the Vekllei economy is dead; the economy has been reanimated and is zombified. No money changes hands, no product has value, and all products are abstracted and exclusively physical simultaneously.\nThus Product Atheism has two contradictions; first, that the participatory market economy of Vekllei is both alive and dead, making it both undead and unaliave, and second, that products are both abstracted by Product Atheism and then unabstracted through Product Atheism at the same time, leaving them formless and unconstructed ‚Äî and, per Upen‚Äôs definitions, truly personal and intimate.\nAcknowledging this necroeconomic construction destroys it, and so a final truth is revealed. In Vekllei, the exchange of objects is a social formality, like their uniforms and sign-language, and is both entirely superfluous and essential to the functioning of the state. This is not Marxism; this is not even economic; this is Vekllei, and its cultural forms are what determine all constructions of society. Vekllei‚Äôs ‚Äòmaterial form‚Äô is actually cultural, and Upen is its culture.\nSince Vekllei economic forms are not truly economic, it makes sense that Product Atheism does not merely apply to the economy. All products, or objects, are part of its frameworks. The example used in this picture, depicting women‚Äôs fashion, is a good example of how Upen brings together an abstract object value and a valueless physical object simultaneously. Clothes in Vekllei have a very powerful social function, enhanced by how colour and shape become forms of communication in themselves as part of Vekllei semaphore. Clothes are both figuratively and literally signifiers of personality and individual expression.\nIn Vekllei written script, called Topet, most traditional clothing items are each assigned a single character, giving them a transcendental pictographic quality, a feature impossible to replicate in phonetic speech. In this sense, the written description of a dress in Vekllei supersedes its spoken equivalent, privileging pictorial, transcendental imagery over literalism. This poetic form is part of product-worship, and thus part of Product Atheism. This means that, without even touching the sociological tastes and trends of clothing fashion in Vekllei, we can see Product Atheism smashing Western frameworks against their own assumptions, leaving much of Vekllei epistemology, even today, incomprehensible to ideology without Upen as its framework.\n Atlantic Boredom [07.10.2020] üìñ Published 7th October 2020 | Read here.\nFor a brief period of time, Zelda and Cobian took it upon themselves to make something of their youth. Cobian fancied herself a gymnast, and though this ambition arrived too late and left too soon, she was quite good at it for a while. Tzipora was better suited on the trampoline, where her stiff leg didn‚Äôt give her as much trouble.\nThey trained for about two hours, and after practice they met up to travel home together. Their gymnasium was in a coastal town called Gigayeh, in the borough of Mirah. Here, sloping lava fields were cast in the sea, buried under fine black sand.\nThere was an hour and a half after practice before the evening train arrived to take them back home to Lola, and so they were left with not much to do. Gigayeh had beautiful empty beaches, littered with icebergs that caught the light like jewels, but Tzipora couldn‚Äôt swim and the water was freezing. They could have enjoyed caf√© food in the sun, but Cobian‚Äôs regimented home life had left her incapable of eating outside of her designated meals, and Tzipora could only drink so much coffee. Instead, most of these afternoons, they found themselves sitting on the ocean promenade, watching a handful of locals go about their business as they counted the minutes.\nIn the moment, it was stupefyingly boring. They‚Äôd spent all day at school with each other and usually couldn‚Äôt conjure a word between them. Tzipora would make a remark about a seabird, because she liked them. She had been learning a lot about birds. Sometimes they would share a comic, but they read too fast to fill time. Most of it was spent in the sea air, feeling it grow colder as the day waned, watching the same ocean foam throw itself onto glittering volcanic sand.\n‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs a horned puffin. That‚Äôs special,‚Äù Tzipora said out loud. Cobian didn‚Äôt even look up. Tzipora squinted.\n‚ÄúNo, wait, that‚Äôs just a regular one.‚Äù\nIn time, Tzipora would remember this period of her life fondly, and would visit Gigayeh to recapture that peace. As a teen-ager, however, those afternoons seemed to last forever.\n VI. Gallery This month‚Äôs sketches, presented without context or or standards of quality.

November‚Äôs a bitch.\nThis was a hard month, evidenced in part by the smaller number of posts. Personal problems and some bad news are enough to derail plans, I‚Äôm afraid, and so other things had to take their place. November saw an increase in articles on MillMint.net and polish to the site, a whole lot of little sketches, as well as plans for a Patreon milestone reward and some private work on the comic.\nThe comic‚Äôs coming, by the way. I know it‚Äôs a little late and a little quiet, but it‚Äôs hard yakka and I‚Äôm doing my best. I‚Äôm writing this in early December, and I can tell you already that the winds are changing ‚Äî and man do I have a great month of stuff planned, including comic drafts and pins for Patrons.\nNovember saw two big ‚Äúarticle-type‚Äù posts about language and city planning ‚Äî sister articles on religion and nature will arrive in December. These posts help form the full-length wiki articles on the website, which will be comprehensive resources for understanding Vekllei. How exciting! Also expect a few more snapshots of life before the comic pages are released to Patrons in the coming weeks. As always, thanks for your patience, dear reader.\nFinally, if you would like to contribute to The Atlantic with writing, art or reviews relevant to the spirit of petticoat ideology, please contact Hobart at melonkony@icloud.com before the 30th of November.\nThank you for supporting Vekllei, and best wishes.\nHobart Phillips Enjoy ‚Äî Ê•Ω„Åó„Çì„Åß\n I. News \u0026amp; Announcements  Life can be hard sometimes. But it can also get better! I‚Äôm planning a full, complete site launch in the new year! It‚Äôll be a great wiki and archive of all content related to the project, and will really benefit my work overall. The comic will also be hosted via the site, though I‚Äôm still figuring out the particulars on that one. In November, I was interviewed by Media Tackle about Vekllei and utopian worldbuilding, and I look forward to sharing that interview with you all soon. My work on utopian worldbuilding in the films of Studio Ghibli will soon be hosted in the Essays section of the website. I love you.   II. Tzipora-watch In November of 2075, Tzipora would begin work as an amateur contributor to the underground ‚Äòzine Kid Comix, a satirical and often crude publication circulated mostly among its contributors and die-hard comix fans. This would get her in trouble more than once, especially after members of the Montre University faculty discovered her caricatures of them, but she would always look back on her time with the ‚Äòzine fondly. In many ways, it introduced her to publishing and would lead to her employ at the Montre University Tribune, where she would eventually serve as Editor-in-Chief.\n III. Vekllei Fact of the Month All fishing trawlers in Vekllei ‚Äî that is to say, fishing vessels above a certain size for large-scale commercial trawling ‚Äî are owned and operated by the navy. The seas in Vekllei‚Äôs exclusive economic zone are mostly fished by small craft laying lines and nets, but the deeper peripheral waters that surround the zone are as contentious as they are well-stocked with fish. To ensure the security of their trawlers and preserve access to these valuable and contested waters, trawlers are often guarded by navy ships ‚Äî a handful of trawlers are even equipped with guns!\n IV. WordBook Gouisvenpan ‚Äî pronounced ‚Äúgwee-ven-pan,‚Äù Gouisvenpan describes a state or territory that is divided between two political powers as a result of treaty or civil war. Tzipora‚Äôs middle-school-era homeland, the United States, is currently suffering from Gouisvenpan across many of its seceding states.\n V. The Bulletin Coming to Grips üìñ Published 30th November 2020 | Read here | Archived here\nShe would spend a long time by the rivulet that ran behind her apartment. She would do the housework and hang the wash out, then watch the water trickle past in the sun.\nShe tried to open a jar the other day and started to cry when she couldn‚Äôt get it open. She never cried once when she saw those things in America, or got beat to shit, but these days she cried over jam. She didn‚Äôt know what was going on. Things were getting worse.\nShe caught her reflection in the rivulet‚Äôs water. It provoked a nausea. She was so tired. What would stop her from plunging her face into the river until she slipped right in? Would she drown and float away, never to be seen again? Or maybe, in a miracle, she might grow gills and fins and swim away, her life-force put to better use as a fish or turtle.\nHow do you resolve an ache to confess sadness to someone and the instinct to protect your emotions? It wasn‚Äôt in her nature to tell people about her feelings. On some level, she looked down on it; every cell of her body told her to suffer in silence. She wore the same clothes every day. Why did she wear the same clothes every day?\nIt is a fierce thing to discover within yourself that which you despise the most. She watched the foam gather around a stick wedged in the bank of the rivulet. If she‚Äôd been born elsewhere, into power and wealth rather than girlishness and poverty, she would have made an excellent thug. She wondered how much management she needed. Why was it so hard to live?\nShe tasted the water from the rivulet and it was cold and sweet, and said a prayer to the rivulet for its purity no matter what happened to her. The wash was dry on the line.\n Out of The Ground and Into The Light üìñ Published 29th November 2020 | Read here | Archived here\n NO REALTORS EXCEPT THE STATE ‚ñ† THE COUNTY THE AGENT OF THE STATE ‚ñ† THE ARCHITECT THE AGENT OF THE COUNTY\n It is clear that in Vekllei democracy is a way of living more than it is a form of government. After all, by metrics of representation, the Atlantic nation\u0026rsquo;s electoral system often sputters and fails, undermined by the bundling of the human and natural votes as equal, and the wildly disproportionate borough system. But if democracy is a way of life and not just a ballot in its box, then we can see democracy acted out all around us in Vekllei.\nCities are living things; they are made up of people hurrying and talking and building. In cities, we see Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s centralised society/decentralised life contradiction lean towards \u0026ldquo;deurbanisation\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;local transparency\u0026rdquo;.\nThe four principles of Vekllei life are:\n Self-management and self-interest through Sundress Municipalism. Classification of property as an independent social organ, like nature. Abolishment of currency and currency-substitutes. Economic feminisation.  Ranked in order of their immediacy to the average person, we can see that Sundress Municipalism is at the core of Vekllei life. What exactly is Sundress Municipalism? It describes the organisation of Vekllei cities, which are arranged around the following principles:\n Local employment, or \u0026ldquo;commutelessness.\u0026rdquo; Slumlessness, beautification, and a will to architecture. Property stewardship. Open air and clean water. Land usefulness (\u0026quot;friendliness\u0026quot;). Private ownership of private needs. Public ownership of public needs.  These values are oriented around a deeply Vekllei valuation of space, and the accessibility of place and material to ordinary people. They also reveal some peculiarities in their listing \u0026ndash; what constitutes a private and public need, and what constitutes ownership, are deeply spiritual concepts in Vekllei, and their use here relies on uncoded intuition. Let us not forget we are dealing with a state that considers itself to be the human ambassador of the ground on which it sits, and so \u0026ldquo;public\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;private\u0026rdquo; include the nonhuman in their metrics. This is how, much to the amusement of foreigners, buildings can and often do \u0026ldquo;own themselves\u0026rdquo; in Vekllei. Most ownership is proved by stewardship; the use of space. The person who works the shop and lives above it, owns the shop.\nThis image depicts the Vekllei city of Adouisneh, the florid culture capital of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Northwest. It is one of the \u0026ldquo;Five Crowning Cities\u0026rdquo; of Vekllei, measured by population and cultural significance, and was the site of one of the earliest parliaments in the world, centuries before the monarchy would come to power. You can see here the tension between old-world European planning and new-world Sundress Municipalism in the architecture and layout of this city.\n A cactus bloom is beyond any bloom, I think, manufactured by plants anywhere in the world. And there you have an interesting syllogism, haven‚Äôt you? The desperate nature of the armed plant and the exquisite, beautiful efflorescence it produces. Something to think about. There you see, revealed, some processes of nature, the significance of which I don‚Äôt gather at the moment.\n \u0026ndash; Frank Lloyd Wright, Nov. 1952\nPerhaps urbanised modernity is the cactus, and Sundress Municipalism is the blossom.\nIt is not that Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s feminised Municipalism represents a clean departure from how cities look and feel, but instead constitutes a rethinking of urbanism; it is an ideology of homesteads, decentralisation, clean air, food production, arts and crafts, leisure, and the spirit, if not the literal presence of, \u0026ldquo;disposable income.\u0026rdquo; It is not enough that a factory should be the property of the people who work in it; a factory should become adjacent to the home, a part of it, designed in ways that benefit the good instincts of ordinary people. Vekllei is a celebration of the architect; automatons may now do a lot of the work, but all design is deeply human.\nThis is the heart of the dream. Vekllei is not a big enough country to gift each person an acre of land to do with as they wish; it is, however, sophisticated enough to decentralise that \u0026ldquo;local acre\u0026rdquo; among the community, cultivating those same values in a modern skyline and allowing the city to flow across the landscape, changing as it responds to the place around it. Ownership is important; stewardship is especially important. By allowing people to own and use land, you give them dignity. Above all, design and architecture are important for the same reason spatiality is important \u0026ndash; they give presence to and emulsify work and leisure.\n After the mid-twentieth century, modernism began to encircle the world and the architectural and urban images once projected as utopian began to fill real space. In the 1960s this reached a saturation point; utopia was, ironically, realised.\n \u0026ndash; Karatani Kojin, Architecture as Metaphor, 1983\nThis occurred because, upon realising that art must be removed from architecture in order to safeguard it against a looming \u0026ldquo;loss of subject,\u0026rdquo; avant-garde thinkers methodologically reestablished architecture as \u0026lsquo;construction\u0026rsquo; \u0026ndash; utilitarian efforts towards grand ideas. With art removed, architecture was able to close in on the inherent placelessness of utopia. In Vekllei, this approach is extant (though diminished by their absurd place-metaphysics) through Newda, the indigenous design ideology that continues to service architecture through social, rather than artistic, methods.\nThe \u0026ldquo;big idea\u0026rdquo; Newda is an agent for, wrapped up in Sundress Municipalism, is very straightforward:\n The city should be everywhere and nowhere.\n In Adouisneh, despite its thousand years of history, we can see postwar Newda come to life in its integration and decentralisation of the \u0026ldquo;city\u0026rdquo; as a living process, moving people and their concerns closer together. Developed only with the consent of the architect, Vekllei has become an architocracy, serving decentralised, pleasant living through bureau monopolies.\nPerhaps, after all, it is the necessity of state authority that is the cactus, and the middle-class free lifestyles of Vekllei people that make up the blossom.\n How to Speak Vekllei, and A New Website üéä üìñ Published 15th November 2020 | Read here | Archived here\nFor all you\u0026rsquo;ve seen of Vekllei and her characters, you\u0026rsquo;ve never heard a single one of them speak. This post marks a little exploration into the Vekllei language, and a \u0026lsquo;soft launch\u0026rsquo; of my website, https://millmint.net. The proper launch will come at the end of the month.\nThis post will briefly discuss some elements shown in this infographic, but a large article on the language has been drafted here. If you have some interest in constructed language, and some of the more playful aspects of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s evolving utopian communication systems, I encourage you to take a look at it. The website is incomplete, and both the articles on characters and Vekllei itself are very incomplete. Otherwise, a growing archive, essays, and issues of the Atlantic Bulletin are all available. Have a poke around, and let me know if anything breaks! The site has dark mode, if you\u0026rsquo;re a gamer. Just click the moon.\nOne Language, Many Parts To borrow from the article linked above, the Vekllei language has six core systems often referred to as sublanguages. They are as follows:\n Spoken Vekllei, which is everyday spoken language. It draws from two glossaries with different meanings and feelings, called Oa and Loh. Topet, which are logographic characters (occasionally characterised as hieroglyphs). Like other pictographic languages, Topet characters can be broken down into repeating components, called Topotte. Rapotenne, is the traditional logographic language of names. It is much older than Topet, and has more in common with spiritual runes than modern logography. Potenne, lit. ‚ÄúHand-Talk‚Äù, is a sign language that incorporates gestures and signing to add meaning to emotion to spoken language, and occasionally in place of it. Upotenne, lit. ‚ÄúSpirit-Hand-Talk‚Äù, as the recreation of runes in human form, used limitedly in spiritual ritual. Vekllei Semaphore is the codification of colour and shape. Traditionally limited to colour, shape and pattern are now also included in Vekllei Semaphore, in which full sentences can be formed.  In This Picture We can see various parts of the Vekllei sublanguages on display, including Topet, Rapotenne, Potenne and Vekllei Semaphore. Before Cobian gets close enough to say hello, Tzipora has already delivered a devastating compliment via a simple three-finger tap to the palm, admiring how she looks. A couple of descriptions of Tzipora written in Topet have been annotated on her left, to demonstrate its use, including a tongue-twister (\u0026ldquo;She always tucks her shirt\u0026rdquo; becomes \u0026ldquo;Louisn Laismoh Loah Liousmineh\u0026rdquo;). You\u0026rsquo;ll notice Topet looks especially hieroglyphic, even by pictographic standards.\nTzipora\u0026rsquo;s full Blood Name is spelled out in Rapotenne below, which is markedly different from Topet in history, characters and grammar. Most formal names in Vekllei employ a seal in place of writing it out in full ornamentation, which has been provided below along with a formal signature. Her signature is entirely pictographic; elements are arranged according to symbolic value, rather than phonological legibility.\nOn the right, we can see an example of how Semaphore lives up to its name through its presence on flags, reinforcing and communicating information without conventional literacy. Also shown are a handful of basic symbols as they relate to authority, with the landscape of Vekllei superseding all human organs. Their colours matter, and so their meanings are more complex than what is described here \u0026ndash; for example, a small black circle refers to a human being, but an orange one refers to an arctic person (usually Vekllei).\nFinally, we have a breakdown of the word comiya (also looked at here), which means \u0026ldquo;friend.\u0026rdquo; Tzipora and Cobian are comiya, and Moise and Cobian are\u0026hellip; sort of comiya. The introduction here of phonetic complements, which are duplicate consonant-pairs used to slightly alter the semantic meaning of a word without changing its pronunciation, allows the idea of a \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; to be conceptualised in many different ways, to encompass all sorts of relationships. This one here implies a sort of na√Øve love (by using characters for late autumn, young woman and a glacial beach, all pronounced /k/.)\nLimpettes are tails that underline vowel-forms called hieyerette to enhance legibility. Although ornamented Topet has visually distinct consonant-pairings, business Topet does not generally use superscript and so limpettes designate the vowel-form. If you\u0026rsquo;re a bit lost, that\u0026rsquo;s okay. It\u0026rsquo;s in the main article, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to make this post too long.\nYou can imagine then, even with only a handful of examples of language in practice here, how complex Vekllei can become as phonological and semantic meaning compound, combine and seperate in different forms and contexts. The spoken word can be altered by the physical gesture, and the physical gesture can be altered by the written word.\nThat about wraps up this brief analysis of the infographic above. Thanks for reading, and please let me know here if you have any questions.\n Thanks for your patience this month, it\u0026rsquo;s been slow and hard. With the first pages of the comic around the corner and the site launching at the end of the month, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot to look forward to. Cheers.\n  21st Century Witch üìñ Published 9th November 2020 | Read here | Archived here\nWhen the light shifted just right, the ceramic tiles and concrete footpaths twinkled like water off the back of a swan. 16th Century witches could build a hut in the woods and forage for herbs; 21st Century witches were susceptible to modernist persuasions.\nThe Demotic Meeting Hall was constructed twenty years prior as the main meeting hall of the National Dockworker‚Äôs Union. Situated on the coast, and along the recently-built monorail line to Roya, it dominated the coastline like a mythic lighthouse. Where the cathedrals of Europe built spires to God, Vekllei built towers for dockmen. At 112 meters tall, the hall‚Äôs colossal window structures were awesome within, and its massive bronze ornament glittered for miles. It was palatial.\nThe Dockworker‚Äôs Union moved west to Montre at some point, so these days it was simply the Roya Demotic Community Hall. It was used for all sorts of things, not least of which domestic tourism. Its lookout provided views across the North-West Fjords. When Tzipora first arrived in Vekllei, the scale and decadence of it appealed to her enormously. It was depicted on her language booklet, and since then she‚Äôd developed a minor fascination with the structure.\nShe got her chance to visit upon her invitation to a costume party hosted by the Chef‚Äôs Concern. Tzipora is a witchy sort of person, and the idea of going as a witch appealed to her. She already had the wardrobe ‚Äî as Cobian remarked:\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôve put on a hat and you‚Äôre holding a stick ‚Äî that‚Äôs it.‚Äù\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my costume,‚Äù Zelda said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a witch.‚Äù\nYou can see her here attempting to recreate the sumptuous curve of the Meeting Hall in witch form.\nMore posts soon.\n VI.

Yes, it‚Äôs painfully self-concerned and a little difficult to read back, but for newcomers to the project you might find some ‚Äúobvious truths‚Äù about Vekllei you have not yet encountered.  I did not come to Tokyo to find a reference for the Petticoat Project, because utopia does not exist there for me. In fact, by nearly every Vekllei metric, Tokyo is positively dystopian ‚Äî a consumer paradise of the crushing, isolating modernity Vekllei is supposed to escape. And yet, marks of this city (and this country) are prevalent through Vekllei as a constructed country and my aesthetic as a writer and an artist. I can‚Äôt bring myself to love all of Japanese society, but I do love the country and its people. This intersection between traditional utopian world-building (along the lines of News from Nowhere or even the original Utopia) and the emotional, linear fragments of utopian storytelling which realise the cold encyclopaedia of a utopian world were the focus of my expedition to Japan. The premise of Vekllei society is at odds with so much of Japanese society ‚Äî yet the emotional, aesthetic culture of the country (what I call the ‚Äòcharacter‚Äô of utopianism) has influenced my media creation tremendously.\nAs a supplementary preface, I would like to note that it would be terrible of me to dismiss Japan as an oriental wonder of salarymen and neo-Zaibatsu. That approach has more in common with Frank Capra‚Äôs wartime propaganda piece Know Your Enemy: Japan than it does with real structural criticism. It is all too easy to dismiss the social and economic conditions of the country today as the natural inclination of a Japanese caricature ‚Äî a homogenous hive-mind of enormously productive and obedient people. This is of course a terrible attack on the proud and long-standing tradition of dissent and progressiveness in the country ‚Äî which is also home to one of the world‚Äôs largest opposition communist parties. It is a country of student mobilisation, protests and intense factionalism between the left and right-wing radicals1. It is important not to conflate the impersonal structures of a society with the orientalist idea of cultural predisposition.\nA love of Studio Ghibli films and a desire for material and emotional escapism is what drives my utopian world-building. Where co-founder Isao Takahata had a penchant for artful emotional realism and domestic drama, Hayao Miyazaki has found tremendous success in Japan and abroad with his fantastical stories rich with nostalgia and warmth. They have obvious recurring themes ‚Äî childhood, environmentalism, aircraft, etc., but it is no real secret (at least to media critics and Ghibli superfans) that these overt recurrences are symptomatic of more serious and grounded beliefs. In a fantastic analysis of My Neighbour Totoro, Phillip E. Wegner makes use of Kojin Karatani‚Äôs works (another great influence of mine) to illustrate Miyazaki‚Äôs uniquely Japanese pre-Meiji cross-generational nostalgia evident in the film.\n What Miyazaki presents us with in My Neighbor Totoro is a vision in which the classic \u0026ldquo;what if\u0026rdquo; question of the genre has been proposed: that is, what if the Meiji revolution did not happen? Moreover, since it is the dramatic and rapid modernization of the Meiji period that gives rise to the virulent imperialist nationalism and militarism that ultimately results in the Second World War, Miyazaki also offers in his film us a glimpse of a Japan in which the catastrophe of World War II did not occur2.\n Japan‚Äôs spectre of modernity is a recurring character in many of Miyazaki‚Äôs films, just as the villain of war revives itself time and time again ‚Äî from the steel production of Iron Town in Princess Mononoke to the death of the golden age of aviation in The Wind Rises. Karatani‚Äôs landmark work, Origins of Japanese Literature, makes clear that basic premises of modern society ‚Äî from children to history to nature ‚Äî are not immutable items atomised by scientific fact, but instead products of modern society that have not always existed3 pp.12-44, 113-135. Vekllei reflects this concept, at least superficially ‚Äî children are represented as independent agents desegregated from modern age-based schooling, nature is regarded as a fellow social organ, and work is largely self-satisfying and decommodified. These are things that are important to me and it makes sense enough that Vekllei reflects that.\nSimilarly, even supposedly less political Ghibli films like Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service carry powerful images of the ‚Äòspectre of modernity‚Äô. Regarding the climax of the film in which a zeppelin soars hopelessly out of control over a city, A.J. Rocca hauntingly writes:\n [We] find that this is not truly a witch‚Äôs story, but a ghost story. The ghost died in a fire on 6 May 1937, foreshadowing the fires of a war that would change the world forever. The ghost is called the Spirit of Freedom in the film, but its true name is LZ 129 Hindenburg, and it‚Äôs not the spirit of freedom but the ghost of modernity.4\n So the material manifestation of Japanese society for me‚Äî despite all the glory of her bright packaging and dense infrastructure ‚Äî is an aesthetic and satirical media culture that saturates the Petticoat Project. Vekllei is a \u0026lsquo;poor man‚Äôs Utopia\u0026rsquo;, inspired in part by my superficial understanding of a ‚Äòpoor man‚Äôs Japan'. Vekllei, like media representations of postwar Sh≈çwa Japan, has a shadow of pacifism and shame about it (that idea that \u0026lsquo;all politics is sexual pathology‚Äô occurs to me). These are deliberate aesthetic choices that reflect not landscape utopianism but character utopianism ‚Äî the real colour of a constructed world that acts out the structure of mean ideology and culture-constructs. These ill-defined images of utopian society, and a rejection of landscape world-building, are excellent vehicles for utopian writing. After all, it is sustained engagement with utopia that betrays the totality of it5. What fascinates me particularly about Miyazaki‚Äôs unique utopian instincts is his recurring premise is essentially nostalgic and escapist ‚Äî the aesthetic of a Miyazaki film is almost always midcentury or earlier, illustrating a time before Japan‚Äôs ‚Äòmodern century‚Äô. This is in stark contrast to the saccharine optimism of utopian socialists like Morris, Chernyshevsky, and Bellemy, telling stories of a future yet to come.\nAnd that is to say nothing of the aesthetic qualities of a Japanese city! Tokyo is a wonderful glimpse of a retro-future as imagined by the 1980s ‚Äî as though the economic crisis of the 1990s has since suspended time. Japan is clean and modern, but also retrofuturistic. The lifeblood of the city is in rebar and concrete as infrastructure. The people on the street are dressed in conservative items that go without the prudish connotations of similar Western fashion. Working men and women are suited traditionally, many with waistcoats. Such is the visual language of modern Japan. Young men sport tech-wear or innovative types of street-wear dominated by colour and comfort. General women‚Äôs fashion leans heavily on items popularly discarded in Western markets, at least until recently. Pleat or patterned skirts, blouses, cardigans, hosiery and socks, loafers and brogues, etc. are very common and provide a wonderful anecdotal rebuff to the outrageous images of ‚ÄòHarajuku girls‚Äô and Lolita style that epitomise some ideas of Japanese fashion. The famous ‚Äòsailor uniform‚Äô has been largely phased out of junior and senior high schooling, replaced with Western-style blazers and ties. Tokyo is not ‚Äòbehind‚Äô the rest of the world; that is not what it means to be retrofuturistic. In my eyes, it has disembarked from Western technological and fashion attitudes some time ago and has since progressed on its own collective cultural intuition, and has subsequently spent the last few decades exporting media, fashion and culture into the West. It‚Äôs a great thing to see in person, at the heart of it all.\nDespite my qualms with modern Japanese consumer society, Vekllei is perched on a romanticised and fictitious Japanese aesthetic, and the country is enormously influential on the way I go about world-construction. With one sentence I will denounce the complexity of Japanese honorific language systems and in the other fawn over the mixed agricultural-residential suburbs that make up so much of the land outside of Tokyo‚Äôs city limits. Koka parks were inspired by these displays of community food production. The Vekllei Constabulary were created after research and experience with the Japanese Police Box system. Vekllei‚Äôs knotted network of trains and streetcars are reminiscent of Tokyo and Hiroshima. For all my public rejection of modern consumer society, and my begrudging participation in it, the Japanese qualities of Vekllei are valuable and are utopian in their own right ‚Äî and so Tokyo remains one of the most important inspirations of Petticoat Society in the world.\nSo what of that dichotomy? Of deep ideological incongruities with Japanese consumer society, but an embarrassing affection for the mythological post-war aesthetic and Japanese culture? The truth of it is that Vekllei is first and foremost a collection of stories, and stories are the domain of the emotional. Wonderful, vague images of utopia ‚Äî like washing corn in My Neighbour Totoro or an all-night writing session in Whisper of the Heart. My time in Tokyo introduced me to a wealth of these nostalgic feelings ‚Äî of curiosity in a cauldron of social atomisation. Life in Tokyo is not without problems, and it is certainly not my perfect idea of utopia, but the intersection of the culture and promise of Japanese society, either in the past as alt-history or in the future as science fiction, has me coming back time and time again to better realise my own projects of utopia.

Update for Patrons -mail  EDITOR  Letters ‚ùñ This letter was sent out to Patrons in November 2020  Hello my lovelies,\nJust a short update on where I‚Äôm at as we pass mid-month. I‚Äôve pushed a couple of things back a day or two to finish a very cool/special post. You‚Äôll see it on the reddit soon ‚Äî it‚Äôll be a really nice painting, and nothing like I‚Äôve ever done before. Before the weekend.\nI was hesitant to promise a timeframe for the comic draft, and for good reason. I haven‚Äôt done anything like this before, so I don‚Äôt have a reference for how much work and time these things take. I‚Äôve had three years now to narrow down and figure out what sort of schedule works for posts via reddit, and I‚Äôve got a big of an adjustment period here. I‚Äôm hoping to have the draft up for patrons here soon, within a week. In future, I think a chapter a month is perfectly feasible, but there‚Äôs a lot to learn ‚Äî formats, comic stylisation, and even black and white illustration are pretty new to me. So stay tuned for the draft.\nThe stamps are coming along well! I‚Äôve had to redraw the post office post since the original didn‚Äôt really work out, and that will be out before the end of the month. Little sketches and hopefully another post or two are also mapped out between here and then.\nFinally, since we‚Äôve hit $100/month on Patreon, that means we can start talking about a fun reward. Previously, I reached out to a print company, tabulated how much it would cost per unit, then simply subtracted your lifetime donation to the project from your order. The Tzipo-stcards cost around $20 to print and ship, so anyone who had donated a total of $20 over their Patreon pledge would get them for ‚Äúfree‚Äù. The same system will work here. Any patron is entitled to one ‚Äî if your total pledges are under the cost of manufacture, you can simply make up the difference. You won\u0026rsquo;t miss out if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to.\nI‚Äôm currently looking into little enamel pins, since I love pins, but I‚Äôll have a poll up within the next week to see if you‚Äôd prefer any alternatives.\nAs always, sincere thanks for your patronage. It means a lot.\nLove\nMelon\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/newsdesk/patreon/letters/2020/nov/","title":"Letter | November 2020"},{"content":"A Quiet July -mail  EDITOR  Letters ‚ùñ This letter was sent out to Patrons in July 2021  Hello beloved patrons,\nJust checking in after a quiet July.

Update for Patrons -mail  EDITOR  Letters ‚ùñ This letter was sent out to Patrons in December 2020  Hello beloved patrons,\nThis is your monthly update for the Petticoat Project.\nThere‚Äôs a new post up on the subreddit and a new article up on the website ‚Äî a big one, about Vekllei, although it‚Äôs missing a history and culture section. Those are coming soon.\nI won‚Äôt be mucking around on the website forever ‚Äî trust me, I have no intention of abandoning my traditional post format for dry wiki articles ‚Äî but it makes good infrastructure, and good infrastructure allows for growth and it also helps support new projects, like the comic. The website and its articles will launch over the New Year.\nGuess what else is launching over the new year? The comic. You‚Äôll see it before that, of course, as I‚Äôm sketching the remaining pages now. But I hope to have it ready and inked by early January. Does it keep getting delayed? Yes. But that‚Äôs the unglamorous thing about infrastructure ‚Äî it‚Äôs just work, and it‚Äôs not that visible. Hopefully regular posts fill the ache in the meantime.\nYou can see a page I‚Äôve inked here! This was a sort of test of style, and needs a bit of tweaking. Overall, I\u0026rsquo;ve ascertained that I like screen tones.\nI am very excited for Patreon milestone merch (in the form of beautiful little enamel pins), and will release a poll concerning designs in the coming days. I‚Äôll also have a price-point ‚Äî like last time, your lifetime pledge is deducted from the cost + shipping, and any difference can be made up easily. So no one will miss out who doesn‚Äôt want to.\nLast of which, I‚Äôd like to wish the observers among us a very Merry Christmas and to everyone else a Happy New Year. Stay tuned for a special issue of The Atlantic Bulletin to celebrate 2021.\nYour support is very important to me and is always deeply humbling.\nMan, I can‚Äôt wait for this comic.\nLove\nMelon\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/newsdesk/patreon/letters/2020/dec/","title":"Letter | December 2020"},{"content":"Feb.

I‚Äôve called this meeting late because I‚Äôve been working late. Let‚Äôs run this through quick, and we can all get back to bed.\n You guys voted! Looks like our next themed ‚Äòweek‚Äô (maybe fortnight) is Ocean Week. Great choice, lots of cool concepts coming. Mail Week (fortnight) has been a lot of fun, but it‚Äôs almost done. I‚Äôve got one post left in it, maybe two depending on how this painting works out. Then we‚Äôre done for the month. Ocean Week starts in March. There‚Äôs a new article on the site about the mail in Vekllei: https://millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/society/mail/. I‚Äôm going to write one of these for each themed week. It might seem silly to write a whole article about the mail considering more important areas desperately need attention, but as we do more of these themed weeks it‚Äôll fill out the site nicely. These articles aren‚Äôt just posts copied and pasted into a long doc; they‚Äôre all original content, and link to posts from that week. Check it out! What comes next? Well, for the rest of this month I‚Äôll be getting the next chapter of the comic out and I‚Äôll have one or two regular posts too. Thanks for the patience with the comic; I‚Äôve been doing some experimenting and I‚Äôve got a great ‚Äúfirst chapter‚Äù coming up. Merch? Working on it. Pins are a fantastic idea, but very expensive at this scale (we‚Äôre talking about $500 minimum or so, and I don‚Äôt really want to run a store right now!). So I‚Äôll have a poll here soon to figure out what you‚Äôd like to see ‚Äî postcard sets are cheap and fun, but why not tee shirts or other bric a brac? The Atlantic Bulletin? I got swamped with work, and it was a real pain to format for email. But it‚Äôs not dead. I‚Äôm going to relaunch it as a ‚Äúwhenever I can‚Äù periodical with better stuff and original content, rather than just a list of posts of each month. I‚Äôll be looking for contributions too, I‚Äôll let you know when I do.  That‚Äôs about it, nice and quick.\nThank you always for your continued support.

You will see it on Monday (about two days from this message). It won\u0026rsquo;t be inked but it\u0026rsquo;ll give you a very good idea of what the final chapter will look like at the end of the month. I look forward to reading your feedback, since it\u0026rsquo;s my first try at this sort of thing (well, minus the dozens of concepts trashed over the previous few months).\nThank you dearly for your patience. It was a source of some trouble for me as I figured out how to put these people and this environment to paper for the first time. It\u0026rsquo;s come out great \u0026ndash; I hope you\u0026rsquo;ll enjoy it. It took a long time but it\u0026rsquo;s finally starting. This will be a monthly thing.\nIn the first chapter you will see trains, planes and automobiles and some great landscapes too.\nIn other news, the archive on millmint.net is finally finished. This is a complete collection of all Vekllei posts I have ever posted to reddit, going way back to 2017. Each post had to be painstakingly copied to the site, and it took days. Over 200 posts and pictures. At least it\u0026rsquo;s done. Let us never speak of it again.\nPencil in Monday on your calendars. How exciting.\nThank you always for your continued support.

All things have some life to them, but spirits are something special. Up in Tiyousn, seispri (lit. spirits) wander freely, attracted by sulphur and silica waste pools discharged by the Magma-Electric Flash Plant nearby. Rich with minerals and warm to the touch, these milky ponds are gathering places for creatures of the spirit world.\nVekllei people do not understand spirits; they will never understand spirits. The word itself is nearly meaningless, applied broadly to any creature crossing over from unseen spatial cages. The only thing that characterises a spirit is its human intelligence and, by association, their complicated personalities. Most appreciate gestures, even misplaced ones, so it never hurts to leave offerings and announce your intentions in Vekllei‚Äôs autonomous Crown Lands.\nTzipora was outside of Equetti, in Tiyousn, looking for mineral pools that were the right temperature to bathe in. Finding a favourite mineral pool was a right of passage in Vekllei, and locations to good ones were often secrets given only to close friends and family.\nShe was about two kilometres south of the Flash Plant when she saw it and screamed.\nSpirits always provoke raw terror the first time. They are not of nature; they are like humans. Their intelligence distinguishes them from the physicality of their surrounds and complicates their behaviour with cultural constructions. It is not like seeing an animal. It is like seeing beyond the horizon of death and the things that live beyond it.\nTzipora was now looking at herself, dressed in some approximation of the things she wore. She thought it was here to kill her. Shaking, and stupidly, she spoke to it like a reflection in a mirror: ‚ÄúYou scared me.‚Äù\nAt first she thought it might be a demon ‚Äî a creature that hurt people. But it ‚Äî Tzipora did not know what else to call it ‚Äî sat facing herself, staring unblinkingly. Demons didn‚Äôt sit; they beat you to death.\nTzipora had been doing a lot of reading about spirits, but had no real reference for this apparition. It would be a terrible thing to run away ‚Äî she‚Äôd probably offend the spirit, and it was bad manners anyway. She did not know what to do, so Tzipora said hello and introduced herself, and then said something nice about the weather. She spoke slowly, carefully. The spirit sat there, looking at her.\nTzipora asked about the mineral ponds, and if there were good springs to bathe in, but the spirit said nothing. It looked as real as herself ‚Äî the lichen on the rock was disturbed beneath the spirit‚Äôs skirt. Her skirt, actually ‚Äî was the spirit pulling its outfit from Tzipora‚Äôs mind? Could it sense thoughts? She kept talking politely, about how nice the walk out here was. She paused for a moment and worked up the courage for a compliment, then told the spirit she liked its clothes. She was worried it might provoke a response, but the spirit stayed still.\nHer heart was pounding, but Tzipora could suppress fear. She opened her pack and pulled out her lunch, spreading it out next to the mineral pool before them. She had a bar of Gosmo milk chocolate. She asked if the spirit would like some. She unwrapped the foil, looking at it, and broke off a row of squares. She put two squares in her own mouth, and took the other two squares and held it out. The spirit didn‚Äôt move. Moving slowly, Tzipora reached over gently and placed the chocolate on its arm. As she did so, her fingertip brushed its arm ‚Äî her own arm ‚Äî and she was filled with unease. It was as real as she was; its arm was warm to the touch.\nTzipora had stopped chewing her chocolate. It melted on her tongue. In the back of her mind she thought about getting a cavity. A moment later, the spirit and the chocolate disappeared. It just stopped being there. Tzipora looked around, afraid it might be sneaking up on her, but it was gone.\nShe broke off two more squares, packed her sandwich back into her pack and walked briskly back to Equetti. As she passed by the ponds, her fear eased ‚Äî there was some abstract sense, perhaps, that she had been invited here. Maybe spirits liked chocolate.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-09-11-spirit/","title":"Tzipora Meets a Spirit"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Baron had been working in the twilight of violence for over twenty years. In that time he had not given much thought to children or family, except for those that lingered as ghosts from long ago. Despite popular misconception, Baron did on occasion daydream, and in those daydreams was an abstract picture of his heir ‚Äî a dark-haired son not unlike himself.\nTzipora was not a son but she was not unlike him. She gave him a new perspective on life ‚Äî a reason for going on, and a universe outside of service to the state. And how she adored him. She demonstrated that in how she talked, and how she childishly defended any casual observation or guessing of him. They were old friends ‚Äî war buddies, in fact ‚Äî and spent many evenings talking about the world and the things in it. Yet a paternal dimension of their relationship existed. Tzipora was young and full of questions, and wanted desperately to be taught. So he guided her when she asked for it, and answered her questions. And there were so many questions.\nIn his daydreams he taught his son to use the gun. There were guns in the home but Tzipora was not allowed to touch them, because she had been prescribed antipsychotics fourteen months into her life in Vekllei. She didn‚Äôt end up needing the pills; they only gave her tremors. It wasn‚Äôt until she was diagnosed properly at eighteen years of age that she as allowed to use the guns with Baron.\nThey went hunting for meat, since there had been more shortages that year, and in summer Vekllei is full of a most obscure pest called a Pademelon ‚Äî a type of Australian wallaby that had been introduced just prior to the War by accident. Now they were all over, inoffensive as they were. The meat was tasty and the government encouraged you to cull them, so they were hunted commonly. Tzipora had some knowledge of how to use a pistol but hadn‚Äôt fired a long gun. Baron showed her how to use the sites and hold it. She didn‚Äôt kill anything, but Baron bagged two. Tzipora figured out how to skin and clean the animal and they ate wallaby steaks that night, which tasted good but were gamey. She shared the rest of the meat with a neighbour who had helped her repair the boiler.\nIn the echoes of Baron‚Äôs memory was a distant, youthful dream of riding a motorbike overseas, maybe across Asia or through the Middle East. Eating from street vendors and sleeping wherever you could. Was it so crazy? After twenty years of work he had plenty of money to withdraw for travel. He wondered if Tzipora would like to learn to ride a motorbike ‚Äî and what she‚Äôd think of such an idea.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-08-25-gun/","title":"The Gun"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Children of the children of the bomb ‚Äî a generation of war-babies born in peacetime. That was how they thought of themselves. Their grandparents and great-grandparents had lived through the war and the occupation, and so they had inherited the burden of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s future as a country of long-sufferers, visionaries, and dispossessed.\nSome Marxist continental intellectual had said something a half-century ago about the right way to teach children, and the idea had probably caught the ear of some commissar of the Vekllei interim government, who perhaps passed it along to some bureaucrat rebuilding the government schools. As a result, Vekllei children only go to school three or four days a week. There, they spend only a few hours a day in classrooms. There is, after all, no real workforce for which they are being primed. Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s labour economy is a play-fantasy, and so they mostly learn how to play.\nIt is not designed to \u0026lsquo;free\u0026rsquo; children ‚Äî Vekllei schools have hierarchies, punishments and are mandatory \u0026mdash; instead, the primary goal of education is self-discovery and self-respect. It is precisely these qualities that benefit most the modern Vekllei economy, which is heavily automated and competes internationally through the product of its participatory creative thinking.\nThere is no grading system in Vekllei ‚Äî all classes are passed or failed. The value of compulsory education through government schools, then, is the socialisation of boys and girls with others boys and girls, and the availability of equipment and facilities to participate in extracurricular activities. This is the real body of Vekllei school life ‚Äî its clubs, societies, and individual associations. Many professional photographers in this country discovered an affection for photography before they turned 15 years old, through exposure to it in school. These resources, and the need to socialise children with others, are the reasons the Vekllei government continues to universalise government schooling, even alongside home-schooling or independent/religious education.\nDepicted here are the good-natured youth of the new generation in school uniform ‚Äî a topic we\u0026rsquo;ve visited before. All students in Vekllei wear the same uniform, including at university. The uniforms themselves are not designed specifically to regulate appearance ‚Äî and to this end, schools do not have dress codes regarding hair or cultural/religious accessories including jewellery.\nDiscard any assumptions about the meaning behind the colour or style of their clothes ‚Äî all variations depicted here can be worn by whomever, no matter their age, school or association. In fact, school uniforms are not provided directly by schools ‚Äî they are found at department stores, on the rack alongside suits and dresses. Because of this fact, specific styles of shirt, trousers, socks and shoes vary between students ‚Äî and are acceptable as long as they meet the basic requirements of the uniform. This intersection of control and anarchy can be found widely throughout broader Vekllei society, and is an interesting example of how the basic principles of the \u0026ldquo;Vekllei way of life\u0026rdquo; are reflected in the microscopic mundanities of life and foundations of national culture simultaneously.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-08-21-generation/","title":"A New Generation"},{"content":"","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/categories/landscape/","title":"landscape"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  000\nCDCDCD DW001 VK\nHEAR THIS ‚Äî THIS IS CIVIL DEFENCE ‚Äî THIS IS NOT AN EXERCISE.

It had an effect on the air; on the grass. Tzipora was very good at admiring the mundane, and the spaces it inhabited.\nLandscape is all around us, all of the time. It does not just occur in scenery, or in nature. And it can be very difficult to see landscape for what it is, because our interiors \u0026mdash; our selves \u0026mdash; announce themselves constantly. In order to enjoy the quiet physicality of everyday life, you have to quiet that voice. What is left is the senses, and intuition.\nVekllei was full of these sensory feelings, because it was full of physical things. It was breaking down, one after the other, the mental burdens of modernity. Not just in big ways; in money and in work. But in small ways too, in how we experienced places and how we thought of and understood our possessions. Upen explicitly describes an animism \u0026mdash; all things are alive. But you don\u0026rsquo;t need to believe in Upen to understand that, it\u0026rsquo;s evident throughout Vekllei. The complicated, nonsensical machinations of Vekllei society: moneylessness; product atheism; antifashions; childlessness; an absence of landscape, abstractionism, a reclamation of womanhood, etc. \u0026mdash; they could not be more simple in Vekllei, where the beautiful products of such things are unannounced and plain to see. Simplicity is in fact complicated; Vekllei is complicated, and life there is simple.\nShe still had her anxiety, of course. She was a full-colour constellation of neuroses. But living was not hard; Vekllei was approaching its epoch of rest.

Her new identity as a modern, middle-class girl had yet to emerge. It was a vacuum that needed filling in a new country where social behaviour drove your quality of life.\nClothing in Vekllei is manufactured by the same ideological forces that seek to ‚Äúdeindustrialise‚Äù the economic processes of the country ‚Äî in other words, its broad physical decommodification. This included a championing of what they indigenously called ‚Äúfashion atheism‚Äù or ‚Äúantifashions,‚Äù meaning fashion that was not designed to be sold. This did not necessarily require a return to the woollen jumpers and seal pelts of yesteryear ‚Äî just that clothing would return to the physical immediacy of art and architecture. It became what Vekllei people call ‚Äúthe decoration of ordinary life;‚Äù in other words, simply decorative and exclusively physical, and unburdened by intellectual or economic fetishisms.\nThis position is inherently conservative, in the sense that it was not supposed to change quickly, but the appearance of Vekllei‚Äôs ‚Äúantifashions‚Äù did not advocate for traditional native styles specifically ‚Äî indeed, many antifashions were quite radical both aesthetically and ideologically, and were pioneered by some of Vekllei‚Äôs most progressive art communities.\nEmploying Tzipora as an example here is not just a convenience of the project ‚Äî she is a superb example of how the internationalist movement became a symbol of the global dispossessed. Her tastes were affected by her exposure to a unique style developed in the Vekllei-Italian immigrant design schools called ‚ÄúNuova Grotessco Internazionale,‚Äù (Lit. International New Grotesque), which helped found her affection for simple clothing in simple colours.\n‚ÄúGrotesque‚Äù in this case comes from the Italian grotessco, a reference to forms so simple they could have been pulled from cave paintings. Although Tzipora was too sensible to ever seek them out, the showcase items of the Nuova Grotessco Internazionale movement were radical in their geometric simplicity ‚Äî advocating androgynous silhouettes and ‚Äúculturelessness‚Äù that looked like it came from nowhere and said nothing. Like all radical fashions, the dramatic conclusions of these ideas were moderated and filtered into general consumption in Vekllei, which went on to contribute to the popularity of new synthetic materials, space-age ‚Äúcosmocorps‚Äù styles and bright geometric patterns common in the country.\nTzipora herself was never much for the grotesque, but she was very interested in internationalist styles. She had a few choice clothing items she reproduced in most of her outfits ‚Äî she liked that her pleated shirts suggested nothing about her personality, her ethnic background, or her immigrant status. The pleated shirt is simply the ‚Äúdecoration of ordinary life.‚Äù It was inoffensive and uncomplicated. Such is the spirit of fashion atheism and the internationalist movement: clothing should suggest nothing intrinsic about you.\nIn Vekllei, this idea was seen as a critical liberator of women, and elsewhere, it was seen as an extension of international democracy and cooperation; an aesthetic of endless social mobility and freedom of expression. In Vekllei, where art was very radical and influenced heavily by continental designers, it was the ultimate symbol of postwar egalitarianism and recovery. The internationalist style has become the ‚Äònew default‚Äô of Vekllei fashion, obscuring its ideological origins through its presence in (and simple decoration of) everyday life.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-07-21-fashion/","title":"Looking Good and Feeling Good"},{"content":"","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/categories/author/","title":"author"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Thanks for a great June.

In a country without money, you can think of it as the payroll of every Vekllei person ‚Äî the body responsible for the welfare of Vekllei people.\nAlthough Vekllei does not use money domestically, the country is bound by the Floral Constitution, the Dignity in Employment Act 2016,and the Fair Work Act 2022 to provide regular, measurable increases in the standard of living for Vekllei people. It is the responsibility of the Q.L.C. to track and report these facts, measured by three metrics.\n The satisfaction of Vekllei people with actionable markets. The availability, quality, and variety of goods. The strength and maintenance of the Thousand Roses Campaign.  The Thousand Roses Campaign outlined a programme of comforts and consumer luxuries the Commission felt necessary for the satisfaction of Vekllei people and the opinion of Vekllei internationally.\nThis programme, called the Thousand Roses Award, reveals interesting tendencies within Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s cultural priorities as the country attempted to furnish its population with a standard of living suitable for twenty-first century life.\nHere are a few highlights. In its essence, fifty years after the war, the average Vekllei person should:\n Own their home Have all their children in school Work three or four days a week Holiday regularly  In addition, the Vekllei person should:\n Possess three pairs of shoes, for daily, recreational and formal occasions. Possess clothing for each day of the week, and for all occasions, so that hygiene and dignity may be preserved. Be awarded clothing for any work considered full-time. Be guaranteed the provision of cosmetics and personal sanitary items.  This is part of the origin of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s uniformed work culture ‚Äî although the Thousand Roses Award did not intend companies to specifically provide uniforms, the simplest and most affordable way of meeting the requirements of the campaign necessitated their use. Not all companies in Vekllei provide uniforms, but they must provide clothing upon request.\nThe Award also describes the basic rights of a modern Vekllei lifestyle. Any working person should:\n Be guaranteed the provision of personal tools, with which maintenance can be carried out. Enjoy equitable and reliable access to cinema, theatre, and live music. Cook with fresh produce.  In total, the Thousand Roses Award covers exactly one thousand items that contribute to the state\u0026rsquo;s vision of the postwar Vekllei lifestyle. As we can see here, some of these items are yet to be achieved universally or regularly. The basic premise of the Campaign, however, has been realised ‚Äî Vekllei people do indeed work few days, own their home, send their children to school and holiday regularly.\nAs an independent regulator of the Vekllei Government, the Quality of Life Surveillance Commission continues to hold the promises of the past to account. In a manner closely related to the Vekllei Census, Q.L.C. agents interview people throughout the year, tallying their pleasures and grievances. At the end of each year, the Commission produces a detailed report cataloguing the successes and failures that affect the Postwar Vekllei Person, and determine what Floral Society still owes them. One day, the debt will be paid in full.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-06-29-qlc/","title":"The Quality of Life Surveillance Commission"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This essay was published on millmint.net. Read it here.  I write introspectively about the project sometimes, as a means by which I consider what I\u0026rsquo;m doing and where my unconscious is leading me with this project. I have the instinct of someone who is over-educated and self-obsessed; someone who went to university, fell for the farce of serious media criticism, and failed to see that all media theorists are basically freaks. And there is a small truth buried in that hyperbole: it does in fact require a certain dysfunction to write books about the study of anime or television. You can become too close to something.\nUtopie concr√®te, or \u0026lsquo;concrete utopia,\u0026rsquo; is my phrase for how I work. I saw parallels with the manifesto of musique concr√®te, as described by Pierre Schaeffer:\n Instead of notating musical ideas on paper with the symbols of solf√®ge and entrusting their realisation to well-known instruments, the question was to collect concrete sounds, wherever they came from, and to abstract the musical values they were potentially containing.\n Utopianism is much the same; it distills the concrete sentiment, concerns, and futures of a time and place and reproduces them in abstract in fiction. In a very straightforward way, my work (Vekllei, so-called) is an abstraction of real people, events, and things.\nIt also refers to the \u0026ldquo;feeling\u0026rdquo; of Vekllei, in a transcendental fashion. Utopianism is associated with very specific, loaded conceptions of perfection \u0026mdash; cleanliness, symmetry, peacefulness, goodness, and impossibility. Vekllei is not any of these things consistently; it is like the raw concrete used in b√©ton brut, and like raw concrete it discolours, weathers and crumbles in its exposure to reality and the march of time. You can see the formwork and imperfections in its product \u0026mdash; not as a result of sloppy workmanship or carelessness, but because those things are beautiful; utopian in their own right.\nAt the risk of disfiguring these notes into a manifesto, the principles of utopie concr√®te might look something like this.\nPRINCIPLES OF UTOPIE CONCR√àTE ‚ñ†\n All things have dignity All things get dirty You must love it  To explain further:\n All things have dignity. You must take your \u0026ldquo;raw utopia\u0026rdquo; seriously \u0026mdash; it has to be honest. In this sense, you must always aim to do your best for it. Consider your landscape and give your characters the respect you would anyone. If you dishonour them through sloppy work, you should feel embarrassed.¬† All things get dirty. In order to \u0026lsquo;consider your landscape\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;respect your characters,\u0026rsquo; you must also recognise that these things need to live independently from your control. The activity of your utopia is what makes it alive, and also what makes it imperfect. Recognise the imperfections and celebrate them.¬† You must love it. Utopias are very thoughtful and considered, but they can\u0026rsquo;t be intellectual. It must be intuitive \u0026mdash; follow your heart.  UTOPIE CONCR√àTE ‚ñ† WITH VEKLLEI ‚ù¶ CHARACTERISTICS\nYou already have the tools to create your concrete utopia \u0026mdash; you just need to act on it. I have acted, and what has surfaced reveals a great deal about me, how I think and process the world, my anger and prejudices, my hopes and affections, and the pettiest of petty material interests.\nHayao Miyazaki, a great artist I admire deeply, was asked why his films starred heroines. He said:\n At first, I thought \u0026ldquo;this is no longer the era of men\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; But after ten years, I grew tired of saying that. I just say \u0026ldquo;because I like women.\u0026rdquo; That has more reality.\n I mostly draw women, and there is not much good reason for it other than I like women.\nI have said previously I\u0026rsquo;m deeply uncomfortable with the conceptual objectification of women, and the shallowness of girl-caricatures. Yet, when asked why my cast of characters are mostly women, I can only say that I like drawing women. That\u0026rsquo;s very revealing of the hypocritical discrepancy between essay rhetoric and my body of work. I try and give my characters dignity, but I also draw women and girls because they might look more interesting in a certain profession, or have better options for their clothes. Where is the dignity in being reproduced for how you appear in a picture? We can\u0026rsquo;t mistake \u0026ldquo;drawing women\u0026rdquo; for \u0026ldquo;representation of women.\u0026rdquo; This is a failing on my part.\nBut I also think that Tzipora, the most egregious and unusual example of \u0026ldquo;using the appearance of women\u0026rdquo; in my project, is not much of a woman at all. She carries my anger, my obsessiveness, and lives my fantasy of a meaningful life. She is quite explicitly an author surrogate, although with a life of her own. She is also not supposed to be an authentic depiction of the experience of any woman \u0026mdash; she is in fact closer to an anti-woman. She is so tomboyish, obsessive, and neurotic, that it\u0026rsquo;s hard to use her to explore conventional literary interests in \u0026lsquo;womanhood.\u0026rsquo; Thank goodness for that \u0026mdash; it\u0026rsquo;s not my place.\nCreating Vekllei is my way of processing the goings-on of the world, and my lived experience day-to-day. In this sense, I prefer the clothes and appearance of women, and so in my utopia I draw women.\nThis is one of the interesting contradictions of utopianism. It is inherently egoistic, and can always be traced cleanly to the total worldview and personality of its author. But like most fiction, authors are eager to give life to their people and places, and would rather you not glimpse the man behind the curtain. Vekllei is fiction \u0026mdash; Tzipora is a girl, and lives in Vekllei. Vekllei is also a utopia \u0026mdash; Tzipora is me, and lives in my hopes, dreams, and anxieties. The contradiction is muted until authors start acting like the former is not a result of the latter, and that my personal experience does not affect who and what is depicted in Vekllei. This is true of all fiction \u0026mdash; so let us not pretend cuteness is not a female burden, and my desire to draw nice clothes and interesting hairstyles is not an altruistic representation of women, no matter how well-intentioned my depictions may be.\nThis conversation is important only because Vekllei is important (to me), and the principles of utopie concr√®te are worth upholding \u0026mdash; all things must have dignity.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-06-26-utopie/","title":"Utopie ‚ù¶ Concr√®te"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Where Tzipora lived in Lola, most people remained of the working class well into the utopian period. Despite their equitable access to the fruits of the country, their housing was poorer and their problems generational. Alcoholism was very common; many of them were veterans of the War in Taiwan. Others were in great pain from their early work in the postwar years, their bodies broken by the demons of manual labour.\nA year after Tzipora arrived, the conviction of a Polish man for two murders sparked protests in Lola along ethnic lines. Protests were very common in Vekllei. In the postwar years, the grievances were often prejudiced, and intensified by the millions of immigrants who arrived in the renewed country, one which was reestablishing itself as a place of dignity for dispossessed people.\nTzipora did not like the protests because they reminded her of where she came from. Per the echoes of the past, she too found old wartime anxiety and despair resurfacing. She was feeling what we now call battle fatigue, or the neurosis of violence ‚Äî but she did not look like a soldier, and so she was not treated for it.\nAnd that sort of thing brought out the monster in Tzipora. She grappled with her own revulsion towards the anti-immigrant protestors. It upset her hearing the protests from her home. In her mind, she would like to see them shot where they stood. How short-sighted was tolerance in abstract ‚Äî why did no one seem to recognise that people needed management; they all needed management. They needed management from their own worst instincts! She had seen the wickedness of people, and now it had followed her here!\nThe protest had fizzled out by sundown. Baron watched it from the roof with a drink, apparently unconcerned. Tzipora found herself shaking with anger and had to return inside.\nThe following day, she passed by some riot officers on the way to school. She signed at them in her new Potenne to say they were doing good work. That was all she said. In her head, she was thinking get them! Go and arrest them all. How can you just stand there and watch?\nThe moment would pass, and the thoughts would settle. She was not bloodthirsty in her heart. But that side of her threatened to surface from time to time. There was some currency to the thought that she had died overseas, and she was witnessing a life unlived in the twilight of death. There is a truthfulness to anger. That side of her felt much more ‚Äòreal‚Äô for a long time after. That problem remained unresolved throughout most of her life.\n The Cosmpasnie Fedecenoayan Porits, or Compor (lit. National Police Companies), are the special paramilitary and riot control wing of the National Police, or venopor. Most police in Vekllei are stationed locally, including the National Police. The Companies, however, are mobile ‚Äî they move to meet riots, participate in counter-terrorism and counter-espionage operations, and support the Royal Vekllei Armed Forces in wartime.\nDepicted here is a riot officer in ‚Äúsilks,‚Äù the term for the Compor uniform including revolver and long truncheon. Besides her is an armoured officer of Special Tactics, which responds to serious threats of violence. The iconic Compor shield is displayed here for documentary purposes. Special Tactics carry powerful radios designed to work in all environments.\nVekllei sees protests regularly for all sorts of things, including ongoing economic grievances, cultural tension, or even more commonly political events designed to pressure government. All such occasions are met with the Compor, who are feared and reviled by a country otherwise only used to local policing.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-06-23-compor/","title":"Compor, Vekllei's Special Police"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  There was not much different about one spirit than another. Foreigners mistook Upen, the animism of Vekllei, for environmentalism ‚Äî that was not the case at all. Landscapes changed, and so did the things that lived in them.\nOf course, humans are sentimental creatures, and they become attached to native things. It is important to seperate human desire ‚Äî the protection of native plants and animals ‚Äî and the interests of spirits, since they are not the same.\nUpen is at the heart of how a Vekllei person understands the world. It describes the basis of all being, and the essence of all things, called seispri, lit. ‚Äòspirits‚Äô. Some spirits are large and complex, and can resemble creatures. Others are so small and quiet, no person could ever see them. We‚Äôll look at these later.\nTzipora is wearing traditional ritual dress. Spirits are attracted to interesting things, especially precious metals and fine materials, and so outfits like these are designed to attract their attention. Smart people dress for the occasion, and to talk to spirits you must look like a spirit.\nHer hat is called a kitpek, lit. ‚Äòflat hat,‚Äô precisely because you can fold it flat. A wide-brimmed version is still worn in agriculture today. This narrow-brim version is elegant and feminine, and decorated with gold and orange. In summer, shirts stitched with gold like these can be worn. In winter, elaborate capes take their place. You can also see here the earliest form of the gi still in use today, resting to the right of its sister-ornament, the jouvismoakoisnisn belt, with two large tassels. The gi is still worn commonly, and is even part of school uniform. The jouvismoakoisnisn is not so lucky, and today is only associated with Upen ritual.\nHer special tool is called a duapolutchi, lit. ‚Äòtwin lights,‚Äô which consists of a mounting stick and two hollow wooden balls filled with seeds. You shake it to announce the start of a meeting, or express happiness. For good measure, Tzipora has also slung gold chord around her neck and arms. All in all, a captivating show for most spirits.\nIn ritual dress, you are supposed to only communicate via Upotenne, which is the physical language of runes. It‚Äôs a form of sign language that incorporates the whole body, and is understood by most Vekllei spirits. Tzipora does not know Upotenne very well, so only says a few words before waving her ball-stick around. With any luck, they‚Äôll shower her with blessings ‚Äî or at the very least, not cause her harm next time she intrudes on them.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-06-19-spiritful/","title":"Spiritful"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Tzipora was good at cricket. That surprised everyone. Her teachers called her bookish; her classmates called her a dork. She didn‚Äôt look like a girl who played much sport. In America, at her old school, she was sick from gym class so regularly that they stopped asking about her absence.\nIn Vekllei, however, the sports were better. Instead of ‚Äúgym class,‚Äù they had physical education ‚Äî Phys Ed ‚Äî that included a variety of weekly health classes, term carnivals, and daily callisthenics. They‚Äôd pile into the gymnasium, take off dark-soled shoes, and run through simple exercises before lessons. Sometimes they‚Äôd play games instead, if they had one of the cool teachers. That was a potent memory for Tzipora, actually ‚Äî the jealousy of watching the homeroom next door play ‚Äúcrocodile‚Äù while her group were doing stretches for the second time that week.\nIt was her social environment, in the end, that got her into sports. When she didn‚Äôt know anyone, she‚Äôd read English books by the sports fields. Two weeks into watching the boys play lunchtime cricket, she took up the bat and scored six runs. It turned out Tzipora was very good at sports. She was fast and well-coordinated ‚Äî an uncultivated natural gift. That year, at the athletics carnival, she scored best out of the girls in high jump and best out of anyone in long jump.\nThat made Tzipora very popular with her classmates, because she played ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù ‚Äî she was a shy geek that was good at cricket and didn‚Äôt mind getting grass stains on her shirt. It was that duality, rather than her sportsmanship, that people liked. She was amusing enough as a character that the sports-playing boys had developed a fascination with her, and they shouted at her to join most lunchtimes. It was paternalistic, sure ‚Äî they liked her in the same way they liked the retarded rough-n-ready rugby boy in their class ‚Äî but it wasn‚Äôt mean-spirited.\nMost days, she would. She‚Äôd pull off her armband, unclip her gi, and roll up her skirt and sleeves as she made her way down to the pitch.

She worked long, hard hours at the Americas Bureau at National Intelligence, or ‚ÄòAB/NI,‚Äô as a clerk, or specialist, or whatever they needed her to be that day. Her days off were filled with petty occupations and minor obligations ‚Äî mostly tending to her plants and cleaning. She enjoyed number puzzles. A couple friends had formed a book club, and she went to that on occasion.\nTzipora‚Äôs arrival in June of 2063 saw several disruptions to Ayn‚Äôs routines, not least of which was the surfacing of her old unsentimental boyfriend, now ten years older and much different. Tzipora herself emerged into Ayn‚Äôs personal life, and they became close ‚Äî much like it was with Baron, Tzipora was both a daughter and a friend.\nIt had been Ayn‚Äôs recommendation, actually, that Baron should take her.\n‚ÄúAt least for a while,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúShe talks about you all the time. No one‚Äôs talking about adoption ‚Äî just take her until the system can sort her out. That‚Äôs my advice.‚Äù\nTzipora met Ayn‚Äôs parents later that year, and just like that, Tzipora had forged herself a new family through her force of will and good charm ‚Äî Baron, the father; Ayn, the mother; and her Hong-Konger/Russian parents. And Ayn‚Äôs parents adored her; they showered Tzipora with gifts and baked goods. She was the grandchild they‚Äôd wanted so much.\nThe whole situation aroused an ongoing memory, foggy through shame and discomfort, about her ageing parents and her unmarried lifestyle. It was very difficult for Ayn to discuss her decision not to have children with her parents. She was an only child. How do you tell your parents their ancestors, their bloodline ends with you? It hurt them a lot. It hurt Ayn too, to make that choice and follow her heart.\nAyn lived in the same studio apartment in the Great Coast she had for a decade, though she now owned it from her work. As a childless, unmarried woman it was very difficult to find larger homes, which were usually allocated to couples and families. Real estate in Vekllei was both a reward and a punishment, and informed the social fabric of the country.\nTzipora was good at being a grandchild when she needed to be, and Ayn was very thankful for her presence in their lives. Ayn loved her parents, and found herself thinking back to her own childhood more and more as they grew older. She was still their baby, and it was sometimes difficult to reconcile her own independence as an adult with her desire to make them happy. That desire ‚Äî the instinct to please ‚Äî dated back to being a little girl, dumb and full of wonder, navigating her childhood with her mum and dad, much younger then, always loving.\nAfter work, she would sometimes sit and smoke, then put it out and smell the salt on the breeze. She used to come out here to think, often melancholic about her life and decisions. Nowadays, the thoughts were lighter, more straightforward. She was more self-assured.

But that‚Äôs just how she was; Tzipora was an intricate person of many backgrounds and instincts.\nBaron was Jewish, but he didn‚Äôt practice much. He did, however, observe shabbas as a cultural legacy of his childhood. He worked six days a week, and rested Saturdays. Sometimes, he‚Äôd put on a roast in the tradition of his late father‚Äôs recipe. Other times, Tzipora would cook some of their favourite foods. Tzipora, the insistent catholic, would respect the melakhot because she liked the idea of it. Even more unusually, she welcomed the shabbas with a prayer, even though her sabbath was Sunday. That‚Äôs just how she was; you get the idea. She was a curious and deeply spiritual person, and became more fascinated with her Jewish heritage after living with Baron.\nCobian didn‚Äôt know what a Jew was; she barely understood the concept of any god. Cobian‚Äôs family were indigenous Vekllei, descended from generations of animistic Upen observers.

Boys and girls went to school together here, but they weren‚Äôt the same thing, were they? She saw girls usually clothed in capes and knee skirts showing skin she‚Äôd never seen before. There was this one girl, Cherrie, who was on the heavy side, and Tzipora marvelled unconsciously at how much bigger she looked without her uniform.

Times change.\nThe Ramoin-Dupont Aircraft Company, with help from the research subsidiary of the absurdly-named ‚ÄúGovernment Aircraft Factories,‚Äù spent about two decades trying to get a reactor to fly. It was easy enough to build a plane around a fission reactor ‚Äî the problem was keeping the pilot alive. Ramoin-Dupont figured out that, for every megawatt of power, you required about 8 tonnes of rubber and lead shielding ‚Äî an intolerable figure for a fighter or light aircraft of any kind.\nThis changed with a breakthrough at General Reactor in Montre, which had been experimenting with sunburst-style heat exchangers but couldn‚Äôt find a way to apply the technology. In air-cooled reactor setups, already established in primitive nuclear aircraft, this reactor design could significantly reduce operating temperatures and the burden of shielding with a chromium-cadmium alloy.\nThe eventual widespread refinement and adoption of these innovations changed the role of the fighter, and the satellite appearance of theatres in air warfare. The days of the air-refuelling boom or drop-tank were gone ‚Äî a nuclear bomber was now able to fly continuously around the world for up to thirty years.\nPictured here is a RD-64 Demon, built in Government Aircraft Factories Aeroyards in Montreya. Like most nuclear fighters in Vekllei, it carries its reactor beneath its fuselage, where it can be refuelled and detached for maintenance easily without grounding the aircraft for months at a time. They are tremendously fast, and thanks to the weight savings of sunburst reactors, are tremendously well-equipped for emerging air combat.\nThese jets can fly at up to 2,500km/h. They are designed for one purpose: interception. Official doctrine of Vekllei‚Äôs armed forces expects a nuclear war within a hundred years, and these jets are flown continuously over the Atlantic with powerful Horizonic radars, which talk to AEW planes and Vekllei‚Äôs navy to draw real-time maps of ‚ÄúVekllei‚Äôs Atlantic.‚Äù Its weapon systems are controlled by military automan wetware, the effectiveness of which contributes to the Demon‚Äôs reputation as a fierce opponent to the rival fighter-types currently produced in the United States and the Eastern Bloc. They also hold great affection among Vekllei pilots and daydreaming children alike, as direct descendants of the biplanes and turbojet wonders of yesteryear ‚Äî bred for a fight.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-06-04-air-atomic/","title":"Air Atomic"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Vekllei takes a lot from its land.

It is in these stations that old government infrastructure projects take on a greater meaning, and cultivate an absurd sort of spirituality that touches the lives of the people who discover them. Is there anything gentler than a concrete platform in the middle of a flower-tundra, weathered and warmed by the sun?\nThe Tzefesmiousn family in the borough of Kotaismoyeh have their very own platform ‚Äî they‚Äôre the only ones with a house here. There‚Äôs a couple of farms nearby, which load wool and meat onto freight trams periodically, but otherwise they‚Äôre the only commuters at their stop.

So, despite the heavy use of labels and text, this picture is particularly concerned with the literal appearance and structure of the Vekllei written language, called Topet.\nAs an aside, a basic overview of the language was given in this post. Please check it out to make sense of some of the terminology used here.\nThe basic process of Vekllei‚Äôs main writing script (Topet) is this:\u2028 Nouns and verbs are modified extensively by associating their subject with other pictographic characters, which have no phonetic value except for the core ‚Äúprinciple‚Äù character. For example, an ‚Äúemu‚Äù might be tall, or ‚Äúrunning‚Äù may be breathless. This grouping is called a ‚Äúminor demon‚Äù. The way these groupings look depends on how many associated characters you‚Äôre using. The principle can be written alone in the centre of a space. With two, they‚Äôre arranged side-by-side. With three, the principle sits on top of the other two in a triangular shape. With four, they become a quadrant. Sometimes, these groupings are enough. If everyone already knows what the principle characters means and how to vocalise it, you can leave it alone as a pictograph ‚Äî a literal picture, with meaning modified by the characters of its group. Quite often, however, you have to teach the reader how to say it. The minor demon lends the initial sound, and the rest have to be written in superscript next to it, as phonetic ‚Äúhelper‚Äù characters called hieyerette. These aren‚Äôt used as pictures, they‚Äôre used to help spell it out.  Of course, Vekllei has several verbal, non-verbal, signed and written languages. They don‚Äôt all work like this. Rapotenne is basically pictographic and is very, very old. It‚Äôs mostly used for names and to talk to spirits. It‚Äôs never used for conventional writing. Indeed, for signatures, most use their sigils instead.\nSo this post isn‚Äôt really intended to help you understand how the Vekllei language works, since the language is very complex and better served by the wiki article linked above. This is a showcase of style ‚Äî the way the Vekllei language looks and feels on paper.\nYou can see an example of Topet styling in this picture.\n Modern, sans-serif FLORAL STYLING is most commonly used today in print, as part of the simplification and standardisation of characters. It‚Äôs designed to be easier to write for immigrants, who arrived in Vekllei by the millions after the war. Traditional, ornamented DEMONIC STYLING carries the traditional line weights and decoration of prewar Topet, and is still used in small print like novels for its better legibility.  Most fonts in Vekllei follow in either of these two traditions.\nFinally, this infographic makes clear the basic flow of the Vekllei language, which transforms most words into complicated, sentence-like concepts layered with designed, unique meaning. ‚ÄúMinor Demons‚Äù (the character groups) are not just used for poetry but in fact for all writing, as is the nature of Vekllei communication.\nLike much else in the country, a lot of the Vekllei way of thinking is deeply conceptual and abstracted, and rarely ventures into modern literalism. This is a feature built into the language, and it affects the Vekllei understanding of many cultural artefacts. For example, the Vekllei language is not really built to describe specific places ‚Äî instead, the feeling and experience of mountains/beaches/streams is substituted in its place, quite literally by the pictographic nature of Topet.\nWhen you read Topet, you‚Äôre not just sounding out a phonetic character ‚Äî you are looking at a picture of that concept, in a transcendental fashion that prohibits specificity. This sort of indigenous conceptualisation deserves a post of its own, but hopefully this graphic has helped introduce you to the basic cadence and features of the written Vekllei word.\nLet me know, as always, if you have any questions.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-05-31-topet/","title":"How to Read Vekllei"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  There‚Äôs no other way to put it ‚Äî Tzipora is one of a kind. There are others like her, but fewer and fewer of them are born healthy as the years roll on. Her life is hard, she‚Äôd agree, but it‚Äôs also sprinkled with miracles. Meeting her, you might not even know she‚Äôs set to become the oldest person in history.\nAll stories settle on remarkable people, and Tzipora ‚Äî with or without her absurd long-livedness ‚Äî is a person of importance, and much more than the sum of her parts.\nFor those unaware, Tzipora is the 13th person in the world to be diagnosed with Gregori-Heitzfeld Disease (GHD), a genetic disorder that surfaced in the 21st Century. Many more than 13 preceded her, but few ‚ÄúGregori babies,‚Äù as they‚Äôre called, ever make it to a hospital for a diagnosis. Where exactly GHD came from depends on who you ask ‚Äî the synthetic preservatives in food? Residual radiation, from a century of atomic testing? The over-sexualisation of media? Tzipora accidentally swallowed a lead ball as a child ‚Äî that‚Äôs as good a guess as any.\nGregori babies do not grow up, and they do not die of old age.\nShe makes up part of the ‚Äúfirst wave‚Äù of Gregori discovery, comprising of about fifty individual cases across fifteen years starting in the late 2050s. These boys and girls are, on average, healthier and less affected physically by their disease than those born today. Fatal rates of GHD have increased dramatically in recent years, and very few ‚ÄòGregori babies‚Äô born today live beyond 24 months after onset. Like a passing comet, the miracle children seem to be vanishing as quickly as they appeared.\nIt is commonly misunderstood that Gregori children don‚Äôt reach puberty. This is not quite true ‚Äî they do in fact undergo hormonal changes that usually signal the biological transition into sexual maturity, but are a victim of a poorly-understood protein dysfunction that affects their development and cell reproduction.\nGregori-Heitzfeld, as poorly understood as it is, is not a single malfunction of the human body. It is the intersection of two distinct genetic failings in critical proteins that occur in the oestrogen receptors and enzymes of the body. Let‚Äôs have a look at how this works, to the best of contemporary understanding.\nOestradiol is an oestrogen that binds to subtypes of the body‚Äôs oestrogen receptors. Of interest here is the agonistic reaction it exerts on a receptor known as the G protein-coupled oestrogen receptor (GPER), a protein responsible for oestradiol‚Äôs nongenomic signalling effect on cells. After activation, GPERs exert dramatic and varied effects on the regulation of many parts of the body, including cell growth, and is found not just in oestrogen-receptive tissues but throughout the brain, lungs, skeleton, muscular system and immune cells. In persons suffering from GHD, increased production of oestradiol during puberty onset upregulate GPERs, which has cascading effects on cell production throughout the body, mostly with gonadotrophin-releasing hormones (discussed below).\nAs aforementioned, however, GPER dysfunction is only part of the puzzle. GHD only occurs in the presence of another malfunction of the telomerase enzyme, a ribonucleoprotein which extends telomeres in the human chromosome. Prior to GHD onset, the function of the telomerase RNA templates are unaffected, but once malfunctioning GPER proteins are activated by oestradiol enzymes, a local protein misfolding (not dissimilar to prion diseases) occurs that disrupts part of the telomerase catalytic cycle built into the RNA template of the telomerase itself. This affects the pause signal of telomerase DNA synthesis and offsets the natural telomere loss rate in chromosomes, altering cycle lengths of DNA elongation. This is the primary event that contributes to the so-called biological immortality of some Gregori-Heitzfeld patients, since it offsets the loss of most types of somatic cells which would otherwise age and die. In many others, however, the protein misfolding in GPER-telomerase signalling develops into a fatal neurodegenerative disorder called Variant Gregori-Heitzfeld Disease (vGHD). In the last ten years, most ‚ÄòGregori babies‚Äô are in fact victims of vGHD.\nThe malfunction of GPER proteins also has some kind of affect on the secretion of gonadotrophin-releasing hormones (GnRHs), which affect physical development of the body in pubescence. The interaction between GPERs and GnRHs are still poorly understood, and the complicated effects GHD has on this relationship are almost entirely elusive. What is obvious is that most suffering from GHD do not develop physically beyond the onset of the disease, triggered in girls by pubescence sometime between the ages of 12 and 16. In Tzipora‚Äôs case, who perhaps remains the healthiest example of a ‚ÄòGregori baby,‚Äô her puberty is absent despite the increased production of oestrogens triggered by late thelarche. No Gregori baby has ever entered menarche ‚Äî at least in part a result of GnRH suppression by faulty GPER proteins.\nThe extraordinary rarity of these genetic disorders intersecting contributes to a disease unlike any other. At some point while living in Sacramento, Tzipora slowly stopped ageing. At first, she was just a victim of delayed prepubescence ‚Äî she was underweight, after all. Then, it was a hormone disorder. By the time she was in Vekllei, she was the country‚Äôs first ‚Äúunageing lady.‚Äù\nOur understanding of Gregori-Heitzfeld Disease remains rudimentary because, in part, Tzipora makes up most of its scholarship. She is one of the few healthy Gregori babies to voluntarily submit to public medical research, and so most of our understanding comes from her case specifically. There are many gaps in our understanding. Why are Gregori babies not riddled with rapid-growing cancers as their cells metastasise rapidly? Why are the protein misfolds linked to these specific enzymes, and why don‚Äôt they spread throughout the body and brain as they do in vGHD? And, perhaps of most interest to the public ‚Äî where are they going? Why are our new so-called ‚Äúimmortal children‚Äù dying?\nTzipora does not consider herself a ‚ÄòGregori baby,‚Äô because she considers herself ‚ÄòTzipora‚Äô. When she was diagnosed at 16, there were only 10 others like her in the world ‚Äî there was no Gregori community support group. By the time there were hundreds, the disease was rapidly degenerating into vGHD and resembled something closer to a tragic prion disease. These are topics she does not like to think about much.\nVekllei affords her dignity, because it does not have a cultural concept of a child. Children exist, of course. They are loved, and go to school, and learn about the world from guardians around them. But they are afforded dignity as human beings, and generally take on responsibilities at a much younger age. This doesn‚Äôt mean Tzipora‚Äôs life is easy. Her life is not easy. But if she wants to work, she may work. If she wants to travel alone, she may travel alone. And if she wants a glass of wine with dinner, restaurants will accommodate.\nThese are not special luxuries afforded to her, but basic rights of all young people. In this sense, she is relieved of the inconvenience of justifying her dignity as a person continuously, and allows her to command authority and respect throughout her life.\nIn the scope of her life, immortality and youthfulness is usually the last thing on her mind.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-05-28-forever/","title":"Zelda's Guide to Living Forever"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  You know you‚Äôre near the homeland of the Magma-Electric Commission when you smell it. Somewhere between cracking a rotten egg and standing downwind of a sewerage treatment plant, the volcanic heartlands of Vekllei are the playground of the Magma-Electric Commission, often shortened to just ‚ÄúThe Magma‚Äù or ‚ÄúThunderburo‚Äù. The smell is caused by Hydrogen Sulphide, a byproduct of the naked volcanic activity Vekllei is known for.\nSulphur is everywhere in Vekllei ‚Äî even in the cities, the drinking water smells of it. It even overpowers the perfume of a ro, the Vekllei flower-tundras. In the places where the smell is most intense, you usually find a geothermal power plant nearby.\nIn Vekllei, The Magma pumps water deep into the belly of the Earth, so deep that the temperature and pressure cause the water to go supercritical, at which point it‚Äôs neither a liquid or a gas. Supercritical water carries much more energy than water or steam, and produces much more electricity ‚Äî so much so that residences in Vekllei are powered entirely by geothermal (Magma-Electric Commission) and hydroelectric (Hydro-Electric Commission) facilities.\nThere is a so-called ‚Äúflash plant‚Äù in Miyatvousi, in the Lava region of Vekllei. Lava is full of plants like these. A rail line runs near its injection well, where fresh glacial runoff is transformed into clean, limitless electricity through the miracle of its landscape and human ingenuity. The water is recycled, but excess waste water is dumped into the surrounding ro, forming foggy pools of light blue water. The earth here is alive; in the cold, the ponds begin to steam.\nMoise had complicated ambitions of becoming a filmmaker. As with all student filmmakers, he drafted his friends to help.\nHis girlfriend, Coretti, operated the compact 8mm camera. Tzipora was the production assistant, doing makeup and foley and whatever he asked of her. Cobian was going to be a star ‚Äî that‚Äôs what he said to her, anyway, and he paired her up with a mate of his in what would be an epic short film about lost love.\nIt was Tzipora who suggested Miyatvousi, since she‚Äôd developed a good catalogue of scenic locations in her quest to find natural shrines. There was a place where the rail line crossed a small mineral lake, near the flash plant‚Äôs turbine halls. If worked out just right, you could have a shot that‚Äôd make the whole film. It was a hell of a journey ‚Äî a bullet train in the morning to Krafla, where they got breakfast, and a two-hour local train far out from the city.\nAs it unfolds, you never realise how good a moment is. It was maybe the second or third-best day of Tzipora‚Äôs life. She didn‚Äôt know Coretti all that well, and it was the first time they‚Äôd talked about things other than Moise. They were on a great adventure, and they all knew it. They laughed when Moise coughed out his coffee all over himself and pretended to be interested when Tzipora talked at length about how geothermal power plants work.\nAt first, the gig had been sort of a joke for Cobian ‚Äî she was humouring the friend of her girlfriend ‚Äî but as the film progressed, she realised how talented and passionate her friends were. They were deeply odd and talented people, and they believed in what they were doing ‚Äî Cobian had never had friends like that before. On the train back to Lola, as the city lights of the capital loomed, Cobian turned to Tzipora and told her that she loved her for the first time.\nAmbitious, arrogant, naive, laughing, well-fed, tired, and in love.

In the old days, many hundreds of years ago, Vekllei‚Äôs long, dark winters forced subsistence farmers to preserve their dishes for six or seven months of the year. This changed under the Junta, which opened trade with the Scandinavian powers, and Vekllei soon saw its growing population dependent on fresh imports of oats and grain from Europe. These Atlantic people, whose diets were previously gamey and nomadic, were now a rough storm away from famine.\nToday, the diets are the same but the pressures on food production are even more intense. This island has nearly 22 million people on it. The postwar Vekllei Government is terrified of the vulnerability of its indigenous, isolated ecosystems, and heavily restricts raw food imports. Meanwhile, Vekllei cuisine values freshness, localism and sustainability. These are facts that cannot coexist in a place that cannot reliably grow food outside for half the year.\nThe simple answer, then, is that Vekllei cuts corners on its food production. It does not attempt to reliably produce meat, which effectively banishes traditional cuisine to rural areas and those willing to hunt puffins themselves. For what animals are slaughtered, all parts of their body are used, and quite often all you‚Äôll find at a butcher is sweetbreads and black pudding. Quality meat is synthetic, grown as isolated cells in massive liquid solutions. Even blood and organs are synthesised in industrial quantities for human consumption. Vegetables, which only entered the mainstream diet of Vekllei in the 20th Century, are grown in huge quantities under sun lamps, powered by limitless fission. The factory process of synthesising foods is called sincrestiprosmaious (lit. Grown/Made Produce, or similar).\nWith these unusual facts in mind, let‚Äôs take a look at a breakfast feast prepared by Commis Chef Tzipora, which features a selection of indigenous Vekllei breakfast foods.\nThe basic composition of a Vekllei breakfast is its proteins (egg, meats, and cheese), drinks (coffee, citrus juice, or light breakfast tea), fried or raw vegetables (potato and rutabaga) and sweet items (usually a bun, pastry, or breakfast roll and honey).\nThe humble egg is a staple rarely in short supply in Vekllei, and one or two are scrambled or fried most mornings, often assembled on rye with briga (a soft Vekllei cheese with a taste similar to feta) and gos (bitter Vekllei moss). Scrambled eggs are especially popular due to their availability, a result of their ease of synthesis, and flavoured with red spice (factory chilli) or herbs.\nGenuine meat is scarce in Vekllei and eaten only occasionally, most commonly in rural areas close to livestock. Most genuine breakfast meats consist of cold, sliced ham or sausages, which are packed with breadcrumbs due to meat scarcity. Vekllei has a type of blood sausage made of genuine pork blood or synthetic substitutes grown in stem cell hematopoietic vats, which are packed with oatmeal, groats and mint, making a black pudding called rue bouismesn (lit. Blood Sausage). Lamb sausages, called blanc oa bouismesn (lit. White Sausage) are also common.\nVekllei people drink a lot of tea and coffee ‚Äî about 7 pounds a year of each. They eat a lot of bread and pastry ‚Äî about 200 pounds a year. They like their butter and lamb, but don‚Äôt go in much for pork. Game, like puffins, are eaten regularly, though less than seafood or lamb. All of these items are eaten with breakfast in various ways, most famously agne loh lebeau (lit. Lamb Butter) which is a delicious buttery meat spread for toast, or lava oa agnetunfisk (lit. Buttered Lava Tuna), which is cooked until it falls apart and assembled with potatoes and eggs.\nVekllei people like rich, sweet foods, and we can see that here at breakfast. Coffee is sweetened with condensed milk or raw sugar and stirred thoroughly with milk. Tea is much the same. We have here a long pastri, a ‚Äúlong pastry‚Äù filled with fruit, which is eaten with (and often dipped in) your hot drink. A large spiced bun with coconut icing, called a sibun (lit. Pale Bun) is a native favourite.\nVekllei people love food. In a way, it has satisfied the vacuum of moneyless society. It is bargained for help, traded for goods, and gifted for favour. It is also one of the largest compromises of Vekllei‚Äôs way of doing things. Upen has a very clear materials hierarchy ‚Äî things made by you, from things around you, which you understand and respect are best. Below that, there are high quality local things made by others. At the very bottom are synthetic, man-made, factory-produced materials churned out to meet demand. Food in Vekllei undeniably exists in this last category for the vast majority of city-dwelling people.\nYou can reclaim the spiritual purity of foods somewhat by simply loving the ingredients you obtain ‚Äî the black pudding might be grown in vats, but why not transform it by crumbling it over a salad with a nice vinaigrette you‚Äôve made yourself? To alleviate some of this metaphysical tension, most Vekllei neighbourhoods are filled with greenhouses and local shared gardens, which ensures most meals have some produce in which you have participated. That‚Äôs very important. Some people think that, because Vekllei has abolished money, it has abolished the fetishism of products. The opposite is true ‚Äî Vekllei life is about the love and respect of materials, a feature built into the animism of Upen. You cannot buy the best food in Vekllei ‚Äî you have to find it, in a trial of ownership.\nSitting down and enjoying food is a cornerstone of life in Vekllei. You cannot participate in society without it. For immigrants, the privacy of a quiet breakfast is good practice for the palettes and conventions of eating in Vekllei ‚Äî so load up your plates.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-05-09-breakfast/","title":"A Vekllei Breakfast"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Shattered fjords make up the north of Vekllei, particularly in boroughs like Santes (lit. Saint) which are well-regarded for their striking cliffs and sloping igneous fingers, which evidence Vekllei‚Äôs ongoing volcanism. Offshore, hundreds of islets rise and sink over the centuries.\nThis is the tiny village of Cult, which sits on the sparse tip of the Grimsy Fjord. It has a local train, but is otherwise only serviced by the Santes regional express ‚Äî a mere single step up on Vekllei‚Äôs train hierarchy. This makes it relatively isolated by Vekllei‚Äôs rail-dense metrics. Cult‚Äôs shorefront is flanked by rocky cliffs that shelter its beaches, which means most of the town is squeezed further in and higher up. By the station at sea level, only a cafe and a handful of factories greet alighting passengers.\nIn her final year of secondary school, Tzipora had developed a fascination with Upen‚Äôs ‚Äúnatural shrines,‚Äù which contributed to her rapidly developing brand of Judeo-Catholic Upen mysticism. Sometimes after school, when all Cobian wanted was a snack and a movie, Tzipora would drag her onto a bullet train and seek out new shrines ‚Äî unique natural features ‚Äî described in Upen‚Äôs sagas. They would change trains ‚Äî again, then again ‚Äî and finally they‚Äôd arrive in some backwater Tzipora had read about. Then they‚Äôd go looking.\nCobian keenly remembered watching two days‚Äô worth of essay fly out of Tzipora‚Äôs arms and scatter towards the beach in Cult, and thinking that it served her right, just a little bit. It seemed to Cobian that the winds were telling Tzipora to pack up and go home.\n Vekllei National Rail (VNR) has a straightforward scheme for the names of its trains. Each is given a regional name ‚Äî usually a flower or moss, the most important plants in Upen ‚Äî and then the year is appended. This here is a Lesvesn 59-Series, since it entered production with Arisdeh Coachworks in 2059. Its bright orange livery (VNR Orange, specifically) means it‚Äôs a regional train ‚Äî local trains have unique colours voted on by their passengers. The Lesvesn 59-Series is a DC electric multiple unit train type used all over Vekllei, most commonly on quiet semi-express routes, since the trains most often appear in two-car or even single unit configurations. Its bigger cousin, the Mustard 56-Series, is often seen in the cities.

Although VNR has existed since independence, and is more or less the ancestor of the prewar Junta rail monopoly in floral-period makeup, its uniforms were overhauled in celebration of ‚Äú250 years of rail‚Äù in 2055. Their jackets display Vekllei‚Äôs optimism in the future of plastic-based fabrics in fashion.\nLike most work in Vekllei, their appearance is professional but their manner is informal.\n‚ÄúWhat are you doing there?‚Äù Who, me? ‚ÄúYeah, this is your line mate. Yellow, just keep following yellow, all right?‚Äù\nTheir shifts are short, but platform work is boring. Most trade shifts to get as much time on the trains as they can, where they can enjoy Vekllei‚Äôs exquisite scenery from some of the world‚Äôs finest public transport.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-04-25-rail/","title":"The People of Vekllei National Rail"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Cobian first met Tzipora at Caf√© Maz, though before then she knew her as ‚ÄòTzipora, the New Girl,‚Äô or, less favourably, ‚ÄòTzipora the Gypsy,‚Äô since there was some confusion about where she‚Äôd come from. The neighbourhood had known about her for a while, since people like to talk about foreigners, and when she was spotted at the Caf√© people talked about that too. Meeting her, Cobian understood why she had become a fascination. She had keen blue eyes that were very gentle, and quite slow-moving. She would look at you, then casually to the wall, then to her shoes, then back to you. The peacefulness in her face contrasted dramatically with the intensity of her movements, which were frenetic and unconscious. She had a tic where she would pull on her nose and shirt, which combined with her novice Potenne, had her hands moving almost constantly as she talked. She was aware of this, because she would notice it periodically and grab her free hand, all without breaking eye contact or the cadence of her conversation. She was very funny; Cobian immediately liked her.\nCobian was a soft-willed sort of person, unopinionated and eager to be liked. Every fact filtered down to a reasonable compromise ‚Äî there was a little bit of good in everything. Some people call that way of thinking gentle. Maybe she was just a little incurious.\nTzipora was her opposite. She lived in a binary world of Tzipora metrics. Things were either pure and beautiful, disgusting and reprehensible, or not worth thinking about. All things passed through this process ‚Äî cars, food, clothes, the shape of a curve, and the form of a kettle. Some people call that way of thinking judgemental. She was.\nThis fierce intuition applied to people too, and Tzipora had a good memory. She wasn‚Äôt afraid to confront someone if they upset her, which earned her a slap now and then from some girl too rude to take shit from.\n‚ÄúYou can hit me, slap me like that,‚Äù Tzipora would say, sneering and rearing back on her heels. ‚ÄúFor you to raise your hand against me, like you would a dog ‚Äî I‚Äôll show you, bitch.‚Äù\nShe would stop by Cobian‚Äôs house, sometimes holding her collar together where a button used to be or nursing an elbow, and they‚Äôd sit out back where her mother couldn‚Äôt see them.

Not that she said it to me, but that she thinks she can say such a thing in the first place, like I‚Äôd just pretend I hadn‚Äôt heard it.‚Äù\nTzipora wrestled with the things she said and did constantly. In fact, the ongoing judgement of herself was perhaps the most nuanced opinion Tzipora ever had, one that didn‚Äôt fit into the pure/despicable binary. Most days, she landed on self-disgust, and yet‚Ä¶\nTzipora pulled on her nose and sniffed, like she did whenever she was nervous, and looked at Cobian.\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like me blowing up, I‚Äôll try and stop it for you.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to stop for me, I want you to stop for yourself.

They occupy a function somewhere between special policing and the paramilitary, linking Vekllei‚Äôs treasured infrastructure with its civilian police (‚ÄúCosmopor‚Äù), armed forces, and shadowy intelligence networks. Though they fulfil police functions today, their history is with the Royal Guards and Federal Police of yesteryear, which in turn has produced unusual units like the Gold Sappers, which are unique in modern policing.\nGold Sappers are the official police/security detachment of the National Mint of Vekllei. Contrary to popular belief, Vekllei does in fact mint coinage, but the Mint is also responsible for the production of paper ‚ÄúGovernment Crowns‚Äù (i.e. labour-backed government bonds) and Vekllei‚Äôs gold bullion reserve.\nThough Vekllei may not use money domestically, it spends and receives huge quantities of cash through the International Market in trade with other countries. In many cases, trade is made via gold bullion, which still backs the Vekllei Crown (not the Government Crown ‚Äî click here if you‚Äôre confused). Although this gold is often simply moved around a vault in foreign reserves, like the Euro Bullion Exchange or Fort Knox, there are many cases where gold is moved into, out of, and around Vekllei.\nThis is what the Gold Sappers are deployed to protect ‚Äî Vekllei‚Äôs national wealth, in and out of transit. Their name and appearance date back to the colonial Atlantic Junta, when their historical units were deployed to pillage and steal from vulnerable infrastructure amidst war. In Vekllei‚Äôs convoluted military history, these unceremonious and criminal units were at some point folded into the Junta‚Äôs Royal Guards, then Federal Police, and now exist within the postwar Floral Period Venopor. In typical fashion for Vekllei, the Gold Sappers are no longer sappers, nor are they a part of the military. Remember, we are discussing a country in which the postal service is a military organ.\nStill, the Venopor Gold Sappers retain the beards of their ancestral units, and preserve parts of their heritage through their ceremonial parade dress and traditional songs. In this image we can see illustrated two Sappers in both civilian and paramilitary dress. The redhead holds a submachine gun equipped with drum magazines, which are unusual but commonly used in security units to achieve initial fire superiority and suppress, which allows for repositioning and backup in convoy environments.\nTheir vehicle is a R.V. Z-type (a military 4WD chassis used in all sorts of configurations) powered by a high-torque electric motor and charged by supercapacitors. That snorkel is for cooling, not exhaust. The Mint Z-type (called a ZMi-1 or -2) are used as escort cars in ground convoys, with bullion protected in armoured trucks. The Mint also has a train, and, in more common use, armoured helijets and jet planes. Gold Sappers accompany their gold and coins every step of the way. Otherwise, its navy livery is indicative of its authority as a Venopor police wagon.\nGold Sappers stand out ‚Äî beards are prohibited across every other armed branch except the spooks and sappers. If you see a Mint convoy coming, stand well back and let it pass ‚Äî for a country without money, they take their coins seriously.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-04-09-sappers/","title":"Gold Sappers"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here   A woman has so many parts to her body, life is very hard indeed.\n ‚Äî Lu Xun, 1927\n Even from my point of view, as a woman, there is nothing attractive about such \u0026lsquo;backward elements.\u0026rsquo; Their skin is beginning to wrinkle, their hair is growing thin, and fatigue is robbing them of their last traces of attractiveness.\n ‚Äî Ding Ling on the long-marcher woman soldiers, 1942\nWhen Tzipora first arrived in Vekllei in 2063, she was traumatised by the foreignness of everything. It was not just that they drove on the wrong side of the road, or that the chocolate was made by someone else, but that her whole understanding of the world ‚Äî the world she‚Äôd been raised in all her life ‚Äî was unravelled within weeks. It did not matter if you learned the language, or dressed like them, or worked with them ‚Äî the way a Vekllei person thinks seemed totally alien, as though they were tuned into a frequency that she couldn‚Äôt hear. That was very difficult for her.\nHer clearest memory, out of all the emotional turmoil in her first few weeks, was the clothes. Tzipora was not fashionable or materialistic, but she‚Äôd never had nice things to wear. In Vekllei the things on the rack were simple, and often second-hand, but they were very well made and the department stores had a big variety. She picked out five shirts, nearly identical, and decided that these would be what she would wear from now on ‚Äî it was her own way of establishing an identity; SHE IS THE GIRL WHO WEARS THIS TYPE OF SHIRT. Little things like that mattered a lot, because Tzipora was treated differently here. She was both ‚Äòyoung‚Äô and a ‚Äògirl‚Äô, which had implications for how overseas people talked to her and how she was regarded. Here, almost no one seemed to notice. She had dignity by default, which was exciting and scary at the same time, so she needed something other than her appearance to claim as ‚Äòhers‚Äô. And at that time, it was the shirt with the pleats.\n Vekllei is a place that is very much radical but, either intentionally or as a byproduct of its opaque culture, suppresses the appearance of radicalism in its public affairs (or as they say there, ‚Äòsun-facing space‚Äô). This is for a few reasons. First, Vekllei uses its obscurity as a weapon against its continental neighbours, who might pull it into geopolitical tensions it wants no part of. The second is that Vekllei‚Äôs failed revolutionary movements of the early 20th Century are buried with the Junta that suppressed them. The third, and most critically, is that Vekllei people themselves are unaware of just how saturated their lives are with the cultural and political ideology of the floral period, which makes ‚Äúforeign‚Äù political thinking difficult and results in a lot of empty rhetoric ‚Äî for example, ‚Äúpetticoat socialism‚Äù describes the Bureau System, which does not have much to do with either petticoats or continental socialism.\nThis paradigm makes more sense when you consider that there are really two Veklleis ‚Äî the one that existed before the Atomic War, and the one that exists now, called the ‚ÄúFloral Period‚Äù or sometimes ‚ÄúPetticoat Society‚Äù. The one that existed before has little resemblance to the one that exists now, and that is the way people have continued to think in the decades of independence ‚Äî anything prior to 2015 is, simply, history.\nMake no mistake ‚Äî Vekllei is tremendously radical in its culture and politics, which it tempers with conservative names and third-way politicking. Today‚Äôs post looks at how the Vekllei woman changed in the years between 2005 and 2020.\nNot unlike revolutions of years past, postwar Vekllei had (for the moment, at least) lost many of its structural oppressors of women, since the structure itself had collapsed quickly. The interim government had taken an orthodox, though contrarian, communist position, which ushered a new handbook of rhetoric towards de-objectification of women and their pragmatic and social value in the workforce. The interim government had several key women figures among it, who are credited with its success in this critical, and rapidly changing period.\nIn the Vekllei socialist (socialisme oa Vekllei) line of thinking, there are two points of attack. There was the suppression of old models of feminine beauty, which argued against women‚Äôs independence and dignity in favour of their security with men, who made up Vekllei‚Äôs economic and social caste throughout the entirety of the Junta‚Äôs rule. But there was also a very real fear that women‚Äôs liberation by Western metrics would simply evolve indentured living into a more obtuse, and in some ways more sinister, commodity-woman (cosmavisiousnesh, lit. ‚Äòplastic woman‚Äô1), who was free to educate herself but found her appearance subjected to permanent scrutiny ‚Äî a product for a consumer, dependent on shifting fashions and complex social constellations still fundamentally controlled by men. This fear was not unfounded, as many educated women of the interim government (who made up nearly half of its members) had spent significant time in Western Europe and the United States, and were keenly aware of who was ‚Äúgazing‚Äù (lismious) and who was being ‚Äúgazed at‚Äù (visimett).\nThe solution developed by the interim government was both political and spiritual, designed to demolish the external remnants of Vekllei‚Äôs pre-war and highly stratified society, and the looming threats of foreign investment, new wealth, and an import of the modern commodity-woman. Most importantly, it understood that present notions of empowerment or disempowerment were problematic unto themselves ‚Äî whether it was sexual liberation, modesty, or indeed the economic role of women in abstract ‚Äî their ability to empower was still fundamentally chained to old society, which was still dominated by the sexist cultural default.\nIn 2016, Cisma de Diviousmesn, First Secretary of the War Recovery Committee, described the problem as such in The Atlantic.\n We are nearing a precipice that all Vekllei women may fall into, should we follow unblinkingly the Visis Plan [postwar redevelopment plan], and allow foreign investment to replace English colonial governor-generals; we should be wise enough, so to speak, to not trade a king for a master and call it recovery.\n In Upen‚Äôs discourse on womanhood, the essential virtues of a woman have always included good words, good work and good fortune ‚Äî emphasising the role of women as both an alias for success/wealth and also as responsible for that fortune themselves, either in the workplace or through their innate spirituality. This has remained true throughout much of Vekllei‚Äôs history, but was obfuscated by the economic masculinity of Vekllei‚Äôs protectionist mercantile period. After the war, Upen saw a revival that would culminate in the spiritual fever of the late 2010s and early 2020s. The interim government co-opted this surge pragmatically, encouraging a shift in local perceptions of womanhood through spiritual, rather than political or ideological, methods.\n‚ÄúThis is a New Age,‚Äù the posters said. ‚ÄúSo become a New-Age Woman.‚Äù2\nBecoming a New Age Woman involved two things ‚Äî tearing down the external oppressions of the old and interim periods (harassment, domestic violence, and male interference in the affairs of women), and the interrogation of internalised sexisms (empowerment by male opinion [this included styles women found attractive, as inherited from men], abolishment of economic preoccupations, and the reconstruction of womanhood in abstract). This individual struggle was supported by the many social programmes developed by the interim government, with names like ‚Äúeconomic feminisation‚Äù (abolishment of the male economic burden) and ‚Äúabolishment of self-beautification for your man‚Äù (scisimionze, or ‚Äúself-adornment/self-beautification‚Äù).\nThe point was not to empower women by simply displacing men from male economic and social constructions ‚Äî a move that was seen as disempowering because of who was setting those priorities ‚Äî but to rebuild Vekllei‚Äôs domestic understanding of ‚Äúthe woman‚Äù by the terms of women, legitimised by the authority of the interim government and the powerful cultural force Upen continues to have on society. Within such a culture, it was reasoned, women would be free to choose what womanhood meant to them, since it was not simply reactive to a sexist cultural default. The sum of this effort was called ‚Äòsun-facing,‚Äô or semoisnesne, which referred to the progressive attitude of both the individual and the country.\nAlthough Vekllei‚Äôs New Age Woman had dramatic effects and benefitted the status of women in Vekllei society tremendously, it was nonetheless fundamentally political and had obscure and surprising cultural artefacts buried within. The idea that a woman would be ‚Äúfree to choose‚Äù her own womanhood was a little misleading, since the interim government was rapidly developing its plan for ‚Äúpetticoat society,‚Äù in which Sundress Municipalism, the Bureau System and Floral Aestheticism would become such powerful cultural forces that no man nor woman would be able to escape them entirely.\nAs the wealth of the country grew and then exploded in the transition to Vekllei‚Äôs floral society, it was clear how the structure of petticoat society continued to influence women in Vekllei. Women can wear whatever they like ‚Äî but simplicity and subtle self-decoration are common and encouraged by the uniforms system and floral aesthetics. Women can live however they like ‚Äî but education is compulsory in childhood and highly valued, and young women are encouraged to fulfil ‚Äòthe female inclination for leadership‚Äô inherited from Upen‚Äôs mother-metaphysics. And women can date whomever they like ‚Äî though ideological compatibility, and not appearance, is encouraged in the semoisnesne attitude.\nSome of these things are easily argued as good ‚Äî few would assume there are many feminists in the world who argue against the education of women ‚Äî but they do betray the notion of truly ‚Äúfree‚Äù choice, insofar as Vekllei society is dominated by the economic and spiritual values of its structure. Vekllei considers capitalist economics, exponential growth, and gross historicism to be ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù ‚Äî of course that sort of language trickles down into the social aspects of society. More directly, it prioritises form, colour, and purity in aesthetics ‚Äî of course that aesthetic ideology affects how people dress, and contributes to its uniformed culture.\nIt is difficult to place where the state begins and ends in Vekllei, which is how it can be argued for as an unfree and anarchic society simultaneously. So too is it difficult to determine how much of Vekllei culture originates in the centres of power in Vekllei ‚Äî either political or religious ‚Äî and subsequently there are problems in clarifying how women are affected by power, especially since women participate and in some cases dominate those hierarchies. Are they externalised, or internalised? Who is gazing at who?\nRegardless of Vekllei‚Äôs cultural obscurity, which affects much more than politics and many people other than women, it is clear a dramatic and liberating shift occurred in Vekllei‚Äôs interim period of independence, and that shift has contributed tremendously to the status of contemporary Vekllei women, who enjoy economic and social freedoms that were unimaginable just decades prior. Even though Vekllei has not embraced political iconography to celebrate their indigenous feminism, we can see just how radical and wide-ranging the changes made were.\n  The phrase \u0026ldquo;plastic woman\u0026rdquo; was coined by author John Graves, whose work found popularity in postwar Vekllei after its translation.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Cosmatsisosmiosne de Ne, lit. \u0026ldquo;Woman of the New Age\u0026rdquo;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-04-01-woman/","title":"Vekllei's New-Age Women"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Out in Voya Voya, the gardens light the people, and distill human temperament into momentary, sequential lyrical images.

Every time the storm made a noise Cobian sighed quietly, and Tzipora looked at her anxiously, wringing her hands like she did when she was nervous.\nAfter the film, they stepped into the lobby to find the rain had ceased. In fact, it had vanished ‚Äî the gutters were running like hell, and every corner of every roof dripped.

Everyone in the North of Vekllei knows about it. Mysteries abound. Even in our atomic century, the humans of Vekllei are enamoured with and terrified by the ocean.\nIn the Winter of 2018, just three years into Vekllei‚Äôs shaky, indigent independence, the TransNorth Oil Company purchased a submarine icebreaker called Sea Serpent from U.S. Oil. It was a crock of shit, built in the late ‚Äò80s to move crude through the Arctic in the difficult seasons. Submarine icebreakers were among the ugliest boats ever made, with thin necks that cut through ice and a warty conn crown.\nIt was not unusual for no-name oil companies to buy up old shipping stock, but TransNorth was something else. If you tracked its company address, you came to a dilapidated warehouse in Memphis with signage affixed ‚Äî totally deserted. It appears, following the paperwork, no one at all had purchased the Sea Serpent.\nTwo months after its sale, an unregistered vessel by chance triggered a decades-old Soviet detection buoy near Vekllei‚Äôs EEZ. The Common Interest Watchhawk programme, designed to demilitarise the Arctic after the Atomic War, allowed the Soviets to report the event to Vekllei and the U.K. ‚Äî perhaps suspicious it was a clandestine U.S. nuclear sub.\nSomewhere in a command room of Vekllei‚Äôs fledgeling secret service (back then called the Office of National Intelligence, the predecessor to HO/NI), a siren fired off. Sixty minutes later, a military helijet touched down in Basa, a northern military office. A destroyer left port in Montre.\nThe buoy was working correctly, and the quiet hum of commercial submarine tech was tracked for eight hours, all the way to Vekllei‚Äôs territorial waters. There, the mystery vessel was radioed, radioed again, and destroyed. There was no tolerance for smugglers or spooks in postwar Vekllei.\nThirty minutes after depth charges boomed in the North Sea, the Sea Serpent ran aground on an isolated beach in Eyri. It pushed itself right into the shallows, slashing its coolant pipes on the rocks as it capsized into the beach. With ionised radiation glowing faintly in the water, naval commandos stormed the conning tower, now on its side. Radio equipment, maps, chairs ‚Äî it had all been flung across the dim interior in its capsizing. Inside were eight men in plain clothes, all dead. All were shot ‚Äî one self-inflicted.\nIt was not until fifty years later, during the Dallas Crisis and the secession of the Dallas States, that some sort of clue as to the lair of the Sea Serpent emerged. As negotiations dragged on for the Dallas lend-lease of U.S. government properties and infrastructure, a building owned by the Chroma Industrial Concern, a Floridian company subsidised by Washington, was included in a trade of some 614 assets leaked to AB/NI. A young AB/NI asset named Baron Desmoisnes, part of the team filing the leaks, followed up and found Chroma had a warehouse in Memphis.\nIt appears the Sea Serpent was coming for Vekllei ‚Äî who says snakes don‚Äôt commit suicide?\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-03-17-serpent/","title":"Killing a Sea Serpent"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article was part of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Ocean Month in March 2021  Welcome again to Ocean Month. If you have questions, just ask.\nWhen we say ‚ÄúVekllei,‚Äù we most often think of the Home Island, the city-state to which the country owes its name. In practice, however, the state of Vekllei is portioned between many far-flung corners of the Atlantic Ocean. From tropical jungles and dry wine-making country to mossy woodlands and arctic deserts, ‚ÄúVekllei‚Äù as a singular concept is obfuscated by its diversity of land and people, and better represents a coalition of disparate Atlantic states than a single, centralised city-state.\nMake no mistake, however ‚Äî the power is held in the Home Island, where the vast majority of Vekllei‚Äôs people live and work. Her autonomous, satellite regions are indulged and supported as any borough of the Home Island, but these islands (and they are, invariably, islands) are often small, isolated and of little economic value. What makes them special is that they are populated with vibrant, unique peoples and cultures of considerable history, and are retained for precisely that fact ‚Äî their cultural benefit for a city-state that considers itself a representative of indigenous Atlantic people; a ‚Äúthird power‚Äù between the hegemonies of Europe and America.\nThis map depicts these places ‚Äî ‚Äúoverseas territories‚Äù is what Vekllei calls them ‚Äî as well as their exclusive economic zones (EEZs), outlined in white. Let‚Äôs take the opportunity to have a brief look at some of Vekllei‚Äôs most unique and distant regions.\n Kala, or Greenland, is Vekllei‚Äôs ‚Äúsister land‚Äù. Many of the indigenous Arctic people who first settled Vekllei nearly six thousand years ago crossed from or lived in Kala. The massive glacial island is self-governing, and has its own regional parliament, but is otherwise a possession of Vekllei. Its largest city, Nusc, reveals just how antagonist Kala remains towards it inhabitants ‚Äî just 250,000 people live there, compared to nearly 2.4 millions in Vekllei‚Äôs largest borough, Vekllei Proper. Pack a jacket! Demon, or Jan Mayen, is a tiny volcanic satellite island and full overseas territory of Vekllei. It has the smallest population of any overseas province, at just 15,600 people, who live in its only town ‚Äî Skismi. As an overseas territory, it receives daily postal service and full entitlements of any Vekllei person, mostly by way of flying boats and hydrofoils. Aismious Isles, or the Faroe Islands, are an archipelago of charming people mostly descended from Arctic Vekllei (indigenous Algic people) and early Irish settlers, known for their seafood diets and provinciality. There‚Äôs a lot going on in the world, and the people of the Aismious Isles don‚Äôt want to know about it ‚Äî or at least, that‚Äôs the consensus. For this reason, it‚Äôs popular as the ‚Äúthinking man‚Äôs retreat‚Äù from society, as opposed to traditional holiday locales like the Azores. Speaking of the Azores, these islands are unique ‚Äî while self-governing, they are structured more like a Bureau than a democracy. Two governments exist there at once ‚Äî the Azores Holiday Government, which maintains infrastructure that enables nearly a million Vekllei people to vacation there each year, and the Mira Regional Council, its neighbour and electorate to which locals cast their ballots. This has, historically, made them very cranky. Mira, or Madeira, is situated off the coast of Africa and is one of the few places in Vekllei that requires special permits to visit. It is both heavily protected as a wildlife reserve and a major naval port for the Royal Vekllei Armed Forces at Sumi, its largest city. As is encouraged throughout Vekllei, people here live the way they have for hundreds of years, just more quietly. Kalina Isles, made up of many islands of the Lesser Antilles, are a tropical archipelago of hundreds of small islands, many of which are unpopulated. Like Kala, the Kalina Isles are self-governing, and while its old colonial towns and indigenous Caribbean culture may not at first appear ‚ÄúVekllei‚Äù, you‚Äôll find their relaxed lifestyles and deep appreciation for landscape unite them in spirit with all Vekllei territories, from the Home Island to Demon. Vekllei Antarctic Territories are, somehow, more isolated in feeling than her Lunar cities. During the late 2050s, when sovereignty started to be enforced in the antarctic, Vekllei retained its claim by encouraging domestic tourism to the South Pole. On the coast, an airport services a civilian city called Desma of hotels and commerce, which is marked by the dramatic, hostile desert that surrounds it. The further inland you go, the less accessible the settlements become, finally arriving at the military/scientific Polar Station at the South Pole. Vekllei Lunar Territories are, through the miracle of our current age, accessible to the average Vekllei person. This fact is one of the great sources of pride Vekllei people feel toward their country, and many visit at least once. Moidonnet, or ‚ÄúMoon City‚Äù, is one of only a handful of lunar settlements open to the public, and is unique in its accessibility to the people of its home country. Some 45,000 people live there semi-permanently, taking calcium pills to keep their bones healthy, under the large glass domes of the city. Many more visit ‚Äî and are left with the memories of a lifetime, and the humbling experience of gazing upon our small blue planet from above.  It is clear, then, that Vekllei‚Äôs conceptual and political bias towards its northern territories is misleading, since ‚Äî at least domestically ‚Äî isolation and island living is a foundational aspect of how Vekllei people understand themselves. Although someone from Mira might at first be a novelty to a person of the Home Islands, it very soon becomes apparent that Mira is, in fact, Vekllei ‚Äî its weather might be warmer, and its people might look different, but their lives are very similar, premised on gentle living and Vekllei‚Äôs complex metaphysics of landscape. That is what it means to be ‚ÄúVekllei,‚Äù no matter where you are in the Atlantic.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-03-10-commonwealth/","title":"Vekllei‚Äôs Sprawling Commonwealth"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article was part of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Ocean Month in March 2021  ‚ùñ Note from the Editor Although vessels described here are written with female pronouns as per Western convention, Vekllei traditionally uses male pronouns for navy vessels.  Nuclear Heavy Battlecruiser V.V. Lava is the first of the Lava-class cruisers, the largest of Vekllei‚Äôs surface warships. Vekllei doctrine does not typically float cruisers with fleets, and so the Lava often operates independently, outfitted for a variety of roles. She can be sailed into any storm-ravaged port and hook up to the local electric grid, powering tens of thousands of homes with her enormous molten salt fission reactor. She is equipped for both fire support and assault. 5 large guns of 50-100mm calibers crater the shore as missiles, torpedoes and lasers of various types fight off threats from the air and sea. She is even equipped for beach assaults and boarding, with 6 assault boats and 5 helijets available to offload hundreds of maritime commandos, which are deployed frequently in Vekllei‚Äôs ongoing fight against illegal fishing. Her multipurpose mission is reflected in the visibility of her superstructure, which boasts heliports, vertical launch systems, rack missiles, and heavy guns.\nHere, she enters the world‚Äôs largest marine railway in the port town of Cisadra. As she sits in the water here, her sailors have disembarked and her helijets are preparing to relocate as thousands of tons of ballast is pumped into a treatment facility. Once her weight is reduced to a mere 25,000 tonnes, she will be chained to the massive marine railway ‚Äòcradle‚Äô ‚Äî the supports and bed on which she sits ‚Äî and slowly pulled by massive nuclear winches into the shallow water of the Cisadra Shipyards, a naval facility owned by the Royal Vekllei Armed Forces.\nThis marine railway is the largest of its kind, and was unfathomably expensive to build. The Navy of Vekllei maintains a naval station in the Lesser Antilles to support strategic nuclear sites it retains on the Kalina Islands, and large-scale dredging and dock construction was deemed unsuitable for the sorts of harbours common to the area. Although a number of ideas, including a floating shipyard were hypothesised, the Cisadra Marine Railway was built after the success Vekllei had with similar systems in the Home Islands.\nRead on for a little more information on the Kalina Islands.\nThe Kalina Islands (made up of Anguilla, St Martin, St Kitts \u0026amp; Nevis, Montserrat, Antigua and Barbuda) are an autonomous overseas territory of Vekllei, structured as a self-managing dependent state similar to Kala (Greenland) and the Aismious Islands (Faroe). Although their origins are colonial, today they are a full overseas state of Vekllei with the same entitlements and voting rights as any Home Islands Borough. They remain autonomous in internal policy, similar to a provincial government, and across their hundreds of tropical islands there are some 350,000 people, all of them holding both Vekllei and Kalina citizenship.\nThe Kalina Islands were purchased from the Spanish in the 17th century, and indicated Vekllei‚Äôs initial intention to exploit the New World. This ambition was scuppered with the collapse of the Vekllei monarchy, which established forts across them but could not muster the resources to occupy continental America. Vekllei‚Äôs colonial efforts were blunted for centuries after, and excluded the country from major participation in the slave trade and the colonisation of Africa.\nThis leaves the Kalina Islands, named after its native peoples, in a peculiar position as both a legacy of the early colonial period while also remaining home to the only major populations of Island Carib people (Kalinago) left in the world. On adjacent overseas territories, like the British Virgin Islands and Guadaloupe, they died out from murder and disease ‚Äî but through the sheer failure of Vekllei‚Äôs colonial policy, they live on as an association of island territories in the 21st Century.\nDespite being thousands of kilometres apart with dramatically different cultures and climates, both the Home and Kalina Islands remain ‚ÄúVekllei‚Äù by way of their ancient cultures, maritime histories and moneyless bureau system. In this sense, the success and prosperity of the Kalina Islands reestablish what ‚ÄúVekllei‚Äù is ‚Äî where once it meant the indigenous people of the Arctic North, today it represents a coalition of Atlantic territories united in their dependence on landscape and economic systems. If the Kalina Islands were to become independent, it is likely little would change ‚Äî their centuries of history with the Home Islands have cemented a desire for landscape sovereignty and postindustrial localism, and along with Kala and the Aismious, Vekllei has forged an alternative way of living for indigenous Atlantic peoples caught between the hungry machines of America and Europe.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-03-06-marine/","title":"The Marine Railway"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Lin Zhi was nuts. She was lovely, but she was nuts. Tzipora followed along, pleading occasionally, a squeaking voice of concern.

Zhi told Tzipora she was the great-great-granddaughter of a hero of the communist party, who‚Äôd fought with Mao Tse-tung himself over a century ago.

Tzipora liked her and feared her, perhaps because she saw herself in Zhi‚Äôs frequent outbursts of anger and principled view of the world.\nThe Floral Period was stuffed with new citizens, many of them in disfavour of the politics of their home country. Many of them came from Asia ‚Äî Ayn‚Äôs father was a Hong Konger, and Jiro was from Tokyo. Vekllei‚Äôs people were indigenously ‚ÄúAsiatic in appearance,‚Äù as Europe called them. Most were descended from a mixture of Arctic peoples and Irish or Scandinavian settlers. To this end, Vekllei‚Äôs complicated ethnic makeup contributes to the country‚Äôs obscurity from the U.S. and Europe, as they tend to be orientalised outside of Western concern. This discrimination does not stop Vekllei people from maintaining ignorant ideas towards its incoming East Asian and South-East Asian migrants, however, and people like Zhi often had to deal with racist abuse in public and in private.\n‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we be smart about this?‚Äù Tzipora asked, upset. ‚ÄúWhat he did to you is against school policy.

She shook her head and tossed the bat at Tzipora‚Äôs feet.\n‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBecause I like you, Zelda, that‚Äôs all. Don‚Äôt tell him anything. Don‚Äôt tell anyone anything.

Moise always had a temper, and now he had a reputation. He got no words of sympathy from the other seniors of Lola 8th School.\nConsidering his bluntness and irritability, it was funny that he could only make good friends with women. His father was a bastard and his mother was in Greece, so his sister took their place. His closest friend was Tzipora, the boyish miracle child who helped him lose weight. His love was Coretti, his high school sweetheart and, a little further along, his wife.\nCoretti was the daughter of Congolese scientists, but was born and raised in the Soviet Union. She had a typical brief for Afro-Russians ‚Äî her father had worked with the Congo Water Company, and later was brought over for the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and Food. She spent her early years in the relative wealth of the Basmanny District.\nThe arrangement collapsed quickly after the coup in Congo and the death of Party Secretary Shchusev. The office her father worked for disappeared, and the family emigrated to Vekllei when she was six. Vekllei was full of displaced people with displaced heritage.

Domestic stamps do not show a price in Vekllei Kroner, and generally do not use the Vekllei hieroglyph to announce its origin.  We can deduce that the stamps pictured above are all domestic stamps used for sending mail to other Vekllei people, regardless of whether they live in Antarctica, Vekllei‚Äôs lunar colonies or anywhere in-between.\nStamps are valuable records of their time, particularly as memories of celebration. You can learn a lot about a place and what it values by looking at its stamps.\nLet‚Äôs take a look at some of Vekllei‚Äôs domestic postage stamps from the last few years. From the top left:\n 2063 marked the launch of the third generation of Vekllei rocket booster since independence in 2015. The introduction of these boosters, spaced evenly across the postwar decades, marked eras in themselves for Vekllei‚Äôs extraterrestrial ambitions. By the 2060s, most metals were mined off-world, marking one of the greatest weapons for peace in the atomic era ‚Äî vast new worlds of untapped resources. This particular postage stamp was released as part of a set celebrating Vekllei rocketry, including recent expeditions to planetoids on the very periphery of our solar system. Puffins are the national bird and appear everywhere. You can see why ‚Äî they‚Äôre pretty birds and very common in Vekllei. They are popularly circulated on stamps in a variety of styles simply because people like to see them when sending and receiving mail. This stamp may look abstract at first, but is actually a message in Vekllei Semaphore. Green and gold represent nature and living blood, which alternated like this usually refers to natural chaos. But there‚Äôs more to it ‚Äî this striping pattern, called a sunburst in Vekllei hieroglyphs, refers to the sun, and can mean warmth. These swooping white lines mean purity, or delicateness, and those patterned squares are used for the borders of announcements from the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office. So can you guess what this stamps says? It‚Äôs announcing Vekllei‚Äôs success in the Olympics in skiing, of course. Vekllei Semaphore is rarely straightforward ‚Äî it has a thousand quirks built over a thousand years. Speaking of the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office, this is Ms. Prime Minister Jo Sismiosnah, one of two Prime Ministers in the country. Atomic weaponry is a fact of life in the 2060s, and Vekllei has a complex psychological relationship with nukes as both a victim and retainer of nuclear weapons. It is also the only country in the world to have detonated nuclear weapons for a cultural purpose. This stamp depicts such a detonation. In the absurdity of the Royal Mail Press, antinuclear stamps are also produced simultaneously, depicting white doves urging world leaders to denuclearise. This flower, called a Lava Rose, is common to the Lumiousniyah region on the West of the country. Not by coincidence, its chromacode is destined for Copette. Vekllei retains a great many nuclear icebreakers to keep shipping traffic moving in and out of its Northern regions. The country depends heavily on foreign shipping for its bizarre peripheral markets and such icebreakers are often celebrated on stamps. This is Vekllei‚Äôs lovely agricultural belt throughout its rich volcanic interior, specifically based off Kyala‚Äôs wheat fields. By no coincidence, its chromacode is destined for Kyala. Finally, we see a celebration of Anglo-Vekllei relations in the post-occupation period. Although historical tensions will linger for many generations more, and disputes over fishing rights in the Atlantic continue to threaten friendly relations, Vekllei is very keen in a political context to celebrate the diplomatic successes achieved with the U.K. since occupation, and you‚Äôll find the U.K. generally overrepresented on Vekllei‚Äôs ‚Äòforeign‚Äô domestic stamps.  Now that‚Äôs a lot of stamp facts! Before we go, Tzipora has just a couple of words on starting your own stamp collection:\n NEVER PEEL STAMPS. Cut them off the envelope and soak it in water for an hour or so, until it separates freely. Dry your stamps on a tea towel. Press them with books so they don‚Äôt curl. Keep your stamps safe by keeping them in an album, preferably. Share your stamps. Stamps are meant to be shared, so never be afraid to trade your boring Vekllei stamps to some friendly Soviet or American for theirs.  That‚Äôs all for now. We‚Äôve got one more post left in ‚ÄúMail Week‚Äù (more like Mail Month at this rate), before we head off to something new. It‚Äôs going to be very exciting!\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-02-16-stamps/","title":"Philately Foolery"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article was part of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Mail Week in February 2021  The Stamp Manufacturie of the Royal Mail Press, located on 5th Avenue, churns millions of stamps a year out of its massive drum presses. Stamps are used on mail instead of postcodes, and as payment for the international and courier work the Royal Mail does abroad. Since Vekllei does not use money domestically, Vekllei people do not pay for postage and stamps are used in the automatic sorting system to determine the destination for any Vekllei territory, including its arctic, peripheral and antarctic possessions.\nThe main factory, seen here, is an original Newda building in the simple, postwar style common in the time it was built. The street and loading area it looks over is actually just one part of the Royal Mail headquarter complex, and the surrounding city blocks have slowly been claimed for the Mail‚Äôs singular mission: reliable post for Vekllei people, anywhere in the world. In the background, the Mail Tower, so it‚Äôs called, punctuates the mid-rise skyline of the Capital. The tower is actually a vestigial artefact of a military telecommunications facility, now home to the Mail‚Äôs Office of Telecommunications.\nAt street level, pedestrians can take lunch at the Royal Mail Press Cafeteria, tour the Royal Vekllei Philatelic Museum, or take a monorail to the Royal Mail Post Office General, where the organisation is administrated. Like many State Requisite manufacturers, these facilities are available to the public via tours, which make common day trips for the unburdened Vekllei worker/holidaymaker.\nLet‚Äôs take a closer look at why the The First Post Office of the Royal Vekllei Mail looks the way it does.\nVekllei has throughout much of its history evolved outside of Western rationalism, and this incurs all sorts of peculiarities in its public life, not least of which its affection for the perceptual, affective, natural and other unsentimental artefacts of pre-rational thought. For Vekllei people, art is just the decoration of ordinary life. In architecture, this is catastrophic; buildings in Vekllei are not ‚Äúprojects,‚Äù and they have no ‚Äúsubject‚Äù that centres its design. This has resulted in the bizarre manifestation of a sort of postwar postmodernism, rooted in Upen and valorised by Vekllei Metaphysics, in which informal poststructural utopianism is projected onto the objects ‚Äî in this case, buildings and factories ‚Äî of ordinary life.\nVekllei modernism is basically utopian. Not utopian in the way this whole project is; as a peculiar expression of being ‚Äî but utopian in its unabashed projection of texture and emotion in place of an authentic art-form. Newda is utopian in the sense that buildings are not art-objects, and they serve a rational purpose agnostic to subjectivity. Newda is also unsentimental, as art is merely the decoration of ordinary life in Vekllei, not dissimilar to language or cooking. It is obvious, then, that architecture and art have been separated intentionally in Vekllei.\nNewda is the face of this cultural legacy, and despite its poststructural origins, is deeply modernist in appearance. It is styled in the instinct of the postwar period, as symbolic of recovery and wealth. It gives very little concern to imitation of past styles or structural gimmicks ‚Äî it prioritises geometry, cleanliness, ‚Äúthe human face‚Äù (meaning original human construction; not biomimicry) and dependence on place. Although influenced by experiments in modernism in France and the United States, it is mostly indigenous and isolationist today, as the rest of the world rumbles amidst yet another crisis of architecture.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-02-11-manufacturie/","title":"The Stamp Manufacturie"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Hello,\nI‚Äôm Hobart, and I‚Äôm the creator of this place.

It was the first week of sleepless nights; the windows thrown open, air sticky and pungent with the smells of the rainforests, tossing and turning in the heat.\nA stab of panic shot through her as she woke, bleary-eyed and senseless, to the quiet bedside clock. She blinked a couple of times before the terror set in. She‚Äôd overslept ‚Äî 08:32 ‚Äî but critically, the Travelling Post Office left at 8:30. Shit, shit shit.\nMaybe, just maybe, she could run to the next station and catch it when it stopped to offload the grocer‚Äôs produce.\nLying atop damp sheets, she rolled out of bed and made a racket on the wooden floor of her house, wiping her eyes as she looked for her friend‚Äôs package. She flew out the front door moments later in the shorts and tee shirt she‚Äôd slept in, raking a sandal across the gravel as she landed awkwardly. It was usually a fifteen minute walk to the station, so she ran as fast as she could, the package bouncing off her leg painfully as she took off down the drive. Warm raindrops started to hit the dirt around her.\nAs she rounded the corner where the dirt track met paved path, she met it ‚Äî the No. 76 Mail Train, closing in from behind. The mist had rolled in and the hot rain was belting down. No. 76 was going to overtake her ‚Äî but she still might catch it before it departed. This was going to be close.\n Mail Trains, or Rail Post Offices, are a common sight in Vekllei once you leave the dense urban infrastructure of its coastal cities behind. The further you venture into Vekllei‚Äôs dramatic, tendril-like mountain ranges and igneous valleys, the smaller towns become. Some, like Montre-Lola, had their post offices closed long ago, and today are served by a series of travelling post offices that run along the ubiquitous web of commuter rail lines in the country. The advantages are obvious; one train, running along a single line, can service six or seven towns in a morning.\nThey pull into a siding, usually the platform of the local station in quiet towns, and wait for fifteen minutes or so to allow for the loading and unloading of mail. They can also perform duties of regular post offices, like the renewal of identification and travel booking, as long as you phone ahead.\nModern Mail Trains are typically based on the Series 225 EMU in 2-car configurations. These are modern locomotives with electric motors in each car, allowing the 225 (known as the RM Series in its Mail Train configuration) to easily run along Vekllei‚Äôs old interior rail lines, which have steep gradients and tight curves. The exception is the Siviouscopet de Desmisnion, or Ambassador of the Postmistress, a special mail-sorting train based on the 6-car Series 4000 trainset that operates between the Capital and Montre. The Ambassador is particularly special, since it houses a fully furnished office available to the Postmistress General for her use in running the Royal Vekllei Mail.\nTzipora here has encountered the simple adventures of rural living; navigating the friendly bureaucracy of her government from small towns long since forgotten in common memory.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-02-05-mailtrain/","title":"Racing the Post Office to the Station"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article was part of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Mail Week in February 2021  The M.S. Fairie Model 54-2 ‚ÄúMail Hopper‚Äù is a strange aircraft. The basic design has remained unchanged for over a hundred years, imported from the United States way back during the massive scrapping of junk warplanes after the Second World War. Even back during the Junta years the country had little respect for foreign intellectual property, and by 1949 had started rolling out Imitation Catalinas, which were among the first indigenous aircraft in the country. A hundred years on, the Fairie is still being developed and produced, its most recent version rolling out in 2054.\nThe Government Aircraft Factories (the actual name of the organisation and design bureau is literally ‚ÄúGovernment Aircraft Manufacturie‚Äù) produce military aircraft for Vekllei‚Äôs armed forces. And since the Royal Mail is technically a military organisation, Mail vehicle contracts are furnished by the government arms merchants of the country.\nWhile keeping the same basic form and fuselage of the ancient Catalinas, the Fairie has been thoroughly overhauled inside and out. The twin props have been replaced by low-power Sami S.p.M. electric pulse jets raised high off the seas to keep salt water out, which are angled slightly downwards. Though inefficient at the sorts of altitudes the Fairie flies at, they are much quieter than turbofans and better suited for slow flying, benefitting the low-speed gliding tendencies of the aircraft. The aircraft is smaller overall than its predecessors, with a redesigned tail and wingspan that lower the Fairie‚Äôs stall speed.\nVekllei has many islands, and more emerge all the time. This is a violently volcanic country after all, and after a day of churning seawater whole new landmasses can appear off the coast. The archipelago communities of these landmasses are often serviced by light flying boat aircraft like the Fairie. Some of them, like this one here, are seaplanes exclusively and have no landing gear (the ‚Äú-2‚Äù of its designation refers to this omission). Others, especially those assigned to the arctic, are equipped with skis.\nThe Mail retains fourteen Fairies across the Home Islands, and a further six across the Azores, Aismious (Faroe Islands) and Kala (Greenland). To the people they service, these planes represent much more than the arrival of the mail ‚Äî they are a direct gesture of the mother Vekllei state; a reminder they are not forgotten by the Crown Metropole, and a pipeline to friends and relatives across oceans. These pilots are among the luckiest in the world, flying superbly engineered aircraft, refined over a century, across some of the most striking lands and oceans on Earth.\nBonus: a much larger Vekllei aircraft built by the Comen Aeroyards.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-02-03-fairie/","title":"The Fairie"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article was part of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Mail Week in February 2021  Here we have arranged the highest-ranking and lowest-ranking members of the Royal Vekllei Mail (Mail A.r.). On the left is an Office Postgirl, a precursory position tasked with distributing letters in the sprawling bureau complexes abundant in the centralised postwar period. This particular employee is Aleja Hern√°ndez, who has decided she‚Äôd rather deliver mail than spend another year studying for high school exit exams. Mail runs in her blood ‚Äî her father, a Dominican, is stationed abroad in service of the Royal Mail‚Äôs Cuba Office with her mother, a native of the country. They‚Äôll be abroad until the Spring, and by the time they get back they expect Aleja to have found full-time work with the Mail. She wears a baggy smock to keep ink and dirt off her uniform. Here, she represents a common intern of the organisation, tasked with menial and uninteresting work for a few weeks as she‚Äôs trained to be a proper Postwoman.\nThe difference between someone like Aleja and the Acting General Postmistress is the Postmistress does not spill letters all over the hallway.\nThe current General Postmistress of the country is Sious Desmesneh, who stands here beside Aleja. At 32, she is the youngest Postmistress in Vekllei‚Äôs history. She is also among the most cunningly ambitious people currently employed by the Mail, and scandalously usurped her immediate superiors to inherit the role after the passing of Postmaster John Iousasmor, a shock promotion formalised by a landslide company ballot in May last year.\nIt is only appropriate that she ascended via coup, since the Postmaster General is a de jure military rank, equivalent to an Admiral in the navy. The Mail is a State Requisite, not a military organ, but it retains a formal military leadership and ranked hierarchy from its origins as a military communications organ many centuries ago. Although a military ‚ÄúGeneral,‚Äù Sious has no actual military powers and serves less exotically as a de facto director of the Mail A.r. She wears the Postmistress‚Äôs uniform, complete with traditional Vekllei floral plate and round heismious hat.\nFinally, the flag of the Royal Mail is depicted above Aleja. Most bureau-sized organisations in Vekllei have their own flags, as part of Vekllei semaphore, and the Mail Flag is flown alongside the domestic and regional standards outside every post office in the country.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-02-02-postmistress/","title":"The Postmistress of Vekllei"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article was part of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Mail Week in February 2021  There are not many postal services older than the Royal Vekllei Mail. It is so old that in the Vekllei language its title is simply ‚ÄòMail‚Äô ‚Äî the ‚ÄòRoyal‚Äô and ‚ÄòVekllei‚Äô are implied by the use of its hieroglyph. Founded in 1422 as part of the military communications system between government and mercantile government holdings, it has survived various restructurings ‚Äî and several wars ‚Äî to remain a critical communications and cultural institution today.\nAs is the usual way with State Requisites (A.r.), the (Royal Vekllei) Mail maintains a state monopoly on all paper and electric mail in the country, serviced by a workforce of nearly fifty thousand people and two hundred thousand automen. Peculiarly, telephones, telegrams and videophones are structured under the Mail as the Mail Bureau Office of Telecommunications, which acts as an independent organ of the Mail A.r.\nVekllei people send nearly 12 million letters a day ‚Äî that‚Äôs about one for every two people, and the Mail processes and delivers another 40 million mail pieces a day. It does this with a fleet of jets, automatic trucks, dedicated mail trains, intercity pneumatic systems, vehicle automen, and postmen, all wearing the red and gold colours of the organisation. It previously served the King of Vekllei, during the years of monarchy, and today serves the Royal (Land) Sovereign ‚Äî the confusing name for the landscape of Vekllei and its potential for human use. It is de facto bound by the Petticoat constitution of the Floral Period.\nVekllei people love their Mail, as a patriotic analogy for the unity of the city-state. Red postboxes are visible on every street in city boroughs, and in the country Post Offices serve as critical contact points for communities isolated from urban business. The announcing of the Mail‚Äôs Postmaster General is a deeply ceremonial affair, second only to the ascension of new Prime Ministers. Vekllei was home to the world‚Äôs first Postmistress General, Mi Miou, in 2016 shortly after independence.\nIt is only appropriate that the Universal Postal Union, the U.N. body responsible for the worldwide mail treaty coordinating international postage, is headquartered in Vekllei‚Äôs Capital district, two blocks away from the Mail‚Äôs luxurious Newda head post office and administration complex. As one of the oldest of Vekllei‚Äôs ancient, evolving state institutions it perhaps best symbolises the age and service of the Vekllei state to its people.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-02-01-mail/","title":"The Men and Women of the Royal Mail in Vekllei"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  She joined the Puffin Scouts to make friends. Tzipora was not especially rugged or outdoorsy, but she was a fresh patriot, and the idea of collecting awards for conservation, in her mind, was much like Baron collecting medals for killing reds in the War.\nThe green and gold of the Puffin Scouts represent nature and living blood respectively. Entwined, as here on her scarf, they mean the chaos and inhumanity of nature in Vekllei Semaphore. Puffin Scout troops are based out of a region with a Kronaismioudelfia (Crown Land), which are abandoned wild areas the Vekllei state has relinquished to the natural spirits worshiped in Upen. Hikes aren‚Äôt done in Crown Lands because if someone gets hurt or goes missing it can be very difficult to get them out.\nThese wildernesses captured Tzipora‚Äôs imagination, since they are often the site of gods and extranatural features. The animals you saw out there seemed deeply disturbed by the presence of people, as though they were the vessels of spirits, irritated that a human girl had made her way in.\nSchool-aged Puffin Scouts are called Pufflings. In Vekllei, puffin birds are as common as gulls, and nest in cliffs where they raise their young in burrows. Tzipora, despite being a Puffling, never had much luck with puffins. They seemed to exempt her from their natural friendliness and curiosity ‚Äî they flew away whenever she came close, and when they didn‚Äôt fly away they attacked her. She joined the Puffin Scouts to make friends, and yet here she was, cast out from both the Human and Animal Kingdoms.\nIn this picture, Tzipora watches a puffin in full scout regalia, wary of its intent. The birds make cute novelties for some, but Tzipora knows better. Just like Baron in the war, she sits still and watches closely, listening for movement on the wind.

It had long lost its walls, but its florid green belt disguised a complex network of trenches, tunnels and forts that linked emplacements in the surrounding mountains. Together, these systems would ensure Vekllei would never again have to tolerate occupation by a foreign power. Lava was on the outskirts of Vekllei‚Äôs great capital city, and much of its cityscape was dispersed, affording residents a slower pace of life.\nAbove Lava‚Äôs commercial heart were its terraced hills, and from up there you could see the canal ferries wind their way through the city. At the edge of a terraced park sits a bench full of memories.\nAlthough Tzipora looked the same as ever, she was 20 now. Cobian was nearly 18, and considering more sincerely her future. She cared about what other people thought of her. To that end they were always worlds apart. Tzipora was driven by a self-sustaining obsessive intuition, not the advice of her peers. Her imitation of ordinary teen-age life was usually misguided and clumsy. She had never made a good teenager ‚Äî a good much of anything, really. But she was a very good Tzipora.\nEven now, Tzipora didn‚Äôt really think of herself as a homosexual, in the same way she didn‚Äôt consider herself a girl who wore glasses despite the near-sighted prescription specs she kept in her purse. After all, as she liked to say, there was nothing sexy about her ‚Äî a good Catholic education and a miracle prepubescence saw to that. In the prejudice of the time, that‚Äôs what it meant to be a homosexual, at least to her. So this relationship ‚Äî whatever it was ‚Äî was not really that. She could avoid public judgement and her own ongoing prejudices if she simply pretended like her sincere feelings for Cobian did not amount to homosexuality.\nTzipora was a funny person, capable of great emotional maturity and immaturity depending on her environs. With Baron, she was serious and independent. With Cobian, she was energetic and overeager. Cobian was in no such turmoil about her preference of partner, and unlike Tzipora she was becoming an adult woman capable of exploring a serious, adult relationship. She would grow older and older, and Tzipora would stay there, same as ever. They both knew it was coming. Tzipora was not a child, but she was also not exactly an adult either ‚Äî she was Tzipora, and she would be Tzipora for as long as she lived, much as she was now.\nTzipora didn‚Äôt generally talk about her feelings, but Cobian was very good at it. They travelled to the terraced park from Lola, and found the bench they‚Äôd visited years prior as junior high school students. Back then they‚Äôd seen a film at the State Cinema in town and walked for a while after, just talking about it. They‚Äôd ended up here, as night fell, and talked until the early morning. Maybe it was a date; maybe it was their first date ‚Äî what constituted a date with Tzipora? Their relationship was much the same as it had ever been, just with the knowledge they loved each other. But what a revelation that had been. Tzipora had cried when she told her. Tzipora did not cry about much but gestures of affection always overwhelmed her.\nToday they sat on that bench again and talked, and they talked for a long while. What will you study? What will we do? What will Tzipora do for the rest of her life ‚Äî is she destined to drift from person to person, parasitically enjoying their friendship until they aged out of her reach? Where would Cobian live? What would Tzipora like to do for a living? Will they always be friends, and love each other?\nYes, they both agreed, they would always be friends, and they would always love each other.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-01-23-love/","title":"Moments in Love"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  The Vekllei word for a robot is automasiosn, or ‚Äòautoman‚Äô. When we talk about Vekllei being a ‚Äúpost-scarcity society,‚Äù it is by automen through which it happens. They are found across the entire country in all types of hard and boring work, forever dutiful, forever mindless. It is not that the robot has replaced the human worker, since about 90% of Vekllei people are employed. Instead, the automan takes its place in the necessary evils of industrial society, fulfilling the wildest fantasies of utopian industrialists; the factory is no longer just the place of the machine, it is in fact a machine itself.\nWhen we talk about Vekllei ‚Äúdeindustrialising,‚Äù it is by automen through which it happens. They are neither alive nor entirely synthetic, and work to maintain the basic comforts of consumer society in secret, as the Vekllei state moves towards total deregulation of the human life experience. The more they produce, the further Vekllei people are pushed away from modernity.\nAutomen better resemble automatic machines than a synthetic person; the vast majority of them are bespoke products integrated into infrastructure for a specific purpose. Some are hidden in plain sight ‚Äî the automatic train control, the system which closes and cleans public lavatories, and telephone switchboards are all operated by automen. They don‚Äôt think like a human does, because they are manufactured, not born.\nThe activity of the robot brain, called mind-genesis, emerges from artificial substrates of crystal (called command clocks) linked by vat-grown brain tissue, which organically process commands delivered by a computer. Most commands for a robot are sensory, and utilise the brain‚Äôs natural instinct for balance and orientation in processing. Most robot brains in Vekllei are completely engineered, but are based on mapped sections of ape brains and grown in pluripotent stem cell vats in an immersion fluid.\nCommand clocks are produced in superheated ovens that are then submerged in an ionised liquid. These wafers, called ‚Äúcookies‚Äù, are manufactured out of tetrachalcogenic materials that support ‚Äúcartographic‚Äù (as opposed to ‚Äúchaotic‚Äù) crystal pathways. Early robots used tridymite, which occurs naturally in Vekllei, but almost all robots today use synthetic crystal (usually quartz) grown in hydrothermal crystal plants.\nThe tissue and command clocks are knitted together in what is basically an incredibly precise and expensive sewing machine, connecting the command clocks to their electrical components and the clocks to the living tissue by way of an axon gun. The result is a device with instincts, dumb and unthinking but highly sensitive and adaptive to inputs. When coupled with other modules, like sensor lasers, automen are able to navigate independently of programmed instruction sets. Since most of their programming and memory are offloaded, they are also relatively inexpensive compared to early overseas models.\nVery few automen in Vekllei are functionally independent, since robotic independence requires complex and expensive command processing computational and control units. Since the vast majority of automen operate in logistics or manufacturing industries, they are usually slaved to a facility Master Computer, which offloads most processing. In the case of maintenance and infrastructure, Master Computers may be consolidated into a region-wide single supercomputer, called an Automatic Asset Command.\nThis picture shows Tzipora socialising with a school maintenance robot, primarily used for vacuuming floors clean. It is connected to its Master Computer via cabling that runs in rails across the interior of the school, since radios are common enough here to interfere with communication between the automan and its computer. Behind her, a service automen used for crowd control, announcements and communication tells her to stop making friends with the maintenance droid. Incidents like these are common enough, and modern automens have security features to prevent vandalism and self-report damage.\nA final question remains ‚Äî if Vekllei has entered post-scarcity using robots, why does the rest of the world not simply replicate them? The simple answer is that they do, and the synthetic automan was not invented in Vekllei ‚Äî it was invented in Poland, and copied by West Germany. They are used world-over in manufacturing and industry. But Vekllei is unique in its heavy use of vehicle automen in public areas, for the simple fact that the economics of robotics just don‚Äôt make sense anywhere else in the world. Even in economies of scale, it is too expensive to grow a brain to replace human janitors, milkmen or refuse collectors. Automen demand enormous amounts of electricity, and require complex maintenance and special nutrient fuels to work. These expenses make sense in the contexts of sophisticated manufacturing, but don‚Äôt add up in unskilled work where they would be subject to vandalism and theft. In a world of dwindling resources and a rising tide of instability, the problem is much larger than a simple lack of automen or the fact that people must work ‚Äî a limit has been reached, and robots as we currently understand them will always be more expensive than human life.\nVekllei, in its soviet approach to science, sees these wonders of the atomic age wandering school halls, crushing shoes.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-01-11-automen/","title":"Robots in Vekllei"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  The New Year in Vekllei rings out during its months of darkness and cold. This calendar runs the regular affairs of the country, like it does the modern world. To Vekllei people, however, it is plain that New Years occurs not in darkness but instead in the summer solstice in June, the way it has for thousands of years in the dramatic cycles of light and dark in the country. In this sense, the end of December resonates among businesses and little else, much like the financial year elsewhere. An ancient pagan festival, one of twelve each year, takes its place in summer. This event is called Rascismion, or ‚ÄúRebirth of the Season‚Äù in the old Vekllei usage of the word ‚Äî meaning the complete cycle of seasons.\nAs a spiritual artefact of Upen, it is no surprise that the Solstice brings good luck and rebirth to Vekllei. It marks good fortune then, that the assembly and launch of the Desg met the Solstice, launching for Jupiter‚Äôs Europa just before midnight on June 21st, 2064. Constructed by the Solar Concern of the Vekllei Commonwealth Materials Bureau (or Solaburo) in cooperation with the Rocket Navy of the Vekllei Commonwealth Armed Forces and the Cosmos Office (or Cosmoburo), the Desg will land material on Europa to prepare for human arrival in six years. It is named after the Desg creatures of Vekllei mythology, who passed messages between malicious and benevolent factions of creatures before human settlement.\nAlthough it was nearly midnight, it was the Solstice and the sun would not set tonight. Ayn and Tzipora had spread out plates of Vekllei Kimisosyo stew across a blanket just south of the Lita Cosmodrome to watch the launch. The Royal Borough of Lita was not far from Copette (map of Vekllei here), one of the Five Crown Boroughs of Vekllei, but this was Vekllei‚Äôs glacial interior and it felt a million miles from anywhere. Its geography was ancient and violent, strikingly barren and brutally volcanic. Why visit Europa? It was alien enough here.\nAyn had brought her portable television. Baron was supposed to meet them there, but his train was delayed and he was stuck somewhere in Miyatvousi with the beer and fruit spritzers. Tzipora liked a drink, but Ayn liked it too much and had given it up years ago.\n‚ÄúI suppose it‚Äôs better than being drunk,‚Äù Tzipora said, nursing a fizzy drink.\n‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs not at all, Zelda‚Ä¶ Getting drunk feels great, that‚Äôs why I got drunk,‚Äù Ayn said. She was watching some teen-agers cuddling further down the hill, and sighed after a moment. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the trouble with it. A warm night like this, tired and with nothing to do? It‚Äôs the best feeling in the world. Let‚Äôs not kid ourselves.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI like wine,‚Äù Tzipora said stupidly before erring a moment later, embarrassed at how childish she sounded. ‚ÄúWell, you know. I drink alcohol, but not much. I like sweet things mostly.‚Äù\nAyn felt sorry for girl as the awkwardness of the conversation settled on Tzipora. It was worse to be self-aware, sometimes.\n‚ÄúBaron likes a drink,‚Äù Tzipora continued. ‚ÄúHe drinks a lot. He‚Äôs okay though, I don‚Äôt think he can get drunk. He‚Äôs a cool cucumber, he doesn‚Äôt change at all.‚Äù\n‚ÄúIs that right? Anyway, what time is it? It‚Äôll be launching soon.‚Äù\nAs the minutes ticked closer to launch, Tzipora began to fret that Baron wouldn‚Äôt make it. The New Year was very important to her.\nHe was out-of-breath and wrestling a crate of beer back under his arm as the distant boom of the atomic thrusters caught the mountaintops. He crested the hill as a dull roar invited the distant glitter of rocket engines that flickered out of the Lita Cosmodrome Launch Basin. He saw Ayn and Tzipora not far away and called to them, but they couldn‚Äôt hear him ‚Äî the Desg had called in the New Year, and all eyes were on it as it shined in the sky, brightest of all the stars. 2064 had became 2065, or Year 59 of the Floral Period.\nHappy New Year!\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2021-01-5-rocket/","title":"A New Year"},{"content":"","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/tags/2020/","title":"2020"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  There‚Äôs a thousand years of history in Vekllei‚Äôs armed forces, though you‚Äôll find very little of it recalled casually today. Almost everything about Vekllei‚Äôs prewar society was scorched by the bombs, and the scraps of military infrastructure that survived were appropriated in the subsequent British occupation.\nSince independence, a slate has been wiped clean, and a modern fighting force has replaced the colonial legions and battleships of yesteryear. Since reestablishment, Vekllei‚Äôs mettle has been tested in the jungles of Taiwan and the arctic deserts alike, and have proven themselves to be a rugged, versatile army of considerable bravery and fighting strength in spite of poor equipment in the bankruptcy of independence. Attached to British units in Taiwan and sent carelessly into dirty work, the Vekllei Army today has forged new prestige in the blood of its rebirth. Although Vekllei is an island nation, it maintains a large professional and conscripted army and is the third-largest contributor of personnel towards U.N. peacekeeping internationally.\nArmy Types Pictured here is a coalition of soldiers from different branches of the army. Let‚Äôs explore some of them now. Please note that this list is not comprehensive, and merely represents a portion of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s most common army branches.\nArmipor The Armipor (armi denporitsa, or army police), are a special branch of the secretive cross-bureau Military Intelligence Operations Council, which joins Vekllei‚Äôs sprawling espionage networks with its military infrastructure. The Armipor have many duties, including conventional military police-work, but may also engage in intelligence-gathering, counter-terrorism and rural policing work depending on the division.\nSomitzisma Somitzisma (meaning militia groups) are formal army units with training somewhere between active reservists and independent militias. Unlike reservists, they are not assigned uniforms and generally receive only periodic training. Their training focuses on a hypothetical home front, specialising in improvised warfare, urban combat and ambushes. They number some 2 million total, and represent one to the largest equipped militia forces in the world. This number would likely rapidly inflate during wartime due to high rates of firearm ownership in the country.\nMacka A ‚Äúmacka‚Äù is prewar Vekllei slang for a blunt tool or implement, and at some point during occupation and independence it became attached to Vekllei‚Äôs general infantry. Vekllei mackas number some 90,000 serving, and make up the bulk of Vekllei‚Äôs professionalised infantry. Mackas are reinforced by nearly a million active reservists, conscripted through Mandatory Service and equipped for defensive fighting. Their equipment varies dramatically, since they are trained for a variety of environments, including Vekllei‚Äôs warm southern climates and arctic warfare.\nCarasbine The Carasbine (commandos, derived from carbine), are Vekllei‚Äôs special forces. Broadly defined as any Vekllei army unit attached to unconventional forms of warfare (since counterterrorism and domestic paramilitary roles are served by the venopor), the country‚Äôs strategic focus on high-value and covert ops require a flexible fighting force. Although structured within Vekllei‚Äôs army hierarchy, their function has considerable latitude among divisions and often intersects with active operations planned and directed by the bureaus of National Intelligence. To this end, Vekllei maintains commandos trained for sabotage, hostage-rescue, special offensive action, combat diving, and manhunts. They often support and work alongside espionage agents of the NI bureaus.\nTzipora Tzipora does not have a gun and is not very good at killing the enemy and/or invading foreign nations.\nShe does, however, enlist in the Garden Corps for Mandatory Service and spends her military years growing flowers in street garden boxes, severely distracting any foreign invading force with their beauty.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-12-30-army/","title":"The Vekllei Army"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Pachinki is a world of Tzipora‚Äôs own creation, a dorky retreat from the difficulties she has in Vekllei. Tzipora always loved stories of wild places and adventure, and Pachinki blossomed organically from within her daydreams. Eventually she started writing and drawing it. When she was sad, bored or anxious, she would descend back into Pachinki‚Äôs world of ancient magic, edible gems and pirates.\nA chapter she wrote in late November one year resembled her idea of a Christmas story, and so I‚Äôve included a portion here to accompany this picture.\n She wrote,\nThis story starts with the tale of a young Pilot Witch, whose job was to guide dead aircraft to safe airports in the shaky peace that followed the Black War. It had to be female witches, since men couldn‚Äôt see the dead. She would meet formations of heavy bombers and strike fighters stuffed with corpses out at sea and show them the safe paths to the landing strips, flying low and fast where the Palace Gods couldn‚Äôt see them. This was the safe part of the job, since the Palace Gods and Necropirates ambushed out at sea, where they could hide between the archipelagos. Over land, they were mostly safe. It was an important job. Without the witch‚Äôs guidance, these planes would navigate the world forever, circling overhead, still packed with bombs.\nThe witches would guide the dead airmen down to the ground, where they could finally be relieved of their duty and released with proper burial rights. The planes would be repaired and flown back to the royal palace in Lily. This young witch was glad it was once again peacetime; when the empires warred, they couldn‚Äôt keep up with the dead planes.\nOnce, she was told to meet a special transport delegation out at sea. They didn‚Äôt explain anything more. She flew out to the coast on her broom and the glint of a wingtip caught her eye. As it approached, her instinct flared with alarm. These were not dead planes ‚Äî the crew in them were very much alive. She flew out and approached the largest aircraft in the formation, a transport bomber of a type she‚Äôd seen several times before. She landed atop the aircraft and made her way inside via a turret.\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù The witch asked, irritated at the break in procedure. The captain of the aircraft jumped at the noise, and straightened his shoulders as he addressed her pompously.\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here to guide us, are you? We‚Äôre from the Palace, in Lily.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI understand that; I saw your markings. But why‚Äôs it any of my business?‚Äù\n‚ÄúWhat do you mean, witch? We need safe passage, don‚Äôt we?‚Äù\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not my trade; what are you doing this far out? Do you have any idea how dangerous these archipelagos are?‚Äù\nThe captain snorted and resettled his cap.\n‚ÄúYou know what time of year it is, don‚Äôt you? All five planets are above us, silly girl.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThe other witches won‚Äôt like you coming in uninvited, I‚Äôll have you warned.‚Äù\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nearly the time for the festival. The Queen wants fine gifts for the Princess, and she won‚Äôt do with any old hat or dress. We‚Äôre part of a military attach√© that‚Äôs spent the last six months searching the lands for the finest gifts in the world.‚Äù\n‚ÄúGifts,‚Äù the witch said, betraying her surprise. ‚ÄúW-what sort of gifts?‚Äù\n‚ÄúWell, how about you head below deck and see for yourself. While you‚Äôre there, why don‚Äôt you pick something out? Provided we understand each other, of course.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWell, all right. Okay,‚Äù the witch said, and hurriedly turned away from the bridge.\nA few minutes later, the witch was once again atop her broom, though somewhat unevenly under the weight of the largest gem necklace she‚Äôd ever seen. She couldn‚Äôt believe her luck; it was laden with Soup Gems, and they hadn‚Äôt been seen around here in nearly a hundred years. You only found them growing in the stomachs of the Kemi people, and they had been wiped out many eons ago. A gem like this would produce excellent powders, and make her very powerful for a time.\nShe resettled her pilot‚Äôs hat, and placed both hands on her broomstick. She felt the wind swirl around her as she shot to the front of the formation.\n‚Äî\nThe witch depicted here looks awfully like Tzipora, and that‚Äôs no coincidence. Tzipora is always somewhere in her own stories. She writes herself in because she likes to imagine herself living among these people, flying on broomsticks and becoming a powerful witch.\nThese types of posts aren‚Äôt very regular, but they‚Äôre important for my health as an illustrator. Vekllei might be fantastical, but it‚Äôs a Cold War consumer society at the end of the day. Pachinki provides me (and Tzipora!) a fun holiday now and then, into a surreal world of planetoids and magic.\nLet me know if you have any questions. You can read other Pachinki posts (quite old now) here and here. Also here and here. And here. That‚Äôs all of them, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever done.

She now lived in a country that did not use money. Food was everywhere and you ate until you were satisfied. Around each corner was a new cinema or basement lounge, and water trickled through the streets like all mythic garden cities. It was a paradise.\nSomehow, despite her new wealth, a panic had set in. School hadn‚Äôt worked out and she lived parasitically with a person who hadn‚Äôt really expected or wanted to take her. Desperate to justify her presence as an immigrant, she started to cook ‚Äî first from the TV, then out of books. A year into her new life in utopia, she had the makings of a master home cook, serving hot suppers six days a week. On Sundays Baron made a roast.\nVekllei is the sort of place that rewards attention to common things, and Tzipora soon cultivated a chef‚Äôs eye for fresh ingredients and learned how to bargain with grocers for the best produce. She would plan her meals carefully and indulged her Colombian childhood, rediscovering the bandeja paisa and flatbreads of her youth.\nShe was relaying her sadness at being unemployed one day when Baron asked her ‚Äúwhy not become a cook?‚Äù Somehow the thought had never occurred to her. She began to walk into restaurants and ask for work ‚Äî but most restaurants in Vekllei are run by families, and have no interest in expanding their kitchen for teenage foreigners. There was a restaurant two stops away on the Lola Main Line she liked especially: The Bull, or ‚ÄúToro‚Äù, was run by a loud Spaniard called Che who‚Äôd opened his kitchen into the dining area, so you could see him cook. He was rude ‚Äî Tzipora‚Äôs native fluency picked up more than your average Vekllei person ‚Äî but more importantly, he was an excellent, classically-trained chef. In any other city in the world, he might have been celebrated, but here he ran his business beneath a print shop in the artist‚Äôs quarter of Lola.\nShe asked him for work in the kitchen ‚Äî any work, and he told her no. She finished her meal and left. The next time, he shouted her out of his restaurant. She continued to look around for work, but a quiet stubbornness deep in her heart had convinced her that el Toro is where she wanted to be. She started waiting until closing, where she would ambush him. Six weeks into her courting, Che told Tzipora that she should be sent to an asylum if she wanted to wash dishes so much ‚Äî but if she would stop bothering him, he would expect her at 2pm the next day.\nIt was hard work and it was unrewarding work. In her first year she was ostensibly a commis chef in a kitchen of six ‚Äî but spent more time with her hands in the sink than preparing food. She would occasionally handle ingredients prep too, and had to reach the markets in the early morning to get the best produce or face having a pan thrown at her in the evening. She worked five nights a week from 2pm till the early hours of the morning. Che ran his kitchen like it was in Barcelona. Sometimes she would step out for a cigarette and fall asleep on the stair in the alley, sweat glistening under the streetlamp, cooled by the ocean stir.\nThree years into her work at el Toro she would replace the outgoing sous-chef, and her talent as a cook blossomed. It was a peculiar sight, to have someone of Tzipora‚Äôs height and appearance shouting at young men, totally secure in her authority. The years of labour had hardened her resolve, and refined her intuition. She wouldn‚Äôt be a chef all her life, but she would always be a wonderful cook. In a country of rich foods and hearty wines, that was a precious commodity. More importantly, her persistence in that kitchen earned her place in the country ‚Äî Vekllei was a land of opportunity, after all. It is one thing to visit paradise, but quite another to be a part of it.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-12-21-sundown/","title":"Full Heart"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This character was illustrated as a gift to Bike.

Vekllei is no such thing. This is obvious in subtle ways, like Newda‚Äôs Dumousiantopet, or ‚Äúbeautiful and seperate,‚Äù which advocates the separation of human and natural design. It is also policy; Vekllei is dependent on its landscape as part of Autosuffisouitopet, or ‚Äúself-sustenance,‚Äù and to this end sinks forests for hydroelectric dams and topples mountains for novel urban projects.\nBut unlike most developed countries, Vekllei policy is still informed by an unwavering fear of the natural world. This is a country where belief in demons and fairies and trolls abound; where rivers carry names and biographies; and where Upen‚Äôs gentle animism resurrects most material into life. Vekllei is also geologically active, home to some of the world‚Äôs largest active volcanoes that grow in the tectonic fissures atop which the country sits. The forests they may sink; but should certain mountains come back to life, entire cities will be consumed in fire and ash.\nThis inspires a fear of nature as old as the history of human settlement in the country. Most Vekllei people worship a pantheon of traditional animist gods alongside abrahamic or local faiths. This is a culture in which all things have value, and so the national superego has declined to position human civilisation as unique and consequently exploitative. To this end, Vekllei‚Äôs segregationist environmental policy is inversely a symptom of this direct connection with nature, and a cultural fear of the unknown.\nToday, this is obvious in the ‚Äúforbidden regions‚Äù of the country. After the war, vast territories of the interior were designated as Kronaismioudelfia, or ‚Äúcrown land‚Äù. These forbid sovereign entry or human exploration in any capacity other than personal curiosity. These are dark pockets of ancient wilderness, where myth and legend abound. If you enter them and become lost, only volunteers will seek you out ‚Äî for the purposes of the Vekllei government, you have exited the sovereignty of the nation-state. They function in part as natural reservations, but that neglects just how isolated, wild and untouchable these regions are.\nAt first glance, this might seem archaic and superstitious, but like most spirituality-as-policy in the country, it serves a foundational component of Vekllei society (and subsequently, the economy). As Vekllei seeks out deindustrialisation via post-scarcity systems, a sincere respect for landscape as living and dangerous becomes essential. Mere appreciation or stewardship in abstract is, by Vekllei metrics, not much different than naked exploitation. Removing human constructions from landscape also necessitates the dismantling of landscape, cartography and tourism conceptually. There are few national parks in the country, but hundreds of Kronaismioudelfia. Deep within them lurk unmapped, undocumented things ‚Äî and at their hearts are pure springs, grasslands of eternal life, spirit dwellings and the souls of your ancestors.\n In this image, Tzipora meets her reflection with the Upotenne sign for peace and friendliness. Reflections of mirror-pools in Vekllei are believed to be places to meet spirits. While your reflection may not be a spirit, your reflection is closer to their world than your own, as a deconstruction of image and physicality. In this sense, Tzipora is hoping her gesture may carry through into the other worlds and convince them of human peacefulness. Such gestures are good manners, considering she is no longer in sovereign human territory and stands in the land of gods.\n ","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-12-05-gods/","title":"Crown Land of No King"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article was featured in Issue #7 of the Atlantic Bulletin  She would spend a long time by the rivulet that ran behind her apartment.

After all, by metrics of representation, the Atlantic nation\u0026rsquo;s electoral system often sputters and fails, undermined by the bundling of the human and natural votes as equal, and the wildly disproportionate borough system. But if democracy is a way of life and not just a ballot in its box, then we can see democracy acted out all around us in Vekllei.\nCities are living things; they are made up of people hurrying and talking and building. In cities, we see Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s centralised society/decentralised life contradiction lean towards \u0026ldquo;deurbanisation\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;local transparency\u0026rdquo;.\nThe four principles of Vekllei life are:\n Self-management and self-interest through Sundress Municipalism. Classification of property as an independent social organ, like nature. Abolishment of currency and currency-substitutes. Economic feminisation.  Ranked in order of their immediacy to the average person, we can see that Sundress Municipalism is at the core of Vekllei life. What exactly is Sundress Municipalism? It describes the organisation of Vekllei cities, which are arranged around the following principles:\n Local employment, or \u0026ldquo;commutelessness.\u0026rdquo; Slumlessness, beautification, and a will to architecture. Property stewardship. Open air and clean water. Land usefulness (\u0026quot;friendliness\u0026quot;). Private ownership of private needs. Public ownership of public needs.  These values are oriented around a deeply Vekllei valuation of space, and the accessibility of place and material to ordinary people. They also reveal some peculiarities in their listing \u0026ndash; what constitutes a private and public need, and what constitutes ownership, are deeply spiritual concepts in Vekllei, and their use here relies on uncoded intuition. Let us not forget we are dealing with a state that considers itself to be the human ambassador of the ground on which it sits, and so \u0026ldquo;public\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;private\u0026rdquo; include the nonhuman in their metrics. This is how, much to the amusement of foreigners, buildings can and often do \u0026ldquo;own themselves\u0026rdquo; in Vekllei. Most ownership is proved by stewardship; the use of space. The person who works the shop and lives above it, owns the shop.\nThis image depicts the Vekllei city of Adouisneh, the florid culture capital of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Northwest. It is one of the \u0026ldquo;Five Crowning Cities\u0026rdquo; of Vekllei, measured by population and cultural significance, and was the site of one of the earliest parliaments in the world, centuries before the monarchy would come to power. You can see here the tension between old-world European planning and new-world Sundress Municipalism in the architecture and layout of this city.\n A cactus bloom is beyond any bloom, I think, manufactured by plants anywhere in the world. And there you have an interesting syllogism, haven‚Äôt you? The desperate nature of the armed plant and the exquisite, beautiful efflorescence it produces. Something to think about. There you see, revealed, some processes of nature, the significance of which I don‚Äôt gather at the moment.\n \u0026ndash; Frank Lloyd Wright, Nov. 1952\nPerhaps urbanised modernity is the cactus, and Sundress Municipalism is the blossom.\nIt is not that Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s feminised Municipalism represents a clean departure from how cities look and feel, but instead constitutes a rethinking of urbanism; it is an ideology of homesteads, decentralisation, clean air, food production, arts and crafts, leisure, and the spirit, if not the literal presence of, \u0026ldquo;disposable income.\u0026rdquo; It is not enough that a factory should be the property of the people who work in it; a factory should become adjacent to the home, a part of it, designed in ways that benefit the good instincts of ordinary people. Vekllei is a celebration of the architect; automatons may now do a lot of the work, but all design is deeply human.\nThis is the heart of the dream. Vekllei is not a big enough country to gift each person an acre of land to do with as they wish; it is, however, sophisticated enough to decentralise that \u0026ldquo;local acre\u0026rdquo; among the community, cultivating those same values in a modern skyline and allowing the city to flow across the landscape, changing as it responds to the place around it. Ownership is important; stewardship is especially important. By allowing people to own and use land, you give them dignity. Above all, design and architecture are important for the same reason spatiality is important \u0026ndash; they give presence to and emulsify work and leisure.\n After the mid-twentieth century, modernism began to encircle the world and the architectural and urban images once projected as utopian began to fill real space. In the 1960s this reached a saturation point; utopia was, ironically, realised.\n \u0026ndash; Karatani Kojin, Architecture as Metaphor, 1983\nThis occurred because, upon realising that art must be removed from architecture in order to safeguard it against a looming \u0026ldquo;loss of subject,\u0026rdquo; avant-garde thinkers methodologically reestablished architecture as \u0026lsquo;construction\u0026rsquo; \u0026ndash; utilitarian efforts towards grand ideas. With art removed, architecture was able to close in on the inherent placelessness of utopia. In Vekllei, this approach is extant (though diminished by their absurd place-metaphysics) through Newda, the indigenous design ideology that continues to service architecture through social, rather than artistic, methods.\nThe \u0026ldquo;big idea\u0026rdquo; Newda is an agent for, wrapped up in Sundress Municipalism, is very straightforward:\n The city should be everywhere and nowhere.\n In Adouisneh, despite its thousand years of history, we can see postwar Newda come to life in its integration and decentralisation of the \u0026ldquo;city\u0026rdquo; as a living process, moving people and their concerns closer together. Developed only with the consent of the architect, Vekllei has become an architocracy, serving decentralised, pleasant living through bureau monopolies.\nPerhaps, after all, it is the necessity of state authority that is the cactus, and the middle-class free lifestyles of Vekllei people that make up the blossom.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-11-28-city/","title":"Out of The Ground and Into The Light"},{"content":"","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/tags/guide/","title":"guide"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article was featured in Issue #7 of the Atlantic Bulletin  For all you\u0026rsquo;ve seen of Vekllei and her characters, you\u0026rsquo;ve never heard a single one of them speak. This post marks a little exploration into the Vekllei language, and a \u0026lsquo;soft launch\u0026rsquo; of my website, https://millmint.net. The proper launch will come at the end of the month.\nThis post will briefly discuss some elements shown in this infographic, but a large article on the language has been drafted here. If you have some interest in constructed language, and some of the more playful aspects of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s evolving utopian communication systems, I encourage you to take a look at it. The website is incomplete, and both the articles on characters and Vekllei itself are very incomplete. Otherwise, a growing archive, essays, and issues of the Atlantic Bulletin are all available. Have a poke around, and let me know if anything breaks! The site has dark mode, if you\u0026rsquo;re a gamer. Just click the moon.\nOne Language, Many Parts To borrow from the article linked above, the Vekllei language has six core systems often referred to as sublanguages. They are as follows:\n Spoken Vekllei, which is everyday spoken language. It draws from two glossaries with different meanings and feelings, called Oa and Loh. Topet, which are logographic characters (occasionally characterised as hieroglyphs). Like other pictographic languages, Topet characters can be broken down into repeating components, called Topotte. Rapotenne, is the traditional logographic language of names. It is much older than Topet, and has more in common with spiritual runes than modern logography. Potenne, lit. ‚ÄúHand-Talk‚Äù, is a sign language that incorporates gestures and signing to add meaning to emotion to spoken language, and occasionally in place of it. Upotenne, lit. ‚ÄúSpirit-Hand-Talk‚Äù, as the recreation of runes in human form, used limitedly in spiritual ritual. Vekllei Semaphore is the codification of colour and shape. Traditionally limited to colour, shape and pattern are now also included in Vekllei Semaphore, in which full sentences can be formed.  In This Picture We can see various parts of the Vekllei sublanguages on display, including Topet, Rapotenne, Potenne and Vekllei Semaphore. Before Cobian gets close enough to say hello, Tzipora has already delivered a devastating compliment via a simple three-finger tap to the palm, admiring how she looks. A couple of descriptions of Tzipora written in Topet have been annotated on her left, to demonstrate its use, including a tongue-twister (\u0026ldquo;She always tucks her shirt\u0026rdquo; becomes \u0026ldquo;Louisn Laismoh Loah Liousmineh\u0026rdquo;). You\u0026rsquo;ll notice Topet looks especially hieroglyphic, even by pictographic standards.\nTzipora\u0026rsquo;s full Blood Name is spelled out in Rapotenne below, which is markedly different from Topet in history, characters and grammar. Most formal names in Vekllei employ a seal in place of writing it out in full ornamentation, which has been provided below along with a formal signature. Her signature is entirely pictographic; elements are arranged according to symbolic value, rather than phonological legibility.\nOn the right, we can see an example of how Semaphore lives up to its name through its presence on flags, reinforcing and communicating information without conventional literacy. Also shown are a handful of basic symbols as they relate to authority, with the landscape of Vekllei superseding all human organs. Their colours matter, and so their meanings are more complex than what is described here \u0026ndash; for example, a small black circle refers to a human being, but an orange one refers to an arctic person (usually Vekllei).\nFinally, we have a breakdown of the word comiya (also looked at here), which means \u0026ldquo;friend.\u0026rdquo; Tzipora and Cobian are comiya, and Moise and Cobian are\u0026hellip; sort of comiya. The introduction here of phonetic complements, which are duplicate consonant-pairs used to slightly alter the semantic meaning of a word without changing its pronunciation, allows the idea of a \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; to be conceptualised in many different ways, to encompass all sorts of relationships. This one here implies a sort of na√Øve love (by using characters for late autumn, young woman and a glacial beach, all pronounced /k/.)\nLimpettes are tails that underline vowel-forms called hieyerette to enhance legibility. Although ornamented Topet has visually distinct consonant-pairings, business Topet does not generally use superscript and so limpettes designate the vowel-form. If you\u0026rsquo;re a bit lost, that\u0026rsquo;s okay. It\u0026rsquo;s in the main article, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to make this post too long.\nYou can imagine then, even with only a handful of examples of language in practice here, how complex Vekllei can become as phonological and semantic meaning compound, combine and seperate in different forms and contexts. The spoken word can be altered by the physical gesture, and the physical gesture can be altered by the written word.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-11-14-language/","title":"How to Speak Vekllei"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article was featured in Issue #7 of the Atlantic Bulletin  When the light shifted just right, the ceramic tiles and concrete footpaths twinkled like water off the back of a swan. 16th Century witches could build a hut in the woods and forage for herbs; 21st Century witches were susceptible to modernist persuasions.\nThe Demotic Meeting Hall was constructed twenty years prior as the main meeting hall of the National Dockworker‚Äôs Union. Situated on the coast, and along the recently-built monorail line to Roya, it dominated the coastline like a mythic lighthouse.

Crazy shadows distorted beneath car headlights. It occurred to her in some way that, as she approached dying, she was living out the ultimate dramatic fantasy of the American misplaced girl, in the same way the townsmen were fulfilling their grotesque constellation of death by murdering women. To them, she was not Zelda, or an agitator, or even a maid from Motel Grande; she was just a girl of girl-form, washed out; beat in; bent before the death-bridge where the creek rolled on below. It was brutal and violent, and also the most tacky thing. It scaled up and down, because it was murdering.\nThe hearts of America are like overused sandpaper ‚Äî all dull. This is how it played out in 2063, ages into the Great American Decline and well before it was put down like a sick dog by Chinese methods. The worn out bodies of the hedonistic coasts were numb to the spectacle of collapse and found themselves displaced and unfeeling, and so the neurotic motions of vampiric culture barons responded. In 2036, long before the Dallas Secession or Zelda‚Äôs birthday, the NBC under the Radio Corporation of America broadcast the first televised execution in the United States of child serial killer Wayne Graham. This enticed similar coverage across all major television networks for subsequent executions, which were viewed by millions of Americans. The format culminated in NBC‚Äôs The American Justice Show programme, in which the method and subject of broadcasted executions were made participatory by public poll. It was tremendously successful but was cancelled in 2041, after the botched death of George Kovacs.\nThis is not necrotic; this is neurotic; it is the ultimate sucking up of human desire into the commodity-form, and it was only the beginning. It is not just a poetic coincidence that the cancellation of American Justice saw the legalisation (or at the very least, decriminalisation) of prostitution in all regions but the Deep South over the next decade (which would contribute to the eventual secession). This is pleasure in its raw form, and the murder of prostituted immigrant-labourers and the eroticisation of the death of Wayne Graham‚Äôs teen-age victims was one and the same. The necroticisation would arrive later, as modernity tumoured and pleasure outpaced the sovereignty of the federal government.\nHere was Zelda, who was a perfect caricature of the real American in the 21st century ‚Äî born overseas, poor as shit, and dressed up for dying. And why shouldn‚Äôt she die? All the old things were dead. God, kings, outrage, empathy, optimism ‚Äî it was all thrown in the creek, with the rest of the immigrant-labourers. Why shouldn‚Äôt a child and her sensitivity be among them? You could change the channel on television and see pornography and the brutal violence of the Secession adjacent to each other. If you clicked the knob back and forth fast enough, they could become one and the same.\nTzipora was the last to arrive and among the first to be lynched, and maybe they would make postcards out of her dead body.

Why are parts of Vekllei epistemology, or the ‚ÄòVekllei way of thinking,‚Äô contradictory? And if these are contradictions, then surely they must fall apart when they‚Äôre examined? How is it possible to hold two contradictory ideas at the same time and apply them? Let‚Äôs look at Product Atheism, Vekllei‚Äôs foundation for necroeconomics.\nAtismoprodarte, lit. ‚Äúproduct atheism,‚Äù is the process by which Vekllei culture breaks down and rebuilds social preconceptions of objects, including products. Vekllei does not really have commodities in the traditional idea of the word, so it is supplemented here by ‚Äòproduct,‚Äô which more closely resembles the Vekllei word for commodity-forms: prodart or prodatte. This concept is a part of Upen, which is found throughout Vekllei culture and its constitution, and coexists agnostically with organised religion.\n‚ÄúProduct Atheism‚Äù is the term for how Vekllei people think about the objects that make up their lives ‚Äî clothes, appliances, toys, trinkets and treasures. These things are not quite commodities, because they are not ‚Äúsold‚Äù. Vekllei does not use money, and so it does not produce items of any economic value.\nAn object‚Äôs economic form, then, is replaced by social form. Among Marxists, they call these social forms fetishistic, because products are given lives of their own and exist independently of the labour that created them. But this doesn‚Äôt work in Vekllei, because\n‚Ä¢ Labour-value is social, not economic. Vekllei people are not paid for work and they do not pay money for products. All work is for social reasons; all consumption is for social needs. Any object that is prohibited from the ordinary Vekllei person is merely landscape; it has no form.\n‚Ä¢ Labour-value is simultaneously suppressed, in imitation of commodity, and celebrated, in imitation of dereification. Vekllei shops look like any foreign shops, because they participate in the same fantasy ritual of shopping and allow easy access to products. At the same time, Upen emphasises the importance of local consumption and objects made by hand, and so Vekllei appliances are generally hand-made. This creates a social bond between the producer and consumer, and breaks down commodity-form, but it can‚Äôt escape the fetishised valuations encouraged by the consumer-fantasy. So it is neither a social or economic product while being both; resulting in a permanent contradiction.\nIn fact, Vekllei ‚ÄòProduct Atheism‚Äô is more or less a rejection of Marxist commodity fetishism, and instead advocates product-worship. This is because objects in Vekllei are regarded as fantasy, and are eroticised by a fantasy market. This is a symptom of the unspoken truth most foreigners are well aware of ‚Äî Vekllei does not have an economy; the Vekllei economy is dead; the economy has been reanimated and is zombified. No money changes hands, no product has value, and all products are abstracted and exclusively physical simultaneously.\nThus Product Atheism has two contradictions; first, that the participatory market economy of Vekllei is both alive and dead, making it both undead and unaliave, and second, that products are both abstracted by Product Atheism and then unabstracted through Product Atheism at the same time, leaving them formless and unconstructed ‚Äî and, per Upen‚Äôs definitions, truly personal and intimate.\nAcknowledging this necroeconomic construction destroys it, and so a final truth is revealed. In Vekllei, the exchange of objects is a social formality, like their uniforms and sign-language, and is both entirely superfluous and essential to the functioning of the state. This is not Marxism; this is not even economic; this is Vekllei, and its cultural forms are what determine all constructions of society. Vekllei‚Äôs ‚Äòmaterial form‚Äô is actually cultural, and Upen is its culture.\nSince Vekllei economic forms are not truly economic, it makes sense that Product Atheism does not merely apply to the economy. All products, or objects, are part of its frameworks. The example used in this picture, depicting women‚Äôs fashion, is a good example of how Upen brings together an abstract object value and a valueless physical object simultaneously. Clothes in Vekllei have a very powerful social function, enhanced by how colour and shape become forms of communication in themselves as part of Vekllei semaphore. Clothes are both figuratively and literally signifiers of personality and individual expression.\nIn Vekllei written script, called Topet, most traditional clothing items are each assigned a single character, giving them a transcendental pictographic quality, a feature impossible to replicate in phonetic speech. In this sense, the written description of a dress in Vekllei supersedes its spoken equivalent, privileging pictorial, transcendental imagery over literalism. This poetic form is part of product-worship, and thus part of Product Atheism. This means that, without even touching the sociological tastes and trends of clothing fashion in Vekllei, we can see Product Atheism smashing Western frameworks against their own assumptions, leaving much of Vekllei epistemology, even today, incomprehensible to ideology without Upen as its framework.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-10-11-metaphysic/","title":"Mittens and Metaphysic"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article was featured in Issue #6 of the Atlantic Bulletin  For a brief period of time, Zelda and Cobian took it upon themselves to make something of their youth. Cobian fancied herself a gymnast, and though this ambition arrived too late and left too soon, she was quite good at it for a while. Tzipora was better suited on the trampoline, where her stiff leg didn‚Äôt give her as much trouble.\nThey trained for about two hours, and after practice they met up to travel home together. Their gymnasium was in a coastal town called Gigayeh, in the borough of Mirah. Here, sloping lava fields were cast in the sea, buried under fine black sand.\nThere was an hour and a half after practice before the evening train arrived to take them back home to Lola, and so they were left with not much to do. Gigayeh had beautiful empty beaches, littered with icebergs that caught the light like jewels, but Tzipora couldn‚Äôt swim and the water was freezing. They could have enjoyed caf√© food in the sun, but Cobian‚Äôs regimented home life had left her incapable of eating outside of her designated meals, and Tzipora could only drink so much coffee. Instead, most of these afternoons, they found themselves sitting on the ocean promenade, watching a handful of locals go about their business as they counted the minutes.\nIn the moment, it was stupefyingly boring. They‚Äôd spent all day at school with each other and usually couldn‚Äôt conjure a word between them. Tzipora would make a remark about a seabird, because she liked them. She had been learning a lot about birds. Sometimes they would share a comic, but they read too fast to fill time. Most of it was spent in the sea air, feeling it grow colder as the day waned, watching the same ocean foam throw itself onto glittering volcanic sand.\n‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs a horned puffin. That‚Äôs special,‚Äù Tzipora said out loud. Cobian didn‚Äôt even look up. Tzipora squinted.\n‚ÄúNo, wait, that‚Äôs just a regular one.‚Äù\nIn time, Tzipora would remember this period of her life fondly, and would visit Gigayeh to recapture that peace. As a teen-ager, however, those afternoons seemed to last forever.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-10-07-boredom/","title":"Atlantic Boredom"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article was featured in Issue #5 of the Atlantic Bulletin  People are not sure what to make of Baron. They are not sure what to make of his daughter, Tzipora, either. To that end, they are lucky to have found each other.\nHis obscurity is part of a severe disposition, made obvious by his astonishing disinterest in friends and hobbies. When he finishes work, he listens to the radio, prepares supper, and goes to bed. His unrelenting seriousness is mitigated by his general passivity ‚Äî Baron is a man totally in control, who keeps to himself and does not take issue with what goes on around him. For his seriousness he is not particularly judgemental or opinionated. To call him boring would be a poor characterisation; he simply feels he has done enough and is not looking to complicate the basic equations of his life.\nTzipora (Zelda to him) complicates this equation. She‚Äôs similar to him in many ways, with her conservative personal disposition and humble lifestyle. She does not make a very good teen-ager.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs funny you say that. I was talking to her the other day, and she was talking about how nice it was to have some peace and quiet,‚Äù Baron once confided in Ayn. ‚ÄúOf course, she looks very young, so sometimes you have to remind yourself that she‚Äôs not a child. She‚Äôs not thirteen, she‚Äôs nineteen, and very unusual, I think. She‚Äôs very smart but she doesn‚Äôt let that on much.‚Äù\nTzipora did not really have ‚Äúphases‚Äù ‚Äî Tzipora was Tzipora, eternal. But she was a much more emotionally attuned person, and her highs were higher and her lowers were lower than anything Baron had felt in decades.\nHe was not always so unfeeling. Baron‚Äôs Ashkenazim parents were pulled straight from the bubbling diaspora of Eastern Europe. They met in the labour zionist movement, but fell out of love with professional organising and immigrated to a struggling Vekllei to work in the national hydroelectricity scheme, among thousands of immigrants employed by the Thunderburo.\nHe was born in 2027 and was not very interested in school as a child. He was rebellious and obstinate, and had only vague ambitions of acquiring a trade certificate in motorcycle repair. His sister, Amelie, died of tuberculosis when he was 11. That was about the end of school ambitions for him.\nHe started conscription early and spent his high school years in an army college. By the time he was 18, he was transferred to military police. It was 2045. He had started dating a middle school sweetheart, Ayn, two weeks before the war in Taiwan broke out.\nYoung Baron died in Taiwan, and another figure in his body returned. He was transferred almost immediately to a junior post at the Americas Bureau at National Intelligence (AB/NI), where he would spend the next decade. While he was stationed abroad, his mother died and his father followed. By this time, Baron was a significant asset for Vekllei‚Äôs deep autonomous intelligence work ‚Äî apolitical, unattached, unsentimental and steady on his feet. He was destined to die in Colombia, employed indefinitely and waiting to be used up. In 2063, he met a fellow Spanish-speaking Jew by name of Tzipora.\nIn many ways, his identity is as fractured as Tzipora‚Äôs, whose Jewish European ancestry was a novel curiosity and not much more. She considered herself a Latina-American until she was Vekllei, and since then she has not been anything more. That was how it went in Vekllei‚Äôs grand secular melting pot. Tzipora was still ta bubeleh to him, but by his mid-thirties Baron had lost most of his mother‚Äôs Yiddish. Tzipora is his closest friend and daughter at the same time. She is a wholly energetic and independent agent in his life, and their relationship alternates awkwardly but intuitively between father-daughter and old friends. Ayn wonders if it is not a coincidence that Tzipora looks like Amelie, his sister.\nThe two of them champion the redemption of losers; the adrift, empty people of the world, acting on a chance to salvage a life and family. Tzipora expected to die in America; Baron expected nothing at all. But when Christmas comes around, and Ayn visits for supper, Taiwan and America melt into air; and their apartment houses the only Jewish Christmas tree in the neighbourhood.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-09-30-father/","title":"Baron, the Father"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article was featured in Issue #5 of the Atlantic Bulletin  It\u0026rsquo;s been a week since I\u0026rsquo;ve posted.

In her last summer, she developed a desperate fascination with her receding childhood, and eventually took her own life outside of the classroom she‚Äôd studied in as a third-grade student.\nHer death deeply disturbed Tzipora, who was keenly aware of how sentimental people died against metrics of their own imagination. She wondered if the government architects who designed schools and universities considered how those spaces gave life to memories.

They are perhaps the most obvious example of the opaque contradictions at the heart of Vekllei life, caught between wholly opposing ideas: between tradition and progress; liberty and control; and, most crucially here ‚Äî between individualism and the burden of society.\nDepicted here are uniforms for education ‚Äî Tzipora as a puffling of the Puffin Scouts on the left, and the others in mere school uniforms. These uniforms are universal and used across all ages of schooling, from kindergarten to university. Even some teachers wear them ‚Äî it starts to stretch the conventional imagination about what constitutes a uniform.\nA few observations on this picture:\nFirst, these uniforms are used interchangeably across ages and disciplines. The difference between a red pleat skirt and a navy skirt is trivial; it is merely a difference in the meaning of the clothing, as part of Vekllei semaphore. They are both equally the school-mandated uniform of education, and can be worn interchangeably from one day to the next, in third grade and at university.\nSecond, there are many small uniquenesses in the uniform of each person, which are accentuated by their surrounding uniformity. Tzipora‚Äôs school shirt is pleated along the buttons, acquired off the rack of a department store. One pair of trousers might be a slightly different shade to the pair next to it. These discrepancies are not regarded as malfunctions of the uniform system, since the system is not designed to make each student conform to a single appearance ‚Äî it is about identity and convenience in a country that spent many decades clawing its way out of abject poverty.\nThese principles apply across many workplaces and in government, too ‚Äî where uniforms are not intended to only signify publicly a place of work but instead form social bonds through clothing, which are intimate factors of ordinary life. In Vekllei, clothes are not an expression of personality, but items to communicate and bond with, regulated not by an authority demanding strict conformity but a desire for identity, physicality, infrastructure and convenience.\nSuch a state of affairs is unimaginable in some countries, especially beyond collectivist or conformist cultures. Individualist intuition suggests that uniforms are actively detrimental to personal expression ‚Äî but this idea demands a scale of expression far beyond the preference for subtlety and delicateness in Upen. Deviations from uniformity, like earrings, the way hair is worn, wristwatches, makeup and minor irregularities accentuate the value of those things, and make them more important. This aesthetic contrast is at the heart of the wider Upen intuition that you can see in architecture and political priority alike. And, as any Vekllei boy will tell you ‚Äî seeing a classroom crush out of uniform for the first time is a religious experience, and only afforded by scarcity.\nVekllei is an individualist society, modelled after self-concern and self-love by a salt-of-the-earth and larrikin people of my native Australia. This is not a people compatible with conventional thinking on the regulation of appearance ‚Äî but, as with many things in Vekllei, both are held true at the same time. They are a free and unrestrained population clothed at work and in school in clothes gifted to them. As an addendum, although many readers find common ancestry with Japan in this project (not unreasonably, either), Vekllei has more in common in some ways with the distant neighbours of my Australian homeland ‚Äî countries that haven‚Äôt been glamorised in the West through culture export. Thailand, Cambodia and Laos are among them ‚Äî coincidentally, all three are rare examples of countries where university students wear uniforms.\nSomeday, we‚Äôll look at the aesthetics of power and authority-worship, inspired at least in part by the history and culture of these countries, and associate them with cultural forces in Vekllei. If you have any questions, just ask.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-09-08-uniforms/","title":"Uniforms in Vekllei"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article was featured in Issue #4 of the Atlantic Bulletin   On the morning of the second day, I watched a fly crawl across the cheek of the middle-aged woman, probably an office worker, lying next to me. It moved up her cheekbone to her temple, stopping now and then to rub its front legs as though performing a ritual. A jagged tear ran down the leg of her dark blue work trousers, but the white calf it revealed was miraculously unscathed. The woman lay still. Probably dead, I assumed. After a while, the fly got on to her eyelid. Suddenly, she reached up and brushed it away, opening the eye. There was still a moist light inside.\n From Insects, by Seirai Y≈´ichi\n By chance, the glass paperweight had survived. When her in-laws‚Äô house had burnt down in Yokohama, the paperweight was among those things that she‚Äôd frantically stuffed into an emergency bag, and now it was her only souvenir of life in her girlhood home.\n  From evening on, in the alley, she could hear the strange cries of the neighbourhood girls. Rumour had it that they could make a thousand yen in a single night. Now and then she would find herself holding the forty-sen paperweight she had bought after ten days of indecision when she was these girls‚Äô age, and as she studied the sweet little dog in relief, she would realise with a shock that there was not a single dog left in the whole burnt-out neighbourhood.\n From The Silver Fifty-Sen Pieces, by Kawabata Yasunari\nOn the 14th of August 2111, the Atomic War began in a Chinese submarine in the South Pacific, and ended six hours later. The war marks the single greatest loss of life in human history and would disrupt human life on Earth in previously unimaginable ways ‚Äî consumer society bottomed out, the world became small, the Earth grew cold, and a new chapter in human history was opened.\nThis political map marks the territories of Earth as they stand five years on, in 2116. There are fewer countries in the world today than in any other point in human history, in part because the catastrophic reduction in human population ‚Äî some 520-600 millions in the first year ‚Äî has emptied out countries and rendered others uninhabitable. Many of these territories here are disputed and, in some cases, autonomous ‚Äî for simplicity, they are presented as they are recognised by the U.N. The map also presents a long-exposure view of the war as it happened, and its remaining fallout currents today. Red dots mark significant nuclear detonations on August 14th. Yellow dots mark surface warfare in some capacity. Red trails mark missile flight, reduced in number here by strict denuclearisation treaties of the decades previous. Yellow trails mark the flight paths of atomic bombers, both supersonic and subsonic. This map does not record failed launches, intercepted missiles or downed aircraft.\nFighting was arranged along political axes ‚Äî namely Western (U.S., U.K., West Germany \u0026amp; N.A.T.O. members), Warsaw Pact (U.S.S.R., Cuba, Egypt), East Asian (China \u0026amp; Korea), and non-aligned (Vekllei, France, Brazil). The war experience was unique to each country ‚Äî Vekllei exchanged warheads and bombs with China but not Warsaw countries, the U.S.S.R. exchanged with both Western and East Asian members, and Brazil fought a catastrophic war against both Soviet and American territories. The immediate aftermath saw a quiet Earth, much of it scorched. Temperatures dropped by 10 degrees centigrade for the first six months, and slowly warmed as debris cleared in the following years. Wide-scale firestorms were tempered by rains that followed the war shortly.\nSome 274 millions of the dead are accounted for in China, where in 2116 the cities still lie in rot, swollen with corpses; heavy with miasma; concrete dams bleached and cracked; the wood all burned up; the rivers warped and quiet; dead fish along them; a surfaced water main weeping blood; harsh asbestine whistling; railcars in a ditch; sloughing skin; tremors; smoke with no fires; confused wandering; bleeding from the inside; families-as-sand; sand-as-trinitite.\nExchanges were confused, helter-skelter, and the combatants rattle off like a death snare. The U.S.S.R., the U.S., France, and Vekllei all exchanged death with China.\nIt would take more than mere annihilation to extinguish the P.R.C., but the toll was nauseating. Beijing and Shanghai were simply disappeared; there was nothing where there once was. The fistfuls of rebar and concrete amidst glassy, ossified landscape were heaped into direct administration of the U.N. The following year, 40-120 million more Chinese would succumb to the greatest famine in the history of the world. Of course, in the U.N., there was good argument for the nuclear retaliation ‚Äî China launched first; why should money and food go to the perpetrator of the vastest disaster in human history? One can‚Äôt help but wonder if the life of an Oriental coolie wells fewer tears than his equivalent in Paris. There are not enough flowers in the world to pay tribute to the dead of China, who were simply dispensed with in European memory and subsumed in part by the United Nations. The communist party would continue to control the vast interior, divided into two states by ethnography, where 1949 seemed closer than ever. Necrotic politics are legitimised in the land of the dead. Soon, we saw the consolidation of nation-states into geographic regions with a disregard for ethnography not seen since the colonial years. This was met with violent resistance in some places ‚Äî in others, locals capitulated to the extraordinary hyperreality of the postwar world.\nThe United Nations was quickly catapulted into the status of a de facto administrative world government in a last-ditch attempt to ‚Äòfreeze time‚Äô as it were, in order to provide the superpowers time to recover from the scope of immediate devastation and prevent humanity from entering a long period of decline. This involved the moving of soldiers on a scale unseen since the World Wars, as U.N. international brigades propped up vulnerable, scorched territories in Central/Western Europe and Asia. The immediate peace of the first days after the war was ruthlessly enforced ‚Äî and strategic opportunism was threatened to meet indiscriminate violence and U.N.-sanctioned nuclear retaliation. There was some belief that the status quo could carry on. So troops of non-combatant countries were supplied, and in some cases press-ganged, into this global mission.\nThe battered United States, acknowledging its ‚Äòcentury of decline‚Äô, found itself consolidating control over its urban, though devastated, coasts. The awkward appellation \u0026ldquo;Dallas America\u0026rdquo; was used as a colloquial shorthand for a disputed territory that insisted on referring to itself as the legitimate United States. The name was only superseded by the ridiculous \u0026ldquo;United Nations Heartlands of the United States,\u0026rdquo; the Aid Region of the U.S. interior that had collapsed in the days after the war. This was buffered by the Mojave and Great Lakes Special Administrative Regions, federal territories that contained war industry and nuclear infrastructure that propped up the precarious coasts. Despite efforts to revive agriculture in the scorched U.N. Heartlands U.S., starvation was met with martial law along the coasts the following year.\nThe U.N. was granted temporary, direct control over several collapsed territories that had either succumbed to nuclear fire or had caved to anarchy in the weeks and months after. In some cases, like the U.N. regions in Hawaii, Jerusalem and the Central Europe International War Government, these behaved as states in themselves, administrated directly by the United Nations Mission for War Recovery. In others, they were merely named as such with the vague promise of future aid. U.N. Cuba and U.N. Taiwan were such examples, in which devastation had been so catastrophic that little remained to govern, and the local population was mostly left to anarchy. In general, there were great inequalities in how the U.N. chose to dedicate resources, largely informed by its largest nation-states and political interests.\nThere are thousands of stories from communities and territories across the world directly impacted by the war ‚Äî from the atomic bombing of Sydney to the catastrophic reactor meltdowns of Brazil‚Äôs south. The war was unprecedented in scale and devastation. This map reveals little of the profoundly human tragedy that was brought about, nor does it invoke the difficult existential artefacts that are still being reckoned with. Perhaps humans are just animals after all ‚Äî destined to die out the way so many have in this age. Most tragic was not the colossal scale of death, or the collapse and pain that followed, but the upending of domestic society into violence, in which people of consumer society ‚Äî the middle class ‚Äî found themselves with not much at all, thrust into a world of chaos and suffering in which all prior epistemologies evaporated. Like the flash of blue light that preceded the roar, it was the stuff in supermarkets and department stores that marked the absolute grotesqueing of life in the new age.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-08-31-grotesque/","title":"Absolute Grotesque"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article was featured in Issue #4 of the Atlantic Bulletin  Hello,\nI‚Äôm Hobart.

Broadly, Newda buildings emphasise distinction from the surrounding landscape (called Dumousiantopet, or ‚Äòbeautiful and seperate‚Äô), natural decay, and honesty in material and construction. Vekllei‚Äôs great Parliament House is Newda; as are the little rural homes found in the mountains inland in Vekllei.\nTzipora‚Äôs house in the village of Montre-Lola (as depicted on the map here) is built in what Vekllei calls ‚ÄúAzores revivalism‚Äù, a Newda style heavily influenced by the stripped deco and streamline moderne buildings of a century prior.

Her home stands amidst the farmland of Montre-Lola, and very near the library and primary school where she works. Her property is marked at its end by a creek that runs into the Dentre River.

There is a contemplative instinct among educated people that ‚Äî if they could simply will themselves into a state of self-actualisation ‚Äî death would only be an obstacle to greatness.\nAs Tzipora found out quickly, the opposite was true ‚Äî death and temporality were wells of meaning against which all great people, beauty, and human constructions were cast.\nTzipora Desmoisnes is what is known as a Gregori Baby, a catch-all term for a unique genetic condition that has seemingly produced a variety of miracle children appropriate for the frothing futurism of the atomic age ‚Äî boys and girls who, suspended in the purity and good-naturedness of childhood ‚Äî live forever.\nThere is no single ‚ÄúGregori Baby‚Äù ‚Äî each is unique, and Tzipora is the 13th to have been recognised overall. The phrase is a shortening of Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome, a stand-in for medical information that isn‚Äôt there. The first, Gregori Hordiyenko, was born in 2024. He was healthy, and died of unrelated causes in his 20s. Tzipora, at 13th, continues to live to this day and is the oldest person on Earth.\nThere is a disturbing trend among the Gregori children, first heralded as miracles and symptoms of the space age, to deteriorate medically as more are born. The culprit is the malfunctioning of telomeres in their DNA ‚Äî the source of their longevity ‚Äî which regularly produce devastating chromosomal disorders, including Trisomy 13 \u0026amp; 18, killing most ‚Äúageless children‚Äù before their third birthday. Those that survive are often victims of a severe anaphylaxis caused by a hyperactive immune system ‚Äî rendering many of them permanently sickly. Others find themselves unageing, but continue to grow ‚Äî reaching as tall as 2.5m before their bodies give out from exhaustion and osteoporosis.\nSo what is Gregori syndrome? What does your average (healthy) Gregori baby look like? Their genetic miracle is linked to the structures of the body that activate at puberty, and so girls vary between 11-16 years of age at onset depending on many factors that affect their development. Boys tend to be a little younger, from 8-14. Between the two, girls tend to be more stable, and all but two of the supercentenarian Gregori children are female.\nAmong girls, they are prepubescent and generally stop ageing on the eve of menarche, or their first period. In Tzipora‚Äôs case, her body is estimated to be 13 years and 11 months old. Unlike many Gregori children, Tzipora lives in a wealthy country and has volunteered for extensive research into her genetic makeup, meaning that much of early medical documentation around Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome was received directly from her case.\nMost obvious is that, at a foundational level, her cells are similar in function to unipotent stem cells, and have been since hormones at the end of thelarche suspended her ageing. This change has occurred somewhere in her DNA ‚Äî exactly where is unknown ‚Äî but the end result is that, unlike regular progenitor cells that make up most adult bodies, the building blocks of her body are capable of cell-renewal. Her telomeres, the endcaps of chromosomal DNA in mammals, are undamaged. And so there is an amazing shift in her basic human structure ‚Äî in which human cell lineage, which usually ends in a mature cell incapable of division, is caught and rearranged. With this considered, it is no wonder that Gregori children suffer from such catastrophic chromosomal instability, and why healthy ageless babies are a rarity. Her body is not exactly a ‚Äúbody of stem cells,‚Äù but for their function in a healthy Gregori child, they might as well be.\nSo it is that nothing about Tzipora is changing. She suffers from pains in her legs often ‚Äî called growing pains, although they are not from growing ‚Äî and her cells continue to replenish, albeit at a rate 1.25 times that of normal people. She is, in essence, ‚Äúgrowing‚Äù as any other premenarchal girl would, but she is not getting bigger or becoming older.\nTzipora is blessed with an adult life in Vekllei, where the ‚ÄúChild‚Äù does not exist as it does in the West, and her individual freedoms are far-ranging. She may smoke, and drink, and has held many different jobs in her life. She holds two doctorates in English and Vekllei Literature. She is obviously sterile ‚Äî even if she were to somehow ‚Äúage out‚Äù of prepubescence into pubescence and receive the required hormones, she simply lacks the genetic code to reproduce ‚Äî but raises many children through her active participation in village life and her roles as Montre-Lola‚Äôs municipal and school librarian.\nIn other countries, with coded roles for children, their problems are much greater. Unable to form adult relationships and often incapable of finding work, many work in entertainment or fall into poverty as they outlive their friends and parents. Socially ostracised and forever young, many are victims of superstition and fear. As the pattern of Gregori children indicates an increase in mortality, even as more are born, their appearance is both a miracle and a tragedy ‚Äî ageing not through mitosis but through weathering the societies in which they live.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-08-12-ageless/","title":"The Thousand-Year-Old Girl"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article was featured in Issue #4 of the Atlantic Bulletin  The Epoch of Rest We‚Äôve spent a lot of time in the 21st century ‚Äî but Tzipora is biologically immortal. Where does she go from here? Well, let‚Äôs enjoy a small glimpse at that future together, by winding the clock forward one thousand years.\nBy 3076, our Solar System is a pleasant place to be. Most of the planets we once gazed at from afar are now habitable and lived on. The Great Epoch of Rest has begun.\nThere is no great interstellar empire, no rise and fall of spacefaring supernations ‚Äî a Vekllei way of life is now lived out in multicultural, prosperous clusters of people across our Solar System. The ordinary person is afforded incredible freedoms previously reserved for science fiction through the accessibility of personal light spacecraft, translated literally as ‚Äúboats‚Äù.\nThis here is the M-7000 APRICOT, manufactured by the Government Aerospace Factories (GAF) of Vekllei. Many companies are contracted by the GAF, including General Reactor S.A., to whom this boat lends most of its flight control systems and all of its power plant. It is a light, personal boat for women built in 2807, making it relatively unique in both its 28th century design language and its gendered marketing. While the personal boat market was growing rapidly by this time, the vast majority of owners and pilots were men. The APRICOT set out to change that, and Tzipora, the world‚Äôs oldest living person with a youthful face, was among the first to demonstrate the accessibility and freedoms of space travel for women and girls in the personal boat market. It was her first boat, and despite its orientation for women it was christened with a male name: BARON.\nIt is a comfortable and pleasant craft that can be lived in for extended periods of time. Tzipora has done just that, travelling to stars in search of water-planets with Micronesian archipelagos, where she likes to spend most of her time. Its glass roof across the entire accessible cabin, including bubbled cockpit, gives it breathtaking visibility in the depths of space and the most scenic of planets alike. Like almost all spacecraft, it is unarmed, save for the pacifying ‚Äújazz‚Äù electric canon, named for its firing sound reminiscent of a double bass strum.\nWhen she tires of being alone, she returns to her hometown of Montre-Lola in Vekllei frequently. Boats are usually parked at off-world stations, preserving the aerospace and quiet of the Solar System.\nLight speed is exceeded through superluminal travel. So-called black boxes require extraordinarily precise programming, since superluminal travel is in all ways but name time travel, and the universe does not tolerate time travel. Coordinates calculated in the universal pyramid system by a pyramid computer ensure that a vessel arrives when it arrives, so to speak. The alternative is going nowhere at all ‚Äî there is no in-between.\nSuperluminal systems are affected by gravity, so any person looking to exceed the speed of light and subsequently visit other stars must take the highways beyond our home system‚Äôs planetary orbit and launch into so-called free-travel from there. There are only a handful of these highways ‚Äî the solar system is very, very large, and human construction is very, very small.\nThere was an instinct among many people that human progress would naturally scale exponentially ‚Äî these were extrapolated from the remarkable progress in the lifetime of Tzipora‚Äôs parents and grandparents, who saw canvas aircraft in their childhood advance to the landing of a man on the moon, and again in her own exaggerated lifetime, in which the provinciality of her youth has simultaneously seen an expansion and exploitation of the planets in our native solar system.\nThis curve of progress was not to be, however ‚Äî and it also explains why we had such trouble meeting aliens in the first place. Part of it was simply that there are very few worlds with water that also formed earthlike landmasses nearby ‚Äî there are many aliens, and Tzipora has seen many herself, but most of them are fish and fish-adjacent. The second is that, if there is civilised life out there, it has most probably encountered the same engineering truths that humanity did, in our great interstellar project of the last thousand years. Namely that, all accounted for, there is no use for wasteful megastructures when a small one will do. People are having less children ‚Äî on Mars, Mercury and Neptune, the population is actually shrinking. What good is the so-called ‚Äúocean liner of the stars,‚Äù with a capacity of millions? There are around 12 billion people across the solar system today. Maybe another 8 billion in the Ala system. Maybe a few millions more who have simply given up society for scattered stars in our neighbourhood.\nIt is likely that if any other civilised races exist, they are simply of our scale, or have destroyed themselves completely in the reckless pursuit of expansion. Humanity is lucky not to count themselves among them.\nThe APRICOT is one of many models produced by Vekllei‚Äôs Government Aerospace Factories. It is now possible for the ordinary person to explore distant stars for themselves, granting freedoms unimaginable in a previous age. Such is life in the Great Epoch of Rest.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-08-09-spaceship/","title":"The 31st Century"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article was featured in Issue #3 of the Atlantic Bulletin  Unique among girls There are a lot of things Tzipora does differently to everybody else, and they start to make a lot more sense when you realise Tzipora either does not realise she is unusual, or does not care.\nShe has a lot of endearing characteristics that give great character to her mannerisms and physicality. She has a small overbite that makes her look a little froggy, and ritually pulls on her shirt and wipes her nose in anxious conversation. She is round-headed and cuts her hair herself. She talks in a low, expressive voice. She has been poorly socialised in childhood, and is afraid of casual conversation with people she does not know. She is keenly socially attuned and feels awkwardness painfully.\nShe wears the same clothes two or three days in a row. The outfits themselves are variations of the same thing, and her tastes don‚Äôt change. Everything hangs off her ‚Äî she likes baggy, airy clothing, and upsizes to accomodate. She doesn‚Äôt like fashionable or voguish people, whom she regards as decadent and offensive. To Tzipora, taste is timeless and bound to the soul. In her case, this fact has held true ‚Äî she has dressed the same as childhood, and very little else has changed about her in that time.\nShe is paranoid and conservative, good-natured and austere, with a moral outlook bound by her deepest anxieties and obsessions. She is deeply spiritual and material, fascinated with objects and their history. She has many collections of many things she‚Äôs found. She‚Äôll likely die a Catholic, but has a confrontational relationship with God and no longer attends mass, as a declaration of humanism.

No food was ever left on her plate. There was a deep anxiety that whatever wasn‚Äôt claimed would be lost.\nShe was also naturally obsessive and material-oriented, keenly aware of the importance of objects measured by metrics in her own silly head. You can discover a lot about a person from their trinkets and toys ‚Äî let‚Äôs discover a bit about Tzipora.\n Her handbag is manufactured by Spaa S.p.A., a design firm in the capital. They‚Äôre a luxury item in the international market but readily available in Vekllei, since few other handbag makers operate on the scale of Spaa. Ayn picked it out shortly after Tzipora‚Äôs arrival for its colour, after Tzipora told her she did not own any red things. Tzipora has a sweet tooth. Especially for soda, which she calls ‚Äúfizzy drink‚Äù. On her person at any time, she carries a flavoured beverage from one of several brands capable of meeting her discerning tastes. She supplements them with a water bottle, since not even fizzy drink refreshes as well as water after phys-ed or a hot day. She also stocks her arsenal of snacks with good fruit picked off trees that overhang footpaths, as well as devastating salvos of Vekllei‚Äôs finest confectionary, including Fruit Tingles and chocolate pearls. Other girls in her class bemoan her childish metabolism as she drinks soda for lunch while they watch the scales. The nostalgic whimsy of the sweets is tempered by two or three loose cigarettes that float around in her purse at any given time. She‚Äôs not a regular smoker, but she‚Äôs prone to attacks related to stress, and nothing helps as much as a drag. She carries matches, for not much reason other than that‚Äôs what Baron uses, and Tzipora is notoriously sentimental. Tzipora has a rock collection that sits on her bedroom sill, and her recent additions sit at the bottom of her purse. She‚Äôs not a rock elitist; quartz from footpaths catches her attention as easily as igneous treasures like palagonite. Her favourite is obsidian. She carries a small collection of useful books, including a contemporary paperback and a notebook. The paperback is for recess and lunch; the notebook is for language notes and phone numbers. Her Vekllei I.D. papers, which are both a passport and a reference booklet of key information and services, are carried on her at all times. It‚Äôs not really necessary in day-to-day life ‚Äî but who knows when it might be, and Tzipora won‚Äôt be the one patting her pockets at the airport gate. Finally, there are a few accessories sitting in the bag. Tzipora made a ring for Cobian in metalworking class, but Cobian is on a school trip to France at the moment and Tzipora is waiting for her return. She has a wristwatch given to her by Baron, which she wears sometimes depending on the occasion. Other items are more precautionary ‚Äî a scarf for the wind, a handkerchief for sneezing, and a spare pair of socks for when she visits Cobian‚Äôs house or if she needs to double up in cold weather. As summer turns to autumn, she also carries gloves and a beanie.  With everything in its place, her handbag is her anchor in the world outside her small second-floor apartment. The decommodification of society has only intensified the social value of objects, and they remain as important as ever in the life of the ordinary Vekllei person.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-07-20-edc/","title":"Tzipora‚Äôs ‚ÄòEvery Day Carry‚Äô"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article was featured in Issue #3 of the Atlantic Bulletin  Vekllei‚Äôs advocation of austerity, apathy, and playfulness as economic principles This post is about the economy of Vekllei. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a long one. If you have any questions, just ask.\nOverview of the Bureau System There are many thousands of companies busy with work in Vekllei. The vast majority of these companies are single-person shops (S.p.A., or senrouiva pettetie anaproiouya). Also common are wobbly shops, or co-operative businesses (S.q.A., or senrouiva qualitie anaproiouya). The largest of the non-bureau companies are village factories (S.p.M., or senrouiva persimonaya manufacturie).\nThe bureau-level world is full of company mastheads that emphasise modernity, dynamism and progress. Vekllei‚Äôs ‚Äúprivate businesses‚Äù, however, tend to be local in taste. The vast majority of S.p.A. and S.q.A. businesses bear the family names of their founders ‚Äî Desmesyo S.p.A., Risyiouisnesn Home Machines S.q.A., etc. Their legal denominations are almost always affixed to the end of their nameplates.\nTheir senrouiva designation marks them as non-bureau businesses. A bureau, as a reminder, is simply the top-level organisation of a trade union that organises business in the country. In practice, it means that a company is responsible to the political organs of the country. Although independent from the government, bureau business is inextricably entwined in government concern and runs parallel to it.\nSenrouvia businesses are also part of the bureau structure, but are in practice not managed directly by them. They are usually united in local concern by so-called petty bureaus; small cooperative organs that safeguard local interest and business. These petty bureaus are often at odds with the bureau organs proper, and so even though they are part of the same structure, they are fundamentally political opposed.\nSo what is sort of business goes on in a bureau proper?\nThere are two common categories of so-called ‚Äúbureau firms‚Äù. You have state industries (S.A., or societie indastrie), which deal with manufacturing and exploitation of resources that require direct management by a public organ. You‚Äôll already be familiar with several ‚Äî General Reactor S.A., Comen Aeroyards S.A., Farmer‚Äôs Syndicate S.A. to name a few.\nYou also have state requisites (A.r., or requoisesiasn amourisocietie), which refer to the vast government-operated organs made up six categories primarily.\n Utilities (A.r.Un.) Transport (A.r.R.) Education (A.r.E.) Local healthcare (A.r.F.) Construction (A.r.Lo.) Automation (A.r.M.)  Yes ‚Äî education is not organised as a government department, but a bureau business. Other state responsibilities are folded directly into government departments ‚Äî war, intelligence, healthcare, police, fire, and the mint are all managed directly by the government.\nArgument With the legal division of enterprise laid out, let us examine again the four precepts of the Vekllei economic ideology.\n Self-management and self-interest through Sundress Municipalism. Classification of property as an independent social organ, like nature. Abolishment of currency and currency-substitutes. Participatory employment. Economic feminisation.  These four principles reveal a great deal about the character of the country, and stand largely at face value. There is an interest in chasing the promises of modernity while deconstructing its metaphysical constructions, through the abolishment of exchange-value, property and the overhaul of gender-economics. There are anarchist gestures in each principle, yet it is obvious that the product of these values complexify the conventional anarchist imagination. This is part of a series of contradictions ‚Äî between free and planned markets, between internationalism and provinciality, between man and woman, between freedom and security.\nAusterity The bureau system is plagued by inefficiencies, arising from logistic systems premised on warehousing, poor Coasean bargaining between petty bureaus and proper bureaus, a political emphasis on macroeconomic outcomes, a decoupling of aggregate demand and national economic output, cultural intolerance for Pareto inefficiencies, etc.\nLuxury goods often vary in both supply and access, and economies are often severely localised to the point of provincialism, meaning that Vekllei has failed to transition reliably to a modern consumer society. The inhabitants of the Montre borough most often eat seafood because speciality meats, especially authentic red meat, are scarce. The opposite is true in Yana. Clothes are repaired and regifted, appliances are available only from regional outlets usually located in the same city as the factory, and culture and diet are fiercely regional.\nThis is, in part, a result of unflinching national austerity and the sublimation of artificial markets prompted by Vekllei‚Äôs gold-based auxiliary currency, which necessitates meeting debt obligations for its strength internationally. There is a belief in Vekllei that the wealth of the country allowed the abolition of the currency ‚Äî in fact, the opposite is true. The abolition of currency allows a permanent wealth that compensates for the inefficiencies of the bureau system. The bureau firms do not pay their workers ‚Äî on paper, there are no expenses for anything beyond raw commodity exchange. This is how Vekllei‚Äôs largest companies ‚Äî and, per the bureau system, its government ‚Äî remain solvent.\nAusterity is a cultural force, too ‚Äî the scarcity of luxury goods inflates their social value, where comforts and necessities are largely abundant in automation. It creates an unimportant hardship that keeps Vekllei people forward-facing, lean, and ambitious. To acquire Picco S.p.A.‚Äôs iconic lounge chairs, you have to travel to their outlet in Horn, hundreds of kilometres from the capital area. There is no motivation for a craftsman to meet demand ‚Äî there is no petty consumption, either. To own a Picco chair means you have understood its cultural value, utility and craftsmanship, and have made the effort to find and transport one to your home. Inconvenience, and by extension, austerity, is celebrated as a ‚Äútrial of ownership.‚Äù Objects are very important in Vekllei, and craftsmanship is highly valued, and so people like to surround themselves with hand-made, sublime things wrought not just by the labour of the artisan, but their own effort to acquire it.\nPetty austerity instills a national sentiment that tells the ordinary Vekllei person they are hardier than the ordinary American or European, even if the wealth of the ordinary Vekllei person is much greater than that of the ordinary American or European.\nApathy Despite a vast, loosely organised private market in the senrouiva categorisation, Vekllei does not reward entrepreneurial ambition. Ambitious people are funnelled into positions of power in bureau firms and political office, but the founding of S.p.As and S.q.As is rarely motivated by a desire for influence or power. Indeed, artisanal S.p.As are often incapable of the sort of economies of scale needed for expansion. Vekllei instead relies on a sort of economic apathy, in which aggregate demand and productivity are spurned for immediate interest and pleasure.\nThis ensures that\n luxury products remain creative, personal works per Upen‚Äôs insistence on the symbiosis of labour and product the private senrouiva market is not capable of threatening the provincialism of Sundress Municipalism, which might make a commodity universally accessible and threaten to introduce generic consumer society into Vekllei life the private senrouiva market under petty bureau organisation does not threaten the organised de facto monopolies of the bureau companies  If Vekllei has replaced the commodity with the object, then it is through economic apathy that they have ensured objects will never again become commodities. Just as the ordinary Vekllei person is apolitical, so too are they apathetic towards change in their purchasing habits, favouring small, inconvenient and personal brands over those exploiting aggregate demand. In a sense, this also contributed to the popular Vekllei term product atheism, in which the metaphysics of products are dismantled and rearranged into social forms.\nIn this sense, the apathy is found on both ends ‚Äî within the senrouiva business owner, who is provided little upward mobility to satisfy ambition beyond local and regional expansion, and within the consumer, who recognises products only within cultural and social dimensions. Neither is conducive to a functioning, fair market on an interregional scale.\nPlay Play is the foundational motivation of most work in Vekllei. There are existential motivators, too ‚Äî a desire to wield power, or professional legacy ‚Äî but in many professions it is play by which a Vekllei person justifies labour. It is also why work is fiercely protected by petty bureaus and other labour organisations ‚Äî work is their connection to wider society, and that connection is held sacred in Upen.\nIt is through work as play that Vekllei is able to justify the employment of children. Financial motivations for work have all but disappeared ‚Äî in its place, the workplace has to convince people to work. There are few state protections for businesses unable to maintain a workforce, either ‚Äî it is one of the most common reasons for the shuttering of a company. The boss must convince his workers to stay, and so a total inversion of power has occurred.\nIn place of money, there is prestige, and in prestige there is myth. Few people have genuine interest in Fordism. Many more are attracted to the hand-crafted furniture of Picco S.p.A., and becoming recognised as a builder of great things. In a sense, a person ‚Äúacts out‚Äù the role of a craftsman, in the same way a person ‚Äúacts out‚Äù the role of a police officer, or ‚Äúacts out‚Äù life as a pilot.\nIn this system, the childish spirit of recreation, duty and ‚Äúthe adult world‚Äù is acted out by millions of Vekllei people each day. Seeds planted by a child play-acting as a farmer continue to grow, and so too does the Vekllei economy feed its population through the intersection of fantasy and labour. At this point it is obvious that play is not fantasy at all, but in fact a motivation for labour as genuine as profit. Where it falls short, in hard, disempowering jobs, it is automated and conscripted through the mandatory service system. As it is often described:\n‚ÄúThe Bureau System is labour-intensive where wanted, alleviated by industrial machinery where preferred, and automated where necessary.‚Äù\nIn its wake are states of play, and through play comes a decent framework for living, obvious in the basic satisfaction of the Vekllei people.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-07-13-economy/","title":"The Race for Inefficiency"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article was featured in Issue #3 of the Atlantic Bulletin  There are two regular police organs in Vekllei.\n Fedecenoayan porits (national police, or venopor) Comoisniyan denporitsa (local police, or cosmopor)  A young venopor officer stands on the left, in the full street regalia they‚Äôre renowned for. Unlike cosmopor, they often carry machine guns while on patrol and are stationed outside of government buildings, hospitals, train stations, ports, schools and any company managed directly by a bureau, which is a trade organ of national importance. They are special units of special purpose, and supplement the deficiencies of local policing through their training and tactical deployment.\nThey are police insofar as they protect and respond to their community, including through special tactics situations, but are paramilitary in their wider function as a defence force for critical infrastructure. This is reflected in their history, traced cleanly back past independence and the Atomic War to the royal guards and junta federal police of old society, which continue to be reflected in their uniforms and several other ceremonial artefacts, like swords and knee boots. Venopor is a complex organisation with many different purposes. There are street patrols, pictured here, but there are also intelligence units associated with HO/NI and by extension the military, as well as tactical response teams, bomb squads, search and rescue and most other specialised emergency units outside of the capabilities of any given local police station.\nThis is contrast to the cosmopor, a more conventional police outfit. A cosmopor officer stands on the right, in standard summer uniform. He carries a radio, revolver and rubber baton for the worst of his duties, and is embedded deep into his local community. Cosmopor officers traditionally visit and introduce themselves to each house in their beat, and spend far more of their time mediating, counselling and organising than they do making arrests. The autonomy of most Vekllei communities largely spurns petty legal proceedings, and so the cosmopor are a critical aspect of sundress municipalism, resolving disputes personally and taking custody of a person only when it‚Äôs needed. Most crime in Vekllei tends to be emotionally motivated ‚Äî so it is in this domain that cosmopor navigate.\nThis makes the cosmopor especially powerful figures in a Vekllei village or township, but their duties are closely watched. While the Vekllei village may be autonomous, all officers in Vekllei are responsible to a division of venopor called ‚Äúofficer welfare,‚Äù or picosec, which operates autonomously to seek out incompetent or misbehaving police officers, no matter their jurisdiction or status. Where most business in Vekllei has very little in the way of professional behaviour or ‚Äúwork culture‚Äù, policing in Vekllei is held to high standards, and they are severely bound by traditions that have become codified as the country has grown. This is a time and place where the children of police often inherit the jobs of their parents, and the constables of a village often have roots that go back centuries. This often makes cosmopor very respected figures, and their successors and recruits are expected to work for that respect.\nIn a country that has done away with money as a measure of success, professional legacy is profoundly important in Vekllei. In this inversion of priority, teachers, doctors, pilots, constables and librarians are celebrated. This is not founded in a general egalitarianism, but in fact the precise opposite ‚Äî a celebration of success and influence, touching the lives of those around them. The glamour, and paycheque, has largely been stripped away. Only the work remains, and so that work has become more important than ever.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-07-08-police/","title":"Police in Vekllei"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article was featured in Issue #2 of the Atlantic Bulletin  What is Vekllei?\nHi, I‚Äôm Hobart and I write and draw Vekllei at Studio MillMint.\nThis is a pretty complex project. Not just complex insofar as there‚Äôs a lot to read about it, but that it uses concepts and terminology you might not be familiar with if this is your first time around utopian fiction.\nSo Vekllei is a utopia ‚Äî what does this mean? It‚Äôs latin for ‚Äúno place,‚Äù and I use that literally. Vekllei, in a literal sense, cannot exist. Not because I think it could never have existed, or that some part of it is completely unreasonable, or it breaks the laws of physics ‚Äî but because it exists in a certain place and time that is just isn‚Äôt replicable. It‚Äôs all built from the ground up.\nVekllei is a very good place to live, but it is not perfect. Utopia does not mean ‚Äúperfect place‚Äù. Utopia is a form of social dreaming, much like worldbuilding, linked to the values and priorities of its author. In utopian studies, ‚Äúutopia‚Äù is usually broken down further:\n Eutopia ‚Äî ‚Äúgood place‚Äù Dystopia ‚Äî ‚Äúbad place‚Äù  Note that both form a part of the ‚Äúutopia‚Äù ‚Äî this is appropriate, since Vekllei is grounded in a social realism that acknowledges the good and bad parts of life. Indeed, they are inseparable ‚Äî you cannot have the light without the dark. Obviously, in my eyes, Vekllei is very much a eutopia. You can read more about Vekllei (the country) by clicking here.\nThere are three parts to my ‚Äúsocial dreaming‚Äù:\n Landscape ‚Äî the world and country of Vekllei. When you think of ‚Äúutopia,‚Äù this is it ‚Äî shining modernist cities against striking landscapes. Character ‚Äî not all social dreaming takes place in spaces. Some of it is built around experiences, objects and relationships. Tzipora is a ‚Äúcharacter utopia‚Äù in the sense that she represents a utopian life experience, full of stories good and bad. Author ‚Äî Vekllei is a representation of the problems of my life, as a form of escapism. A lot of my posts here reflect dissatisfactions and displacements in my own life ‚Äî consumer society, commodification of childhood, wage labour, postmodernism, etc. I‚Äôm very much a part of this utopian dialectic.  Let‚Äôs run through some of the common queries and misunderstandings about Vekllei\nWho are you? A Tasmanian illustrator.\nYou‚Äôre not Japanese? „ÅäÂâç„ÅØ„ÇÇ„ÅÜÊ≠ª„Çì„Åß„ÅÑ„Çã\nWhy is Vekllei a utopia? It makes me feel better about my life and the world. It‚Äôs escapism; it‚Äôs a dream.\nIt‚Äôs a bit cringe to grandstand your political beliefs, doncha think? Vekllei is a personal utopia. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm selling. At least you‚Äôre getting good opinions.\nWhere‚Äôs the tension if it‚Äôs perfect? Vekllei is very cynical and tragic in places. Utopia is just a reflection of the author, good and bad.\nIs there a novel? A story? A comic? I‚Äôm working on a comic right now. I‚Äôm pretty much working on Vekllei full-time so I‚Äôm hoping to announce it soon. I‚Äôve got a lot of different Vekllei projects going.\nWhere is Vekllei? Iceland.\nWhy does Vekllei look Japanese? Vekllei is like a country of Scandinavians speaking French with an Aussie accent in Sh≈çwa era Japan/Maoist China/Taiwan etc. Vekllei looks however I imagine utopia looks.\nHow does that make sense? Why can‚Äôt it just be cool?\nIs your alt-history thought out? Vekllei‚Äôs history is whatever I need it to be. I‚Äôm always trying to be realistic, but it‚Äôs all worked backwards from the setting. I‚Äôm not really ‚Äúworldbuilding‚Äù in a typical sense. Very little of it is published, most of it is retrieved on request. Just ask if you have questions.\nIs Vekllei communist? No.\nBut Vekllei calls itself ‚Äúpetticoat socialist‚Äù. Vekllei is set in a culture of Marxist revivalism in the 50s and 60s. A lot of Vekllei‚Äôs lexicon is set in that context. Vekllei is a decentralised democracy that doesn‚Äôt use money. It‚Äôs a sort of participatory economy.\nWhy the \u0026ldquo;petticoat\u0026rdquo;? Vekllei is a female country. Womanhood is decommodified. It\u0026rsquo;s maternal, social and friendly where socialist rhetoric is masculine, technocratic and progressive.\nWho is Zelda? Zelda is another name for Tzipora. She has two names specifically to confuse you.\nWhat is the ‚Äúbulletin‚Äù? I publish the Atlantic Bulletin once a month via email. It‚Äôs got the month‚Äôs posts in it as well as facts and tidbits from Vekllei. DM me an email if you want to join.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-06-30-project/","title":"What is This Project?"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article was featured in Issue #2 of the Atlantic Bulletin  Map Key\n Red: Magjet trains, 750km/h\nYellow: Bullet trains, 300-400km/h\nOrange: Regional trains, \u0026lt;150km/h\nBrown: Local trains, including limited express, \u0026lt;100km/h\nBlue: National highway\nDashed: Ferry line\nGreen: tarmacadamed airport\n The largest division of any portion of Vekllei land is the borough; a region of varying size and population with common culture, food dependency and economic interest. Anything larger than that is simply Vekllei ‚Äî they are ‚Äúone city‚Äù, after all, and consider themselves a city-state.\nThere have been exactly 100 boroughs since 2015. Each is named after the largest city in its region.\n The smallest borough is Bakur, in Afouismeh, with a population of 7,500 people. The largest is Vekllei proper, in the Capital Region, of 2.4 millions.  This transit map illustrates all 100 boroughs, Vekllei‚Äôs five tallest mountains, its permafrost glaciers and Tzipora‚Äôs home in Montre-Lola. Her five largest boroughs ‚Äî namely Vekllei, Lonne, Adouisneh, Montre and Copette, are highlighted.\nEven in this simple transit map we can see several truths about the country, like its population bias on the West Coast and the emptiness of the Lava volcanic region. You might recognise a few names there, like Lola in the West (Tzipora‚Äôs home with Baron) and Yana in Vekllei‚Äôs Ro Highlands (Ayn‚Äôs birthplace).\nTrains are clean, reliable, fast, efficient and safe. They are incorporated under Vekllei Rail, owned by the Transport Group Bureau. Using this map, designed for domestic tourists and foreigners, the adequacy of Vekllei‚Äôs rail transport is easy to plan around ‚Äî you can eat breakfast in a cafe in the seaside town of Mumen, and hike before midday on the glacial slopes of Askayoisn. Since there are no tickets or costs, there are no excuses for not visiting relatives in the country, now that transport is now a trivial inconvenience.\nEach borough is represented in Vekllei‚Äôs parliament by an elected representative. These representatives wield extraordinarily disproportionate power ‚Äî the representative for Callaisn, for example, represents hundreds of times more people than the representative for Tanger, but both have the same vote. This is because boroughs are not just representative of their populations, but also their environments, industry and other social organs otherwise unable to vote. It is important to keep in mind that Upen (and consequently, policy) recognises the landscape itself as the sovereign organ of the country, and so in this sense it has its own interests and projections.\nIn practice, representatives act in an advisory, nonpartisan role in government, voting rarely in an auxiliary role to the professionalised, elected legislature. Vekllei has a strictly constitutional parliament, and the economy largely prohibits interference. In this sense, the parliament is both partially undemocratic in its inefficiency and apolitical in its orientation as a sort of civil service bureau, managing state affairs and reacting to pressures and the long-term aims outlined in the 2015 constitution. In the Vekllei mindset, the ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù is more or less another bureau, no different or particularly more interesting than the Transport Group Bureau. The trains, at least, have a tangible impact on their daily lives.\nHow appropriate, then, that this transit map produced in the summer months of 2076 combines both monuments of society. It also offers a glimpse of a larger, documented country not necessarily revealed in piecemeal story posts.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-06-14-map/","title":"A Map of Vekllei"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article was featured in Issue #2 of the Atlantic Bulletin  Vekllei, legendarily, does not use circulate currency. Goods and services are moved and offered arbitrarily, provided amply in abundance. Anything that is not abundant is manufactured and distributed directly under the control of a bureau, which is a trade organ responsible to the affairs of the country. At no point do coins or paper currency change hands in the day-to-day affairs of the country.\nIn this sense, Vekllei is usually described as ‚Äúmoneyless‚Äù ‚Äî yet it does in fact have a currency. The Vekllei Kroner, or ‚ÄúCrown,‚Äù is hundreds of years old, and Vekllei still operates a mint for currency. At any time, a Vekllei person can write to the National Mint and order a set of coins, like the ones pictured above. So what is going on here?\nAlthough the Kroner has not been used since 2022, after the last village in Stochi returned coinage to the Mint, it continues to exist to this day as a gold-backed currency in the International Market, through which Vekllei trades with other countries. The physical coins, produced mostly as a novelty in the tradition of mayaesdiou (medallions, or small metal pieces commonly collected and given in Vekllei), are a physical coinage of the International Market. The coins also operate as a form of bullion, or wealth reserve, since each coin is worth exactly its face value in gold. Since the International Market is completely closed and independent of the domestic economy, its value is controlled directly by the so-called Government Bank. It is one of the few gold-backed currencies in a developed nation today.\nTo further complicate things, there are actually two different Kroner in Vekllei. There is the Vekllei Kroner, which represents the International Market, but there is also a seperate Government/State Kroner, which is not minted and used only as an investment mechanism, backed by government \u0026ldquo;white bonds\u0026rdquo; which are usually measures of labour-hours or refined materials. It is, in a sense, a fiat currency alongside a gold-backed currency.\nThey exist independently because they are used for two seperate purposes. The Vekllei Kroner is used a wealth reserve and bullion, and also represents the collective wealth of the Vekllei people. Each citizen, in theory, is entitled to an equal share of the Government Bank, although it can only be withdrawn as currency in specific circumstances. Vekllei also holds substantial amounts of foreign currency in the Government Bank and Vekllei Kroner, which is used to invest and stabilise holdings and capital in foreign countries. The Government Kroner, on the other hand, is used as an investment mechanism abroad, usually in support of infrastructure. It is also used to acquire foreign currencies through investment in foreign capital.\nDespite having two currencies, neither the \u0026ldquo;Vekllei Crown\u0026rdquo; or the \u0026ldquo;Government Crown\u0026rdquo; are used in the domestic economy in Vekllei, which is autonomous and not subject to a central bank. So it is that Vekllei‚Äôs currency is both little more than a novelty and essential to the function of the country in a world still ruled by money.\n In the coinage depicted above ‚Äî 8 coins are minted in Vekllei today. They were designed in 2015, in the year of independence. They represent eight core values in the country.\nThe ‚Äúsmall crowns,‚Äù worth 1VK and 10VK respectively, represent fraternity and liberty, two founding elements of the Vekllei constitution. The 50VK coin is plated in silver and has a small ruby inset. Rubies are used to represent energy, in this case, the vitality of the spirits, which dominate Upen and the Vekllei landscape. The 100, 200, 500 and 1,000VK coins represent different landscapes of the country. As a volcanic island nation, the ocean (100) and landscape (200) coins are fairly straightforward. The humanity coin (500) represents the Vekllei people and ancestry ‚Äî note how humans are placed alongside other natural forces. The flower coin (1,000VK) represents the flowers of the country, which are important spiritually and have formed part of the Vekllei identity. Vekllei has the most flowers per capita in the world. The final, larger 10,000VK coin represents the previous seven together, as a total sum of Vekllei landscape and identity.\n To answer Tzipora‚Äôs question ‚Äî a bottle of fizzy drink cost about 2VK in the waning days of coinage in the early 2020s.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-06-24-crown/","title":"The Vekllei Crown"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article was featured in Issue #2 of the Atlantic Bulletin  The village of Montre-Lola is home to about 400 people in its entirety, a stone‚Äôs throw from the Aisyo borough. Each morning, however, the population swells as 300 children from tiny villages in both Aisyo and Montre take a fast tram to the Montre-Lola Area School No. 2, a district school raising all ages of local youth.\nLike many Vekllei villages, Montre-Lola‚Äôs history is complex and has origin stories in both viking-inuit settlement as well as less sentimental government programmes that flourished after the atomic war. By historical accounts, Montre-Lola has been inhabited since at least 1500CE. By contemporaneous records, however, it was established as a village in land reform during the 1960s and revitalised by the building of the area school in 2057.\nMontre-Lola features many civic objects common to Vekllei villages ‚Äî a nondenominational place of worship (in this case, a historical Catholic church), a constabulary, a doctor, an auto/tractor pool, a general store, a station platform, and a village hall. A map of the village centre is dominated by the Area School, built in an Edunewda style, which features many new facilities that distinguish it from smaller, 20th-century schools. It‚Äôs a good place to grow up; where farmland and earnest modernity collide.\n Montre-Lola is most relevant as the residence of Tzipora Desmoisnes, the world‚Äôs oldest person and one of the first people to be diagnosed with Gregori-Heitzfeld Syndrome. She works as a librarian in both the Montre-Lola Area School and the Montre-Lola Library \u0026amp; Archives, spending most of her 12-hour workday in either of these institutions. She commutes via fast trams, which arrive automatically at the two platforms in Montre-Lola every half-hour and continue out into the surrounding farms. This means that, if she sets her watch right, she can step outside her front door and arrive at the school library in under ten minutes. This journey is marked in red on the map above.\n Dominated by farmland, Montre-Lola is communal and more traditionally ‚Äòanarchist‚Äô in flavour than Vekllei‚Äôs urban boroughs, which are obscured by convenience. As charming as it is suffocating, the community is very close-knit and made up of all sorts ‚Äî smart educated young men and women sent from Montre to teach, as well as farming families that have resided here for centuries. Life moves slower and people know each other. When the school hosts its cross-country race each year, nearly every person in the village is out to watch it.

As an island nation with a large and multifaceted naval armada, the Oa-Class Battlecruiser is the heart of her armed forces, as the flagship of her fleets.\nWhere U.S. doctrine places carriers offensively in the structure of its ship-groups, the Vekllei Navy is considerably more Soviet in its employ of carriers as primarily defensive air-bases to exercise sovereignty over her far-flung territories and island possessions. Oa-class Battlecruisers are notable as hybrid carrier-battleships, and feature a diagonal jetway with capacity for carrier-type naval jets (almost indistinguishable in the illustration above) and a variety of VTOL aircraft, which are common by the 2050s.\nFirst built in the 2050s by the sprawling National Naval Arsenal (located on Vekllei‚Äôs Far East coast, close to the foundries that pour her iron), 12 Oa-Class Battlecruisers are in service in the 2070s. They carry heavy fission reactors built by bureau monopoly General Reactor, supplemented by a gas-turbine generator, as is standard on all Vekllei-built nuclear vessels. Her unusual serpentine funnel is characteristic of Vekllei‚Äôs navy, and is a distinguishing feature of their naval design language.\nHer hulking superstructure and massive 15-inch fore guns recall the capital battleships of yesteryear, but she is a thoroughly modern battlecruiser with contemporary armament and electrics for combat and fleet administration. Named after Vekllei‚Äôs National flower, these Battlecruisers are the third-largest vessels in the navy and are multifunctional by design, often operated as strategic and operational platforms to support Vekllei‚Äôs large defensive armadas that patrol the North Atlantic.\n She is armed with two triple-barrelled 15-inch shore guns that can be loaded with a variety of shells including nuclear payloads, silos for guided missiles, and specialised guns and missile platforms for anti-ship, submarine and satellite warfare. Her powerful communications array and sensors are positioned 80 meters above the surface for the benefit of radar and subsurface monitoring. She can also support up to 12 standard carrier jets at one time, or 16 individual helijets/VTOL craft.\n Vekllei has larger battlecruisers (the so-called super-battlecruisers match her height and are nearly twice her length) and much larger carriers, but the displacement of the vessel was never a priority. Vekllei‚Äôs naval architecture prioritises mobility and capability in their capital ships, and so the Oa-class vessels represent many intersecting vertices of Vekllei‚Äôs naval doctrine.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-06-06-battlecruiser/","title":"The Oa-Class Battlecruiser"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article was featured in Issue #2 of the Atlantic Bulletin  Atlantic Salmon was the best in the world, and Vekllei had a lot of it. Ocean-going fishing boats brought their haul to Ro, where they cruised wide postwar canals and unloaded tonnes of shiny, bright salmon into processing plants. If a new factory was built, so too was a canal or a railroad. Nothing was trucked. Fish was traded fresh in markets or turned into emulsifiers and fertiliser.\nThe canals were worked heavily, and few fishing vessels were incorporated. The vast majority of Vekllei‚Äôs fishing fleet was owned by the people that worked them, trading with the Sea Office. From a quaisiosn or ‚Äúcanal park‚Äù you might see a dozen vessels in an hour. Some were run-down prewar things limping out to the shallow coasts, while others were nuclear-powered salmon trawlers designed for the storms of the Atlantic.

It was an incredible sight on a day so clear you could see the gentle curve of the earth where it met the horizon. A flash of light and a spray dome surged outwards into the quiet Atlantic, which was broken apart by plumes that formed a column of water that climbed high into the sky. The lateral plumes, the ‚Äúmushroom‚Äù, reached far across the horizon, forming thick clouds that would begin to rain into the sea.

Tzipora has poor circulation and cold hands even in the warm months, and by November she‚Äôs traded the skirt and gi for traditional rouisha trousers and a cloak. Rouisha, like a lot of traditional clothing, have origins in agriculture and are characterised by a loose, baggy fit and insulated lining. Cobian is wearing a heavy wool sack-type dress, which is worn like an apron over other clothing. Winter brings forth ‚Äúpetticoat society‚Äù literally. Note the leather plate on her shoulder, to which her christmas aiguillette is attached.\n In this sense, Winter‚Äôs revival of traditional clothing and customs further evidences its practice as the most traditional season of the year. Although the warm calendar flourishes with the futurist sympathies of a modernist Vekllei, not even the atomic age has been able to dispense with its hard-worked pragmatism developed in a millennia of bitter cold.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-05-16-winter-uniforms/","title":"Winter Uniforms in Vekllei"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article was featured in Issue #1 of the Atlantic Bulletin  Baron had inherited the apartment from his uncle, who passed in the year following his parents. It was in a mixed residential-industrial neighbourhood, adjacent to a canvas factory. Out back was a rivulet, which roared in the long rainstorms of early April.\n Each January, the Colour Bureau of the Architecture Assembly announces the year‚Äôs colours, and tradition in mainstream architecture and interior design is to incorporate the announced palettes, which usually contain a hundred or so colours. His uncle‚Äôs apartment had been built and furnished in 2031, and so it had a #2031 Colour Profile.\n In some ways, it was a very conventional apartment in the Vekllei tradition. It had a sauna and bath in the wetroom, a bidet, a sunken living room and a bread oven. In others, it was more peculiar. The apartment was bizarrely allocated across three levels. You alighted the entrance light well into a sunken living space, then climbed back up into the kitchen. The main living room and master bedroom were another step above the kitchen. Adjacent to the main living area was a closet and study, which overlooked the entrance from a half-meter mezzanine.\nIt was in this study that Tzipora set up shop when she arrived in March 2063. Baron had been reluctant to take her even provisionally, not least because it would mean searching for a new apartment in his busy return period after being abroad for ten years. Tzipora, however, had lived in a dormitory for much of her life and had settled in the alcove once she acquired a dresser screen. She refused outright the master bedroom, which sparked a sleepy agoraphobia. By the time Baron had made other accomodations, Tzipora had entrenched herself in the neighbourhood and had developed a severe sentimentality about the apartment and its rivulet, and so that was where he lived for the rest of his life.\nIn this sense, Tzipora had a strange kinship with the apartment. Baron sealed himself off in the master bedroom each night, but she never left the main living space. It was warm in there, especially in the flickering light of the enormous oven and fireplace, and when she moved the screen aside in the morning her little corner became part of the living area.\nShe had a lot of good memories of that apartment.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-05-15-apartment/","title":"2031 Apartment Diagram"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Hello everyone.

It was about here that she heard a morbid industrial siren, echoing up the valleys from far away.\nAt first she thought it might have come from Ada, since Boya Chemical had a large plant there, but as she lay out her things for lunch she heard the distinct whine of a turbojet. It grew louder, and deeper, until a National Fire VTOL tanker roared across the sky, swirling powdered snow on nearby peaks as it arced across the glacier.

Tzipora was not much interested in health, but she was interested in walking, and she made a pilgrimage along the coast every few years to make sense of the world. She was going whichaway and destined for nowhere in particular. Tzipora was very much Baron‚Äôs daughter, in the end.\nShe had stopped to see the Red Cliffs forty kilometres out from Tjornes when she saw a cruiser of the constabulary parked unusually by the shore. The constabulary were not local police ‚Äî they were a national outfit tasked with policing government and ‚Äúbureau business‚Äù. You found them at power plants, outside universities, guarding the prime minister and providing bodies for HO/NI (Home Office at National Intelligence) when they needed doors kicked.\nTzipora was not the sort of girl to be intimidated by a badge, and she wandered innocently to the shore where she found the cruiser empty. She looked across a beach of black sand and saw some sort of operation playing out ‚Äî there was a gun boat not too far from the shore, and a police hydrofoil beached on the sand. She counted maybe a dozen officers. She wondered if they‚Äôd arrest her if she walked down to see what was happening. She climbed onto the hood of the cruiser to get a better look. Perhaps it was immigrants ‚Äî or smugglers.\nIt only took another moment to spot the smashed crates broken across the rocks before she knew what was going on. She was witnessing the dying days of the countercultural decade, and its chemical fuel was now smashed open before her.\n The 2070s were a wild time for the so-called ‚Äúpink years‚Äù in Vekllei, and for the first time in Tzipora‚Äôs memory she started seeing ‚Äúpleasure drugs‚Äù on the streets. There had always been plenty of sin carrying on in Vekllei, even in her early days ‚Äî hallucinogenics, alcohol, and synthesised highs were legal and easy. But you didn‚Äôt see much of the exotic stuff, which grew in a better climate. Hash, coke, H ‚Äî it was all underground stuff for personal use. These drugs were listed among many others in the class-A import prohibition orders, which made them hard to find and illegal to import. These were ‚Äúpleasure drugs‚Äù ‚Äî the Vekllei phrase for overseas narcotics that didn‚Äôt have a place in Upen or a preexisting cultural history. Comparatively, they were just ‚Äòfor pleasure‚Äô.\nH for heroin was a big news item for a long time, and with it you had one the largest moral panics in modern Vekllei cultural memory. Crackdowns came soon after. Tzipora found it difficult to describe the feeling of the time. It was a new generation ‚Äî one she didn‚Äôt belong to, despite her appearance ‚Äî and she didn‚Äôt have much sympathy for hedonists. They might tell her different, but she never thought the pink years were about much more than feeling good all of the time. She wondered if she was growing old and grumpy inside.\n She wondered how the crates had got there. Had the coast guard sunk another smugger? You heard about the navy firing shots in the news sometimes.\nRuined with seawater and picked over by constables, the chemical feast of Vekllei‚Äôs pink years died with the times. Tzipora wouldn‚Äôt miss it.\nShe stepped off the hood and set off back towards the road, where a warm inn and hot food awaited her.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-05-06-chemical-feast/","title":"The Chemical Feast"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article was featured in Issue #1 of the Atlantic Bulletin  According to her friends, Tzipora‚Äôs contemporary afflictions were tragic. Her medical problems; her violent childhood; her sensitivity and melancholy ‚Äî you could feel sorry for her, because a lot of her problems were not her fault. She invoked sympathy.\nTzipora never considered herself particularly tragic. It seemed straightforward, if difficult; she continued to live ‚Äî and so she lived. Tzipora\u0026rsquo;s sympathy was instead reserved for her first and closest friend: Cobian.\nCobian was not well-liked at school, and it did not take long for Tzipora to find out why. She had a childish edge for a sixteen-year-old, and bitterly hated losing. She was not good at school or sports, was not particularly charming, and came across as desperately lonely. She was a quiet misandrist, which would have been fine if she could play the part of a self-assured social matriarch, but her mother‚Äôs despotic conservatism struck out that possibility early on. Such is life.\nAnd because her world was predicated on being liked and living a normal life, her psyche prohibited self-reflection. That was the great difference between Cobian and Tzipora. They may both have been young and neurotic, but Tzipora‚Äôs relentless self-interrogation left great space for personal growth. Cobian was instead trapped in a domestic play-fantasy, in which she could live out a mythical high-school life, and shattering that illusion would collapse her whole reason for being.\n Tzipora recalled visiting Cobian‚Äôs home for the first time. Cobian‚Äôs mother asked Tzipora to remove her shoes and socks and wash her feet before going to play inside. By the time Tzipora found Cobian in her room, the girl had already changed and handed over her uniform to be laundered. Tzipora, in her tomboyish indigence, had never encountered such a brutally hygienic regime.\nCobian was a different girl at home. Her anxiety and neurosis washed out a little, and her confidence was propped up by the routines her mother had set out for her since she was a child. There was a friendly, curious girl buried under a decade of loneliness.\n Tzipora wondered what Cobian thought about lying in bed at night, and why the girl worried so much about things that didn‚Äôt matter. And it was precisely in the smallness of those things and the tremendous anxiety Cobian owed toward them that made Tzipora want to hug her. To be so worked up over something so pathetic was startlingly moving. The idea that the girl had deluded herself into a corner of hopelessness seemed sad ‚Äî and the fact that no one would reasonably care about such a feeble, meaningless, self-inflicted state of affairs made it tragic.\nThrough Tzipora‚Äôs friendship and the world it opened up for her, some of Cobian‚Äôs edges were sanded down. Some of it was a late maturity ‚Äî some of it was Tzipora‚Äôs dismantling of the scaffolding the girl‚Äôs mother had shoved in there. With that effort, and obvious love, Cobian‚Äôs reason for being changed too. One day, in Tzipora‚Äôs presence, it didn‚Äôt seem so important to be liked by everybody anymore.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-05-02-trials/","title":"The Trials of Cobian"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Tomorrow: 2020 Complete Guide to Vekllei\nToday:\n Up in the ro, the Vekllei flower-tundra home to spirits and people alike, green slopes and igneous monument make an ample crucible for myth and magic.\n Out here, there was a very keen sense of place and purpose. ‚ÄúLandscape‚Äù was neither revered nor ignored, since it did not exist here altogether. Every hill, rock and tree was taken at face value in its full honesty, with commodity dead and modernism suppressed. The place supported human life, and human life supported place. It was intuitive symbiosis.\nTzipora‚Äôs house was built by the hands of her friends with wood from the forest nearby and concrete from Adouisneh. They built her a fireplace big enough to keep her loft warm and the bread hot. She was a small girl and had to split her wood with a pedal saw, which she fed wood from her journeys for kindling.\nShe cycled to the village a kilometre down the road each morning, where she worked in the district library. People from villages nested in the hills and valleys made the commute here, to see films and borrow books. It was funny to her that the scope of the books were so worldly and comprehensive, and that the lives here were so small and pleasant. Living like this, the whole world seemed like a distant curiosity, far removed from their concern.\nMuch like the inversion of the sublime, Tzipora found an inversion of priority in Montre-Lola too. Time and space seemed to collapse in on themselves here, and all abstractions and petty knowledge was squashed. All that existed was the immediate relationship between herself and her surrounds ‚Äî the old path and tractor, the flowers and drumlins ‚Äî each heartbeat after the next, life and death adjacent, the future and past as quiet as the present.

Hydroelectricity appeals to the common Vekllei person strategically and culturally.\nFirst, where the nature of fission demands operational stability and exceptionally well-trained personnel that might be vulnerable to nuclear strikes, estimates by the War Department suggest the country‚Äôs hydroelectric dams would survive a nuclear strike, and would be operational shortly after a war.\nSecondly, hydroelectric dams appeal to the Upen intuition. Vekllei‚Äôs principle of dumousiantopet (beautiful and seperate) is epitomised by the concept of a dam, which modifies its environment to benefit its local community, but also transforms a landscape with a permanence associated with natural phenomena. It is a tremendous structure, monumental in size and quiet in operation. Its analogue modernity and gentle nature appeal to Vekllei‚Äôs deindustrial spirit.\nDepicted here is the Ou Hydroburo Office, located outside of Ou in the Vekllei West Ro Highlands and serviced by a special express train that arrives in the morning and departs at the end of the day. Many townsfolk in Ou are employed in operation of the dam, either through the Thunder or Hydroburos. It is also the site of a small Vekllei National University laboratory which examines the dam environment and trains its staff.\nThe site is early Newda in style, built soon after the Atomic War, and is remarkable for its striking water tower and pump house. These pumps draw water from the reservoir into pipes tunnelled into the surrounding mountains, at which point gravity carries it all the way to Ou, Yana, and Vekllei proper‚Äôs own reservoirs.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-04-21-hydro/","title":"The Ou Hydroburo Office"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  The Americas Bureau at National Intelligence (AB/NI), a semiautonomous organ of the covert operations council of the War Department, is recognised as the busiest of the continental bureaus. There is a lot to be busy with ‚Äî the Dallas Secession, the Brazilian invasion of Bolivia, the Dallas nuclear lend-lease, and the reliability of Venezuelan oil production are all of some concern to Vekllei, and so AB/NI proactively has fingers in those pies.\nAB/NI foreign operations are provocative and direct, often guiding or outright employing shadow contractors, criminals, mercenary groups and political action groups. This is in the spirit of Vekllei‚Äôs concentric security concerns, which are benefited by the destabilisation of major powers.\nFrequently implicated and rarely rarely held accountable, AB/NI soaks up hard men returning from the previous decade of vicious fighting in Asia and puts them to work in coat and tie as servants of the Vekllei intelligence community. These include superficially respectable, decent men like Baron Desmoisnes, but also many of those whose violent tendencies and undiagnosed psychological problems are kept isolated from domestic life by their disposal in the regional bureuas.\nTzipora first met Wihle ‚ÄúWilly‚Äù Tesmehsnoisen in Baron‚Äôs orbit shortly after her arrival in Vekllei in 2063. She immediately liked him. His filthy ragged hair and stache were at odds with his business attire, and his short, sharp movements carried a threat of violence. His incongruity radiated freakish charm and power ‚Äî the sort of person Tzipora liked. He thought Tzipora was the funniest thing he‚Äôd ever seen, and not just for her good sense of humour. To him, her diagnosis wasn‚Äôt worth much more than a good laugh. ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt changed a bit,‚Äù he‚Äôd say every time he saw her. She liked that. He also faked an American accent.\nHe worked as an operative at AB/NI, and she only saw him occasionally. As far as she could tell, he was not particularly close with Baron ‚Äî Baron was not particularly close with anyone but her and maybe Ayn ‚Äî but she thought Wihle respected him. They‚Äôd both been boys in the Asian war, and he‚Äôd clearly had a place in Baron‚Äôs history, no doubt in shadowy work to which Tzipora was not privy. When Tzipora performed in the school play as Witch #2, Wihle was in the audience with Baron and Ayn, clapping and stomping his feet.\n ‚ÄúWhere he‚Äôs from?‚Äù She asked Baron.\n‚ÄúHe said he‚Äôs from California, but that‚Äôs a lie. I don‚Äôt know where he comes from.‚Äù Like most of their conversations in his office, he was looking at his work and did not look up to answer her questions.\n‚ÄúCalifornia,‚Äù she said, and something about it ‚Äî the spirit, if not the truth ‚Äî made sense. She asked, ‚Äúwhat does he do at work?‚Äù\n‚ÄúShit all,‚Äù Baron said, and that was the end of that.\n In 2072, Wihle was killed in an altercation with his wife. The unsolved disappearances of several Americans went with him.\nWilly‚Äôs loud anarchism was contrasted by Jiro Kond≈ç‚Äôs obsequious professionalism. Here, lo, was another AB/NI contradiction ‚Äî a man dressed like a gangster with the disposition of a well-paid civil servant. Jiro had started out as a merchant navy sailor on old diesel ships in the Sino Crisis, and after the war had found work with Vekllei‚Äôs Japanese Embassy as a double agent. Soon he‚Äôd been granted citizenship and recognised as a capable regional advisor for OB/NI (Oriental Bureau at National Intelligence) and met Baron through Vekllei‚Äôs work monitoring U.S.-Japan relations.\nAlthough many Vekllei staff in the provincial HO/NI (Home Office at National Intelligence) dismissed him as an unremarkable ‚Äúimport‚Äù from the East ‚Äî a pretentious Japanese bureaucrat ‚Äî Jiro was a fascinating character. Generally, men who‚Äôd actually seen action were unremarkable and gentle like Baron, or easy-going and irreverent like Wihle, but Jiro was neither. He was a very intense, focused man who volunteered almost any information about himself freely, though he was not a conversationalist. Baron shrugged decades of his life away in the most innocent of questions, but a simple ‚Äúdid you ever kill somebody?‚Äù elicited a frank, disarming admission from Jiro:\n ‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶ In 2056. A Korean‚Ä¶ He was monitoring a man of interest to me‚Ä¶ and the man in question was in a very delicate situation. I shot the Korean in his apartment. This was in Osaka.‚Äù\n He was not a warm man, but he remembered every occasion of her life and delivered small gifts. Tzipora loved gifts, the the care of the gesture in a decommodifiied society, and so she reciprocated the gesture to him several times a year. So it was that Jiro‚Äôs birthday gifts consisted only of the scarves knitted by the daughter of his boss. He never married,\nThere were others at AB/NI whom Tzipora liked, not least of which the fabulous and loving Ayn, but few typified the eccentricity and violence associated with the regional bureaus more than Wihle and Jiro. It was a glimpse of the ‚Äúreal‚Äù world. Away from her Vekllei language lessons, and the superficiality of her classmates, were the spectres of real danger, mental illness and genuine intrigue.

Tens of thousands had alighted troop ships at the end of the War of Taiwan, only to find that pieces of their lives had unravelled overseas. Hardy, bronze-skinned boys were left with their ghosts, and those ghosts introduced them to drinking, and brawling, and suicide.\n As part of the Birmingham Convention and the second round of the Commonwealth War Trials, a young and recently defeated Vekllei nation was chained to a conflict that was beginning to fester in East Asia. They didn‚Äôt want to be there, but that‚Äôs what happens when you lose a war. So they became \u0026ldquo;Whites\u0026rdquo; ‚Äî as opposed to \u0026ldquo;reds\u0026rdquo;, or communists, they supposed. But it was also apparent that they were anglos in an oriental war. They fought begrudgingly alongside the Taiwanese, American GIs, Brits, and some Australians. At one point there were more white foreigners in the Datong district in Taipei than Chinese ‚Äî that‚Äôs modern war, Baron supposed.\nHe was not a friend of any People‚Äôs Republic, but the Kuomintang wankers were off the rails. The high schools had closed down and they‚Äôd taken the boys and put them in uniform. They sent those boys south from their provisional headquarters in Wulai, down as far as Yuchi where they rounded up the smartest-looking people and shot them. In the Five Days Terror, Taipei glowed in the light of a hundred thousand books turned to ash in bonfires. They were spotting Mao on street corners.\nBehind any KMT officer there was a Joint Intelligence Bureau slug, and behind the slug was some CIA motherfucker. Vekllei soldiers, who were ostensibly nonaligned but were in no position to argue, took orders from these clowns.\nThe People‚Äôs Republic had control over a decent part of Kaohsiung and the whites were terrified of rumours of Red Chinese in the mountains on the West Coast. The communists did not have the benefit of a century of support from the Americans, and most of the boys they killed were ill-equipped and skinny. At night you could hear the distant booms of gunfire in the sea between the ROC and Xiamen. At this time Atomic shit was still restricted to naval warfare. Occasionally an old diesel ship would go up, and you‚Äôd see it from the shore. Those fireballs looked like they touched satellites overhead.\n Baron had a clinical, empty side to him in which he stored a lot of his pain. He had done unspeakable things, and had merely forgotten them or parcelled them away so that they could not be coherently retrieved. That sort of conscience lands you with spooks; for the rest of the boys coming home from Taiwan, their lives had ended with the war.\nThe problem of dead vets and criminal heroes became such that the War Bureau, equipped with new research on shell-shock, established a series of hospitals across the country that isolated and gave time for these boys to come to terms with what they did and what they saw. They were sanatoriums, in a sense ‚Äî you took a train into the highlands, and you came back when you were ready. A lot of boys found it difficult to be around people who didn‚Äôt understand them. At the hospitals, called ouismaindesdenyo or ‚ÄúCare Homes‚Äù, they could be around those people.\nBaron would visit people occasionally at the Yana ouismaindesdenya. Tzipora would go with him. She thought it was because her being there made him feel less like a patient. She did not know if the people he visited were comrades, friends or if he was simply fulfilling a duty as an ex-officer. He never made it clear to her. She spent time on the lake shore painting and thinking. At dusk the sky would glow, and she would think about what the hell it was she was doing with her life.\nIn some ways, she was a patient at Yana too ‚Äî after all, like these men, she‚Äôd done and seen terrible things. She‚Äôd seen the other side of life‚Äôs coin, in a way. When she underwent sumoirnesdenen (ego death) years later, she thought it felt similar to that moderated, clinical idea of trauma ‚Äî like she had crossed a rubicon, and had been exposed to some secret about violence and death, and that every part of her life was now framed in relation to it.\nShe never claimed to be like the boys at Yana, because she wasn‚Äôt. But she knew what it was like to enter domesticity and never feel at home in it. She was lucky; she had Baron. She wondered about those boys who married before they left. She wondered where those brides were now.\nAfter a week, they would travel downstream from the highlands and leave Yana behind.

While working anonymously as central mailer of Kid Comix, an underground APA (amateur press association, a sort of decentralised magazine created and possessed only by contributors), she made contact with Sgt. Salt, AKA cartoonist Darren Heidoismen. It was only years later that he discovered that editor ‚ÄúSquick‚Äù was Tzipora Desmoisnes ‚Äî none other than Vekllei‚Äôs first Gregori Baby.

It is not particularly sentimental ‚Äî in fact, it is ruthlessly modern, facing deindustrialisation as the liberation of artist and worker alike.

She engaged in the trip with the help of an Upen minister, as is standard practice in Vekllei.\nThe practice is celebrated in two parts ‚Äî first, a period of ego-death under influence of mushrooms (although synthetic drugs are often used today, especially in urban areas), and second comes a sober reassessment of priority (called maloidenen or self-worship) that aims to rebuild the person positively while the memory of the open soul is still vivid. This is done largely through scripture and controlled socialising, and is celebrated, much like a birthday, as a milestone.\nAlthough Tzipora‚Äôs sumoirnesdenen experience was positive and provided important clarity in a very lonely time of her life, she soon after began recalling dreams from her early months in Vekllei for the first time in a decade.\nThey were nasty-feeling images, encumbered with insecurities and a dark paranoia. Never a strong swimmer, she found herself washed up on beaches, meeting dead acquaintances, and grimacing as her waterlogged nightshirt chafed her shoulders. It began to disturb sleep. She wondered if sumoirnesdenen had exposed a clearer subconscious filled with a sinister, more accurate, depiction of her past and future.\nIt had, however, provided a clear frame of mind to understand herself in the context of the universe. The dreams began to fade. Her ego quickly reasserted her place in the world ‚Äî indeed, it had never really disappeared. It provided her with a glimpse at the other side of the coin, and it put her heart at peace.\nI\u0026rsquo;m back after a break. I\u0026rsquo;m relearning how to write worldbuilding posts. I hope you enjoyed, there\u0026rsquo;s more on the way \u0026ndash; Hobart.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-04-01-ego/","title":"Ego Death and Upen's Spiritual Rebirth"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  As I pick up some larger projects, my posts here will slow down a little bit.

Everything is a fog. Expect revisions and possibly major changes in the morning.\nPictured above is Tzipora Desmoisnes, the Princess of the Earth and one of the most interesting persons of the last century. She has made good use of her 126 years on Earth (and counting), and a few samples have been chosen for your viewing pleasure. Conveniently, captions have been attached to briefly describe a few choice (but not comprehensive) depictions of her life.\n2 Years Old / 2049\nAn infant Tzipora arrives in a country she would remember as her homeland. Knowing the tumultuousness of her childhood from here on, it is sobering seeing the round baby\u0026rsquo;s face staring back, red-faced and full-cheeked. Her mother, Mette Sumoisnesn from Vekllei, is a bohemian political scholar and radical looking to start fresh in South America after several life events leave her dissatisfied with life in Vekllei. With her savings secured, they move into a wealthy neighbourhood called Modelia, in Bogota.\n5 Years Old / 2052\nAt five, Tzipora speaks Spanish natively and only a handful of Vekllei phrases like many immigrant children. A naturally lithe and timid girl, she won‚Äôt make friends at school until her second year. In many ways, she is already becoming a picture of opposites from her mother; where Mette is a postmodern lady of wide social interest, Tzipora is conservatively inward-facing. She has, however, already inherited Mette‚Äôs disarming honesty and decisive mindset.\n7 Years Old /2054\nAs Mette kept irregular hours and a laissez faire attitude towards parenting, Tzipora is already fairly independent for her age. Although hardly the only child to maintain a household in Bogot√°, she is certainly unique in her social class. Mette‚Äôs Vekllei-sourced wealth goes a long way in Colombia, but her bohemian lifestyle and liberal social instincts lend to a world of contradictions and colourful schisms that leave Tzipora caught between worlds ‚Äî that of the poor, artistic, and revolutionary as well as the wealthy, polite and domestic. Even at this age, Tzipora already showcases several of these contrasts in her malleable personality, which are as charming as they are awkward. Although her relationship with Mette is untraditional for a single mother and daughter, it is affectionate and Tzipora is happy in Modelia.\n10 Years Old / 2057\nIt‚Äôs 2057. President Cifuentes has been dead for six months, the communists are in power in Bogot√°, and Mette has depleted ten years of Colombian wages to shelter Tzipora in a Catholic boarding school in the U.S. to keep her safe from an imminent American invasion.\nShe now wears the uniform of St Mary\u0026rsquo;s Catholic College in Sacramento, California. She\u0026rsquo;s cut her hair in keeping with the American fashions and has lost some weight as she diets for what the other girls in her dorm call a ‚ÄúCoca Cola body‚Äù. On Tzipora‚Äôs small, girlish frame, her thinness looks pitiful and achingly neglected, not attractive. She is an Inuk-Scandinavian girl with Jewish European ancestry who knows only the language and culture of a wealthy Latina. Compounded with her little eccentricities and timidity, she does not fit in well at school.\n14 Years Old / 2061\nA lot can happen in four years. There was an atomic bomb in Cairo, and the Federal Government has lost control of the so-called Dallas States. Mette has stopped responding to letters and Tzipora‚Äôs out of money. She makes plans to move in with her male mathematics teacher, who predated on her near-idiotic numeracy weaknesses to foster an illicit relationship, but abandons that idea when she discovers he has been grooming multiple other girls.\nShe takes the California Zephyr to Utah instead of San Francisco on advice of a trusted priest, and quickly finds herself indigent and starving. Clothed by a charity in filthy artefacts of the previous decade, she lives in a women‚Äôs shelter that has too little to go around. There‚Äôs not even work as a strikebreaker anymore, since sporadic fighting in Southwest Utah has moved or shuttered all business that isn‚Äôt literally burrowed into the surrounding desert.\n16 Years Old / 2063\nShe‚Äôs aware by now, and has been since her school days, that she has some sort of nutritional deficiency or hormone imbalance impeding her puberty. As a good Catholic girl of the faith, she does not understand anything about puberty, but it doesn‚Äôt take a doctor to figure out she looks half the age of the teen-agers in the shelter.\nShe has miraculously managed to find work as a maid at a nearby motel, and has money for little luxuries that now mean the world to her. Clean underwear, some sneakers that are good for day work, and a steady stream of penny dreadfuls from the local bookshop, operated by the mysterious ‚ÄúBaron‚Äù. She lives in a so-called ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs House‚Äù that starts attracting attention as the turbulent political climate in the Dallas States continues to destabilise.\n18 Years Old / 2065\nTzipora celebrates her eighteenth birthday as a student at Lola 6th School in Vekllei. She is overwhelmed with affection for the country and her new father, Baron, but is struggling to reconcile her natural inadequacies as a new immigrant with her expectations of success in a country that offers her so much. Life is busy, and is full of new things that send her reeling with excitement ‚Äî friends, music, and good food are just a few. At once younger and older than her years, Tzipora‚Äôs independence and stubborn affection make raising her easy for first-time dad Baron, who never intended to have children, let alone start with a teen-ager.\n32 Years Old / 2079\nSuffering from a severe bout of seasonal depression and a deep sense of listlessness after graduating from university, Tzipora‚Äôs long-neglected existential epistemology breaks open all at once. Now a librarian in the Lola central library, she watches Baron get older and wonders about ending her life once he passes. She drowns her panic in her work, working days at a time cataloguing stock at the library while also editing the underground ‚Äòzine Kid Comix. The sardonic nihilism of the underground Comix community is her only comfort as she considers her future and the place in the world.\n86 Years Old / 2133\nAlthough Tzipora always evolved slowly, by 86 Tzipora‚Äôs turbulent youth is well behind her. Her little insecurities and aching sense of inferiority have blossomed into a gentle sense of humour and easygoing disposition common in old ladies. Does Tzipora qualify as one? By the numbers, certainly. But ask anyone in Montre-Lola, the village she‚Äôs lived in since moving there over fifty years earlier, and they‚Äôll tell you that she retains a teen-age vitality and curiosity in her that should have been dissipated long ago. Physically, she is, of course, unchanging ‚Äî and her spastic tics are as present as ever. Montre-Lola may change, and Tzipora may watch generations cycle through, but she is apparently timeless.\n126 Years Old / 2173\nMuch older, and a little wiser, Tzipora has had decades to reconcile her extended stay on Earth with the seeming immortality of the Vekllei cultural landscape. She still lives in Montre-Lola as a maternal root of the community, and resides in the little house built for her by the town over eighty years ago. For Tzipora, her sense of time has slowed to a crawl. A creature of routine, life around her goes on despite it all ‚Äî the atomic war, the rebuilding, the stresses of a post-war world. A lot of her life is boring. She doesn‚Äôt mind. She finds great pleasure in the mundane, and her body is young and healthy. There are always reasons to live, and not just for the people in her life ‚Äî after all, novels continue to be written and her plants need to be watered. Absorbed in her pleasant little life, it barely occurs to her that next year she will become the oldest living human being in history.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-02-17-princess/","title":"Tzipora, the Princess of the Earth"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Despite appearances, most of the population of Vekllei are Scandinavian, not Asian.\nZhu is the first time in a long time I\u0026rsquo;ve drawn an ethnically Chinese person.

Like Tzipora, Shizuku had not physically aged a day since she was a child.\nIt was summer, and six days after Tzipora had arrived in Japan as a Gregori ambassador from Vekllei. Although she would not be the oldest victim of Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome until Quentin Cook‚Äôs (USA) infamous murder-suicide ten years later, she was one of the so-called \u0026ldquo;First Thirteen\u0026rdquo; publicised patients, and so was somewhat known to the international community. By the time of their meeting in 2071, there had been an estimated 250 Gregori baby births, and around 130 living across the world. Kobayashi was the 122nd ageless child, and Japan‚Äôs first.\nTzipora met Kobayashi in the Ozake Ryokan outside Kamig≈çri, Kobayashi‚Äôs birthplace and home. It was not far from Aioi. Tzipora was 24 at the time, and Shizuku was 18, and still in school. Poor Zelda was so nervous about meeting another Gregori baby that she became overwhelmed by Japanese manners. So it was that Shizuku‚Äôs first introduction to Tzipora was via a clonk on the head.\nShizuku was sweet and even-tempered, and they talked for nearly five hours before she was retrieved by her mother in the late evening. She spoke okay English, because she‚Äôd dropped out of school for a year to pursue acting with an American film company based in Yokohama that operated through the NGHQ. Acting was a common profession for Gregori babies ‚Äî it seemed that the miracle children of the world were quickly relegated to freaks of entertainment. Tzipora did not have the stomach for it, but she knew of several others around the world who made good money playing children in film.\nTzipora excitedly relayed the awkwardness of life in Vekllei as an unageing child, from her problems at university to her dreams of the future. She had no metric for how it might differ in Japanese society, because in many ways she was still fourteen ‚Äî the problems of a young teen-age girl seemed universal, even then.\n‚ÄúNo one takes you seriously at first,‚Äù Tzipora said, but she acknowledged that once people got to know her she‚Äôd had no problem being treated with respect.\n‚ÄúI suppose,‚Äù replied Shizuku.\nTzipora could not help but notice that Shizuku looked different from her Japanese peers. It was only later that she would learn that Shizuku‚Äôs father was a GI from Okinawa, shamefully rendering her eternally ‚Äúhafu‚Äù despite the miracle of her existence. She could sympathise, in her own privileged way ‚Äî Tzipora, too, was a girl of many ethnicities and cultures. But even with her television understanding of the land of the rising sun, Tzipora grasped that things might be more difficult here, where old-world memory collided with new-world growth.\nTzipora quieted her obnoxious enthusiasm and asked Shizuku what pictures she was in. Shizuku said she wasn‚Äôt in pictures, just television, and Tzipora wouldn‚Äôt have seen them anyway. Tzipora asked what she wanted to do. She said she didn‚Äôt know. As for Tzipora?\n‚ÄúI want to work in a library,‚Äù Tzipora said. ‚ÄúI love stories, and I like the idea of being in charge of the books.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI love stories too,‚Äù Shizuku said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to write them, really. But we‚Äôll have to see. It‚Äôs difficult‚Ä¶‚Äù\nShe trailed off, perhaps lost in her foreign vocabulary. She didn‚Äôt have to finish the point. It was difficult: it was difficult to make money, it was difficult to find love, and it was difficult to picture a future where the only constant was yourself. It was no wonder that Gregori children, whose personalities were often developed by the projections of those around them, ended up killing themselves when the uselessness and meaninglessness of their existence revealed itself.\nAlthough Shizuku‚Äôs mother received money from the estranged father, and Shizuku herself had made good money through acting, a fugue settled on Tzipora in the days after their meeting. Previously she had not considered herself a ‚ÄúGregori baby;‚Äù she had considered herself merely ‚ÄúTzipora‚Äù. In Vekllei, that was an identity she could afford. But despite Shizuku‚Äôs outward satisfaction with her present state of affairs, Tzipora couldn‚Äôt help but feel ill thinking about the anxious, isolating existence that almost certainly awaited any girl whose childhood stretched into the decades. All at once it seemed very unfair in its quiet cruelty ‚Äî the hafu girl who would never grow up to be a beautiful actress.\nAlthough she‚Äôd kept in contact with Shizuku Kobayashi, Tzipora would not visit another Gregori baby for many decades.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-01-31-immortality/","title":"Face to Face with Immortality"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  She‚Äôd accidentally starched her gi quarter-pleat in the wash. She held it self-consciously against her side as she watched the clouds navigate the sharp mountains that formed Montre‚Äôs deepest valleys. Even out here, where human presence was gentle and subservient to the land, Vekllei National Railways had tracks that serviced the smallest villages. Today it was high summer, and the slopes were green and free of ice. They waited in the shade of the regional limited express carriage for train 802, which would take them home to Montre-Lola and complete a two hour ritual all Montre-Lolan university students made for their studies.\n802 was the second of an 800-series trainset that had been manufactured since 2003. These trains came from old society, long before Tzipora or her father had ever been born, back when VK Rail had been the Montre Regional Transport Company. It was crazy to think that the 802 had been around since before the bombs had fallen, and had survived the chaos of the atomic aftermath. It was funny how human creations became guides through history, linking young women like Tzipora to the solemn echoes of the past.\nThere was something sobering about that idea, she thought. She was thinking about this as she waited in the carriage, as a younger girl fidgeted in boredom and another whistled away in sleep. The sun was hot on the platform outside and the rising air distorted the bright yellow glint that signalled 802‚Äôs approach.\n Despite a week between posts, I‚Äôve been a busy little bee.

That‚Äôs all about to change.\nSee you soon.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-01-27-carriage/","title":"The Girls of the Last Carriage"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  When Tzipora moved to study English and Vekllei literature at the university of Montre in 2075, she had to walk from the little home where she lived to Montre-Lola‚Äôs old concrete platform, which facilitated a single electric railcar each way, each day. If she was feeling lively, she could make it to the platform in a half hour. On the days where she dreaded sighting her plimsolls in the shoebox, it might take forty-five minutes. She made this trip six days a week for five years, because that was the price of acquiring two degrees at once.\nAt first, the walk had been a welcome canvas of boredom. If the weather was good, it could even invoke the sublime. A row of gnarled old pines, planted by dead men, formed rank beside the dirt road. In the spring, the flower-tundras flashed colour through the waving pine needles as the breeze rolled through, which cooled her dreadful perspiration. She felt a very strong kinship with the Earth then, and she steadied the pace of her breaths, and she tasted sweet pine and warm soil in the air. She looked doll-like in her cape and dark leather shoes against the bright sunlight. After a long winter, her skin was not gently porcelain, but instead a waxen and tallowed complexion coloured only by the vigour of the honest walk and the spirit of the good earth around her.\nEvery day, she passed the same gnarled pines, and the same buried fallout shelter by Silverwater Creek, and the same abandoned machine shed that slumped closer to the fenceline with each passing season. It collapsed one day in March, baring its rusted mechanical organs briefly before it was buried in winter snow. She would look at the old tractor and wonder what part it had played in the lives of the stewards of these old fields. She thought about the factory where it might have been made and was struck with sadness.\nAfter five years of walking in this timeless landscape, she no longer resented its obtrusion on her journey to school. She had memorised everything there was to memorise along her path. She recognised lichen on the old stair rail like moles on the face of a friend, and could recite the make and count of the wine bottles in the bed of the creek. It occurred to her, in some small way, that it was only after the beauty of the path had evaporated that she was able to truly visit it. It was the eternal conflict of landscape, she supposed; it was only now, in her utter boredom and total blindness to landscape, that she had finally removed herself from the vista and allowed herself to see place as it was for the first time.\nShe had intuitively discovered for herself a central tenant of Upen, where the sublime had been usurped by the much quieter, and much richer, mundane. The sublime screams like colour through pine leaves; the mundane is the dew that gathers silently on the spokes of the tractor ruin. The sublime is in the perfume of country air; the mundane is in the carcass of a beetle nestled in the moss; the sublime is the self-conscious rouge on her lips; the mundane a dirty scuff on her sock ankle; the sublime the whisper of the wind, betrayed by a new bud beneath a branch; the prism of her light blue eyes by the moistness around her nostrils in the cool weather.\nNo, it was never a matter of birth and decay, or light and dark; it was never about a schism to begin with. It was a fundamental kinship with a transcendental memory of place, and the hidden spirituality of the unimportant, and the sweetness of the unbeautiful.\nThe unconscious recognition became conscious knowledge, and it obliterated her world. The entire axis of cosmology tripped. The world pivoted. Beauty and pleasure were rediscovered in an instant. She looked around her, and she had discovered the mundane. She was no longer standing amidst landscape, but mere place.\nHer heart swelled with pleasure. Her blood sounded in her ears. Through five years of emotional labour and millions of footfalls, she had discovered the mundane in the sublime, if only here. Her eyes and heart had a sudden clarity; she was filled with love not just for the smallest of things, but in fact the smallest things exclusively.\nAlthough the feeling she had in that moment was by its nature irreproducible, she would do her best to recognise the mundane everywhere. She sincerely fell in love with Newda shortly after. The small and honest voice of the simple and inconsequential and imperfect called to her wherever she went, and from then on she was always at peace in place; for she was always surrounded by patina, and change, and the most delicate hinge of life that animated the inanimate in her renewed understanding of the world.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-01-19-sublime/","title":"The Girl and the Sublime"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Tzipora, illustrated here, is happy because her traditional dress makes her feel stylish and her cape is soft and warm.\nVekllei is an ancient culture with many inherited and vestigial artefacts. Nowhere is this more apparent than in her national dress, particularly that for women, where old and new collide as they do all across Vekllei. Pre-war, post-war and future are present here. Let‚Äôs run through some of the elements, which can be found throughout her society.\n Fountain hairpieces. These are the centrepieces of Vekllei ceremonial hairstyles, and are aided by sticks traditionally or more commonly gels today. These are only for women, and are arranged at the top of the head. Hats are not worn with traditional dress, and the Fountain hairpieces date back to the 12th century, in initial Danish settlement. Temple hairpieces. These hairpieces are fastened symmetrically at the side of the head, and accompany the fountain. Traditionally an exclusively male style, it was incorporated into women‚Äôs culture in postwar liberalisation. Uroastopet (birth flower) hairpieces. Flowers are central component of Vekllei animistic iconography, and their employ with people is analogous to Zodiac or astrological traditions. A birth flower is usually attached as a hairpiece in ceremony to distinguish the girl against the stars, acknowledging the chance in her birth not dependent on blood or heritage. Floral collar pins. These are recent items that first appeared in the last half-century, in response to the urbanisation of Vekllei life. Where traditionally flowers would be attached to the collar, here they are replaced by enamel and metal pins that are also worn with business and school shirts. Regional Flower Plate. This unusual item displays a special floral arrangement, called a ro poisnesn (flower-tundra blood arrangement) which can be genuine or artificial. It displays a curated collection of flowers from the girl‚Äôs village or region, usually selected from a local flower-tundra. Camisole Pinafore. These pinafores first appeared as detachable suspenders in the 19th century and have become an indispensable component of styles and uniforms since. Like most elements of Vekllei ceremonial dress, its origins are in agriculture. Refined Women‚Äôs Tie. A woman‚Äôs tie is carefully folded to respect the integrity of its sacred source; the shape and cascading petals of the Oa flower, which is the national Vekllei symbol. Men have a similar item that fastens to the neck of a tie. School/workplace armband. Armbands are universal in Vekllei. Instead of a symptom of authoritarian workplace culture, they are instead seen as markers in the country of public face. They are found in most professions and schools and have even seen ironic popularity in progressive fashion scenes. Dien agricultural shirt. These loose, baggy cotton shirts rolled at the elbow are a uniquely Vekllei style of dress, and appeared just prior to the time of the Camisole pinafore. Originally a male item, it is mostly worn by women today in professional and casual settings alike. Uroaten floral belt. These belts are mural testaments to the lineage of a girl, usually displaying the birth flowers of her female relatives. Bell Sash. The bell sash jingles as she moves and it sounds nice. The girls pick the bells themselves, and different sounds have different meanings. Oanan lace apron. These aprons are rarely worn, because they are extremely delicate, but they are precious cultural items often handed down through generations. Girls are often married in them. In postwar life, they are iconic for how the woman has been liberated from work ‚Äî where even her aprons are stripped of utility and transformed into beautiful decorations. Honey half-cape. Vekllei is very cold, and half-capes or full-capes are often worn. You‚Äôll find them in school uniforms and throughout professional workplaces in the country. They are interchangeable with other long coats, but are beloved for their versatility, warmth and softness. Gi quarter-pleat. These are very sacred items, and are designed specifically for the girl at her menarche. They usually incorporate their birth flower, birth festival and other iconography into their patterns. Girls wear them to school. Boys also have gi, but they are much smaller and not nearly as intricate. Glory Sash. A glory sash is affixed to the uroaten and proclaims the beauty of the girl‚Äôs family through religious iconography and runes, called upotenne. Thousand-pleat skirt. Traditionally skirts without pleats are worn, but postwar manufacturing has gifted young women with many types of skirt and pleat less varieties have been largely substituted for decorated or ‚Äúthousand-pleat‚Äù versions. Sun petticoat. These are petticoats that hang below the hem, and often accompany the oanan lace apron as a set. Like the oanan, these are very delicate and are usually only worn on special occasions. Pure white, they dirty easily below the hem and are mostly decorative, although they do have utility in supporting the weight of the girl‚Äôs skirt with pleat and sash attached. Mido socks. A longer cotton sock is folded three times to make a cuff, which offers versatility in a climate that changes without warning. At the hem‚Äôs current fashion, a mido sock can instantly become a stocking of sorts, depending on the make and taste of the girl.

There are several types of traditional Vekllei shoe, from old boots and sandals to modern makes of foreign design, like penny loafers.

Long gi (decorative quarter-pleats you‚Äôve seen around) accompany sun petticoats, or Vekllei lace aprons. Flowers take the place of astrology or the Zodiac in Vekllei, and so they often accompany spiritual runes (in upotenne, or religious script) about the girl. Other aspects are just as unique, but not nearly as noticeable. The loose style of shirt, folded at the elbow, is a deliberate imitation of Vekllei agricultural fashion, and three-fold socks and soft felt or leather shoes are worn by women of many ages and professions. Much like her ecology, Vekllei is also culturally atomised, and in her isolation has developed subtle variations of what might otherwise be dismissed as plain clothing items. Every part of her outfit has heritage and symbolism, often barely detectable to a foreigner.\n Hi everyone,\n4 hours from now I‚Äôm off to Japan again.

Large pools, opalescent with healthy minerals, were heated by the core of the Earth. In a volcanic desert of black sand, the geysers were an oasis, rising from the sulphuric fog like a little eden.\n Her study was well beyond mere communication by now, venturing further into the pleasures of language and poetry. It made her smile to think back at where she‚Äôd been just five years before. She recalled images of a nervous immigrant thumbing through her dictionary at a tram stop, terrified of the nonsense characters around her.\nGeysers are the heart of Vekllei spiritualism. The town of Geyser in Vekllei is in fact the origin of the word. They are symptomatic of Vekllei‚Äôs naturalistic statehood ‚Äî a testament to the impermanence of landscape and the symbiosis of people and soil. The geysers, once barren jewels of harsh volcanic landscapes, were now ringed by foliage at their edges as the seeds unwittingly carried by travellers blossomed in rich volcanic earth.\nVekllei people will visit from a young age. Nothing is signposted ‚Äî there is no natural infrastructure. Several deaths a year are reported. As a Vekllei child you develop a relationship with your spring, and learn its unique qualities. Where it is safe to draw water, for example, and where it will boil your skin in a flash. You learn its colour and smell. In rural communities, they are an essential organ, where birth and marriage and death coalesce. Vekllei heritage is not dominated by blood, but by earth, and no clearer are the sites of life than amidst her ancient volcanoes, where the wind carries steam across dark igneous slopes.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-12-23-geyser/","title":"A Kodak Moment by a Vekllei Geyser"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  To substitute for my shocking (and deeply shameful) absence over the last two weeks, please accept a longer-form post concerning domestic Apartment Ideology in Vekllei, which they call Newda and is known internationally as The Vekllei Newda School. Pictured is the apartment of our very own Zelda. While the building itself deserves a feature, for now we‚Äôll discuss Newda as a theory and her life in this building. If you get bogged down and pissed off at the jargon, skip to the ‚Äúpractice‚Äù section. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how I feel about this post, I might have indulged too much, but either way, I\u0026rsquo;m BACK. \u0026ndash; Hobart\nArgument  ‚ÄúA man of the eighteenth century, plunged suddenly into our civilisation, might well have the impression of something akin to a nightmare.‚Äù\n‚Äî Frederick Etchells, Towards a New Architecture.\n Some critics of architecture (and adjacent slugs) deride Newda as decadent. It is as incestuous and plastic as most other modernist constructions, they say. It mistakes austerity for utility, and le blanc for cleanliness. This is not an unreasonable criticism, especially since foundational Vekllei cultural principles of natural immersion and human decay seem irreconcilable with the white, shining concrete of her modern cityscape. How does a style like Newda claim to be anything other than a reckless adoption of continental urbanism for its own sake; a symptom of the social decay we call postwar austerity?\nFor these people, Newda represents a grotesque squandering of a rare, virgin landscape which had been wiped clean in the atomic war. It is impossible to imagine any other means by which the opportunity to rebuild today‚Äôs modern cities might arise. She could have been Paris, critics say ‚Äî entirely unaware that they are discussing a city more beautiful than Paris. ‚ÄúOh, to see Rome reduced to urbanist tower-blocks‚Äù; ‚Äúa garden city of concrete and asbestos‚Äù; ‚Äúa cauldron of plastic and rebar‚Äù; and so on go the tears. ‚ÄúNever had tacky decadence looked so plain.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThere exists a new spirit,‚Äù Le Corbusier wrote in Towards a New Architecture. ‚ÄúOur own epoch is determining, day by day, its own style. Our eyes, unhappily, are unable yet to discern it.‚Äù\nWhat a tantalising phrase that was, when it finally reached Vekllei‚Äôs shores from his native France. Not just for its celebration of a young era, which appeals to Vekllei‚Äôs fluid and agnostic antihistoricism, but for its appeal to ‚Äúspirit‚Äù, which gestures towards the intimate and gentle Vekllei nature. Hence the critics‚Äô fundamental mischaracterisation of Vekllei‚Äôs great modernist project ‚Äî namely that the country understands nature as an organ alienated from their ‚Äúcivilisation,‚Äù or that they recognise their √¶sthetics as a progression of history. Neither is true, as is plain to anyone who has been to any part of Vekllei. Landscape is suppressed in Vekllei, even in an industrial age, and so there is no schism between the human and the natural worlds despite the fact that they live in tower-blocks and wear clothes of rayon and gingham. And ‚ÄúHistory‚Äù in Vekllei is gutted as easily as they might a tuna for which their cuisine is known; their collective story as a state is one of movements and gestures, laterally and lineally at times, and ‚Äúbackwards‚Äù at others (although to apply such a word to Vekllei is to criminally misunderstand her project).\nIt is the application of sickly sentimentalist instincts to Vekllei that betray the reactionary criticism of Newda as a ‚Äúsuperficial, austere school of architecture‚Äù for what it is; a deeply historicist suspicion ingrained in the same modernist instincts it claims to critique; at once fucking and wagging a finger at the pig. It is also a brash rejection of Vekllei sociology as a foundation of petticoat ideology, and mistakes Vekllei‚Äôs ‚Äúmaterial culture‚Äù (her buildings, her clothes, her toys) as something somehow disconnected from so-called \u0026ldquo;petticoat intuition\u0026rdquo;, which is just a phrase for the social unconscious that forms consensus in the country on everything from television soaps to her beloved tower-blocks. This is aesthetics in action, what Hegel praised in The Philosophy of Right as ‚Äúphilosophising, which could well have continued to spin itself into its own web of scholastic wisdom, [coming] into closer contact with actuality.‚Äù Newda is real, and it is alive in the instincts of the ordinary Vekllei person.\nParis can burn. Newda will survive a thousand atomic strikes, through that cockroach known as ideology.\nDo not let Vekllei architecture, which might be assaulted by promiscuous subjectivity or the bores of American objectivity, be discussed in anything but a sociological arena. When talking about Vekllei things, it is a mistake to rely on uniquely Western (or otherwise) constructs. As Adorno noted in Aesthetics, taste is preprogrammed ‚Äî the ‚Äúsublime,‚Äù so it is invoked, is spiritual phenomenology, dependent on so-called objectivity only insofar as objectivity relates to your postcode and personal wealth. Tell a man he is listening to a Stradivarius and replace it with any other violin, and watch the sublime grow mold.\nTheory Decoration has nothing to do with sophistication, nor spirituality. Vekllei is characterised by honesty as a premise in itself ‚Äî not in how they talk or how they do business, but in the frankness and clarity of Vekllei culture in ideology and its cities. ‚ÄúHonesty‚Äù is to make plain the exact functioning and beneficiaries of the economy; the production and movement of commercial goods; the labour and value of ‚Äúcommodities‚Äù; and the material and operation of machines and structures.\nSo too should it inform the foundations of life. Housing is one of the greatest urgencies in the mind ‚Äî and so architecture should respond to urgency with the solidity and reliability required of it. That essence, or ‚Äúform,‚Äù is the premise of a structure, and it requires the reestablishment of architecture not as ‚Äústyle‚Äù but as an ideology built upon a place of living defined by form, purpose, and purity. Newda is characterised by large light wells, common areas, the integration of civic essentials (like food-production, hydroponics, gardens, shallow pools for washing and bathing), and expression through shape. In form, Newda is defined by strong vertical geometry, the baring of utility including pipes and water tanks, and strong colour. Newda structures are constructed in b√©ton brut, even in smaller villages, abiding by the principles of dumousiantopet, or ‚Äòbeautiful and seperate‚Äô. A Newda structure is large enough to house a community but appears gentle and lightweight, since it perches majestically on large columns.\nThere are many types of Newda buildings designed in many different languages and principles of architecture, but I‚Äôm approaching the character limit here so we‚Äôll pursue them another time.\nPractice Let‚Äôs take a tour with Zelda on her journey inside her building.\nFacing the street is a conservatory atrium of ten stories, which is filled with trees. It opens out into the air at its base, since the entire structure is raised on elegant columns that encourage the ground floor as a place of public living. The path to the central elevator towers are lined on each side by a wading pool with a depth of one meter ‚Äî the pool tiles are bright-coloured and contrast each other. They make a good place to cool your feet in summer. Since the load of the structure is vested in columns in the interior, glass encircles the atrium fa√ßade like a ribbon, serving as a natural lightwell and growing space for produce-bearing plants which supplement the Vekllei diet.\nZelda calls an elevator at the free-standing tower, since she lives on the eighth floor. The elevator is glass-lined and she soars up through the canopy of the indoor forest as it moves. The apartments of the eighth floor open into lome a‚Äô pas√¶net or an ‚Äòinternal street‚Äô. These are found in most Vekllei apartment buildings. The street is a long balcony, decadently wide, that runs the length of the interior and connects the five apartments of that floor. Large glass windows in the apartments look out into the internal street, or are hidden with curtains in times of privacy. The street is a popular place to read or meet friends and neighbours, since the yawning interior multiplies the sense of space tenfold, and it received direct sunlight throughout most of the day. At sunset, the glass fa√ßade of the public interior casts a warm, fantastical light on the ten streets of the ten-story building, transforming the space into a prismatic cathedral of light.\nStepping in to the footwell of the apartment, Zelda removes her shoes. There‚Äôs some rumour about the custom dating back to the Viking days as a sign of peaceful intention, but today it‚Äôs for cleanliness. The living room is sunken, and is lighted by the windows looking out into the interior street, which receive sun about the time she comes home. The kitchen overlooks the living space and indoor fig, and includes a large partition/cupboard that can roll on rails across the width of the apartment. There are many small examples of similar modularity throughout the apartment, balanced carefully with Newda‚Äôs affection for permanence. Pipes run beneath the concrete for underfloor heating, providing toasty floors in Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s dark, brutal winters. The apartment is divided between a semi-public half, which includes the living, dining and cooking areas, and a ‚Äòprivate half‚Äô which contains the two bedrooms, bathroom and laundry.\nZelda took the larger bedroom despite her initial protestations ‚Äî Baron insisted, and so that‚Äôs where she spends all her time when he‚Äôs not home. It‚Äôs by far the biggest space she‚Äôs ever had to herself. In fact, thinking back, this is the first room she hasn‚Äôt had to share since she was ten. In other buildings it would be large enough to house a cramped studio apartment.\nNext door is the bathroom. There, you\u0026rsquo;ll find a French bidet, which is separated by a wall from what looks like, at first glance, a modest oriental wet room and bath. The precise opposite is true. It is a Vekllei (that is to say, Scandinavian) wet room. Instead of cleaning your body with a shower and bucket and then soaking in a hot bath, a Vekllei person scalds their skin until it glows and then plunges into a tub of cold water. The contrast of temperature encourages vasodilation and then constriction of the circulatory system, which, in addition to the hydrostatic pressure supplied by the bath, invigorates the skin and can help with muscle fatigue. Some experts believe it may aid the immune system. Vekllei bathers generally do not spend luxurious amounts of time in the bath or shower ‚Äî cleaning is a utilitarian process, which, while shocking and stressful in its temperature contrast, leaves the bather refreshed and with sensitive skin that lends to a feeling of sterility. Public baths work much the same way, through the scalding and cooling principle.\nAn empty storage room, indicative of Baron and Tzipora\u0026rsquo;s spartan minimalism, conceals a small personal laundry. A private laundry is considered luxurious in Vekllei, especially in urban areas where such things are easily communalised, but these apartment towers are new and these are among its benefits. Finally, there is Baron\u0026rsquo;s bedroom and study. Like his daughter, he is a creature of routine, perfectly acclimatised to a home of any size. There is enough space here for a full-size electrotype and the books he needs to work from home on the occasions that permit it. Just beyond his door, in the living area, is a prayer table for their respective friends and family who have passed on.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-12-20-apartment/","title":"Life and Death in Vekllei Apartment Ideology"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Click here for a view inside the wing.\nAlthough the CN-1 Horizon Wing passenger jet was not a ‚Äúflying wing,‚Äù that didn‚Äôt stop Comen Aeroyards, the manufacturer, from celebrating it as such. Much like similar large-wing aircraft from McDonnell and de Havilland, the CN-1‚Äôs large vertical stabilisers and obvious centre fuselage precluded it from qualifying as an authentic ‚Äúflying wing,‚Äù which were already common in many air forces at this time. To argue the etymology, however, is to miss the point entirely ‚Äî the ‚Äúflying wing‚Äù is a style of flying, not a technical appraisement.\nVekllei Overseas Airways (VOA), a subsidiary of the Vekllei Air Service, operates many types of aircraft for different markets. You can see their uniforms here. Some of these are small and propeller-driven. Others are particularly expensive and unusual ‚Äî the astroplanes used to reach cities on the moon are among the more fantastical. The CN-1 occupies a space between the needle-like supersonic jet for business and the large airship for leisure travel. It allows the wandering family (or the comfort-conscious individual) to make good time while retaining the liberty to eat, smoke, read and wander comfortably about the aircraft. In the wings you‚Äôll find a canteen, a bar, a reading room, and sleeping cabins that can be booked in advance. Because of these amenities, the CN-1 serves only long-distance international routes originating from the Vekllei Global Jetport, including to Los Angeles, Rio de Janeiro, Cairo, Moscow, Tokyo, Shanghai, and Sydney.\nThe power plant aboard is a 6MW air-cooled molten salt reactor using an indirect air-cycle system. The CN-1 is nicknamed ‚Äúthe hunchback‚Äù by mechanics for its large air intake atop the main fuselage. The air-cycle system, aided by sunburst-style radiators courtesy of General Reactor, limits radioactive pollution in operation and does away with most of the heavy shielding required by early nuclear passenger jets at the turn of the 21st century. Her large wing gives her tremendous lift and a smooth glide, allowing low-power flight at cruising altitude for a quiet trip. Although she is the first in a series of aircraft for the New Salmon Design Bureau and Comen Aeroyards, she is largely adapted from the XCn-series of military prototypes that have been languishing in development for nearly a half-century. Though the design is sound, her military applications are less certain, and so now the CN-1 flies folk around the world peacefully.\nThe front-facing glass in the common areas lend to vistas never seen before by the ordinary person. For a citizen of Vekllei, flying with VOA is as simple as phoning ahead to reserve a seat. For those around the world, your options for getting on the CN-1 are grim ‚Äî Vekllei is a closed, protectionist country and, save for a handful of CN-1s operating with CAAC Airlines in China, your only option is to purchase a ticket to Vekllei for an exorbitant price, which can run as high as US$10,000 today‚Äôs money for a one-way ticket.\nI‚Äôm working on a few more aircraft for r/vekllei‚Äôs SkyMonth.

It is nearly four times as wide as the older wide-body passenger jets of yesteryear, and twice as wide as most American and European supersonic jets. It is no coincidence that the ‚Äúflying wing‚Äù concept was only made possible by the development of supersonic jetport infrastructure, with their wide and long runways, at the turn of the century.\nSince their introduction, the flying wings have been exclusively a vehicle for leisure and tourism worldwide. The man of business takes a supersonic jet, which permits attendance of company business on two or even three continents in a single day. The wealthy family prefers the comfort and quiet of a large subsonic aircraft like the CN-1, which ensures a timely arrival without the cramped cabins of a fast aircraft.\nAnd transport of the wealthy they are, for only rich cities can afford the land area and facilities of a jetport capable of hosting a flying wing. Jetports are a limited network linking the global elite: Los Angeles, New York, Vekllei, London, Paris, Moscow, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Sydney and Johannesburg, along with some others.\nVekllei International Airways (later renamed Vekllei Overseas Airways, or VOA) flies 22 CN-1s, the first generation of the Vekllei flying wing. We‚Äôll look at more technical details in the next post. 200 passengers can be aboard during flight, and it offers both sleeping cabins and row seating. In the cloudlounges abreast of the main fuselage are a bar and upscale canteen respectively.\nEven minor adjustments to the aircraft‚Äôs bank are felt violently in the wingtips, and so passenger areas are concentrated near the aircraft‚Äôs centre fuselage. Nonetheless, the common areas are closed and passengers are returned to belted seats in the centre fuselage for landing, since adjustments made in flight can easily send passengers (and anything not tied down) into the ceiling.\nThe panoramic windows of the CN-1 lounges lend to dizzying views unlike any other on this Earth. It is comparable to visiting Moidonnest (Vekllei‚Äôs Moon City) and looking back at the Earth for the first time.

They also have a significant population in the least likely of places; a similarly cool, rainy, forested rock known as Vekllei (or Iceland, historically).\nThey grow like a radish and their ears rotate independently on the top of their heads, searching for noises that could eat them. They are an excellent meal for any predator, and are ill-equipped for the larger, invaded ecosystems to which they are extinct.\nVekllei, however, in its geographic and environmental isolation, has only a population of arctic foxes and some wolves to threaten them. The island\u0026rsquo;s biosecurity laws are among the strictist in the world, mostly to protect vulnerable birds (like puffins) and the biodiversity of their unique cattle, sheep, dogs and horses. There are entire brigades of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s armed forces dedicated to the culling of feral dogs and cats, and many species common to the rest of the world ‚Äî rabbits and red foxes come to mind ‚Äî are not found in Vekllei, which employs ruthless culling methods to contain them.\nThey were introduced intentionally to the Les Noisnosn agricultural belt (just north of Ro) in the early 2010s. Their import was a diplomatic effort between Australia and Vekllei as part of a wider series of gestures designed to reconcile tensions between the country and the British Commonwealth just prior to the First Atomic War. The introduced pademelons were very good at eating non-native grasses which had ravaged the temperate rainforests of the region, and were able to survive on the native mosses and plants once the infestation was dealt with.\nSixty years and an atomic war later, they have spread like wildfire. A healthy population exists across the entire island, and can occasionally even be seen in city parks. Their presence in the arctic, as an Australasian marsupial, is utterly unique. They are so common (and tasty) that there are no restrictions on their hunting, and are a staple of diets in and outside of the country‚Äôs urban areas. In smaller agricultural villages, like Tzipora‚Äôs Montre-Lola, they are hunted locally and prepared for eating in the traditional principles of Upen landcare. The meat is low in fat, mild, and sweet, and is often substituted for beef in Vekllei.\nThey are timid, docile creatures that sleep in the day and come out at dusk. Outside of cities, they are often kept as pets. Although Tzipora would never keep a pademelon, she would feed a dozen of her favourite regulars each night when they came out to chew on the mosses of her property. She also took part in fostering a joey which went on to live at the village post office.\nLet me know if you have any questions.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-12-06-wallabies/","title":"Wallabies of the Arctic"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here   Tzipora never lost her youthful curiosity. She would swish about the apartment, chasing an idea or plan that had occurred to her. Baron would look over and say ‚ÄúWhat are you doing, Zelda? Making trouble?‚Äù He said that a lot.

She was crying the whole time. She was very young for a maid, but girls needed money like anyone else. She was starving. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t the kind of hunger you saw in the National Geographic; it was a long, slow year of starvation, where most of her muscle had wasted away and she‚Äôd been left with a bit of youthful fat around her belly and cheeks. That\u0026rsquo;s just how people looked in Utah in 2063. Atomic power collided with indigence across most of the Southwest.\nThis girl did not have a last name, because she was some immigrant worker with a fake visa worth less than her shitty hand-me-down rayon uniform. She knew what was coming in the back of the police cruiser and started to tremble uncontrollably as they left the highway. An immigrant expects what happens to immigrants. They pulled up by a stump and a small patch of dead ashes that were visible from the highway that crossed the flats. Would they take a picture of her for a postcard? She didn‚Äôt want that. Who would cut her down? Would they bury her? Suddenly the finality of it hit her ‚Äî who, at all, would remember her?\nShe was not sure if she was being made an example or an excuse, but could not recall for her life what she‚Äôd done to deserve either. The car engine ticked over as the bigger of the cops slung a thin noose around her neck and yanked on it until it hurt her throat. She pleaded with them in good English, trying to suppress her Latina vocalisations, and cried desperately.\n‚ÄúI am American,‚Äù she whined, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm from California. Do I look Latina? Look, I‚Äôm white. My mother is from Germany. Please, you have the wrong person.‚Äù\n‚ÄúHow old are you?‚Äù The big cop asked.\n‚ÄúEighteen.‚Äù\n‚ÄúIf you start fuckin lying I‚Äôll string you up now.

They gave her a sandwich to eat. It wasn‚Äôt out of kindness ‚Äî it was to bask in the absolute violence of their authority. You could find as much pleasure in pardoning a girl as you could beating her. For a moment, on their command, her poverty and fear was excused. She chewed through bologna as she listed out her neighbours, and after a while her tears were for them.\nWhen she was almost done she began to wonder again if they‚Äôd kill her.

She has looked into her heart and made peace with who she is. She has discovered she is a girl who likes free jazz, and milky coffee, and cotton shirts, and trains ‚Äî to the surprise of no-one who knows her. She knows what things she values in a friend, and what deserves to become family. She knows what clothes she likes and how to do her hair. A year ago, she was a shivering little girl, but today she has become a glowing young woman.\n A glowing pleasure though she may be, her nerves are still shot and her past is still with her. Tzipora is a habitual creature, prone to obsessions and addiction, and she‚Äôd suffered many vices by the time she met Baron. For a while it had been sleeping pills with the other girls in the Women‚Äôs House, chasing the mind-bending effects of a methaqualone high and sleep deprivation. It was about that time she picked up cigarettes, which helped with the tics she was cultivating in her violent poverty.\nShe never quite kicked them. Like the tics, they stuck around. For a girl whose joy filled mountains and lows loomed cliffs, a cigarette now and then took some of that edge off. Ayn never liked her habit. Baron never asked her about it ‚Äî he knew, she thought. He knew what it was like to feel the walls closing in.\nIt made for some awkward encounters, not least of which was a moment of panic the first time Cobian stayed over. Zelda has always suffered very bad dreams most nights, and her fear of waking her friend led her out onto the frigid balcony in the early hours of the morning. Six drags in, the lights turned on and the door slid open. An awkward minute of fumbling followed, pushing Zelda into territory she was uncomfortable sharing with anyone but Baron.\n‚ÄúSo it helps?‚Äù Cobian asked, mulling over the idea with her legs to her chest. Tzipora was fidgeting miserably in the cold.\n‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWhere do you get them? The cigarettes?‚Äù She asked, as though Tzipora would mistake the question.\n‚ÄúThey‚Äôre Baron‚Äôs.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAnd what happens if you stop?‚Äù\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Zelda sniffed. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to make it a big deal, anyway. I don‚Äôt like this. I don‚Äôt like doing it, but what helps, helps.‚Äù\n‚ÄúCan I try? I‚Äôve never tried.‚Äù\nA moment later Tzipora laid a hand gently across the girl\u0026rsquo;s mouth to quiet the vicious coughing and hacking for fear it would wake Baron.\n‚ÄúShh. It‚Äôs okay, I know it‚Äôs not good,‚Äù she soothed. Even as a genuine teen-ager Tzipora had been maternal.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs terrible,‚Äù Cobian gasped.\n‚ÄúI know. But it helps. Let‚Äôs go inside, I‚Äôll get you some water.‚Äù\nAlthough Tzipora would always operate according to the charter of her various obsessions, she was always slightly self-conscious about the cigarettes. Even sixty years later she only smoked alone. It was unbecoming of a satisfied person, she supposed, let alone a woman in the body of a girl. Still, for all her quirks and all her ticks, to most people her little vices were the most normal thing about her. She was a figure of contradictions, and her weaknesses were just as precious to her loved ones as her tremendous strength and bigness of heart.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-11-26-despair/","title":"Medicating despair in the pasture of plenty"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here   Sorry it took so long, mateys. I\u0026rsquo;ve been laying the first pages of the comic down and it\u0026rsquo;s like crack for me. Not much sleep and totally fell behind on SkyMonth. But, as any longtime members know, our Months are r/vekllei usually last a little longer than they should past their expiry date. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot to come!\n The Angel and Memory of the People of Vekllei is the largest and most recent of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s airships. It‚Äôs usually just referred to as the Angel of Vekllei, since transliteration of Vekllei hieroglyphs carry with them a lot of wordy semantic baggage.\nThe Vekllei Air Service (Skyburo), the public bureau that operates the country‚Äôs commercial air fleet, also operates a dozen commercial airships of various size and capacity, colloquially referred to as ‚Äòskyliners‚Äô. Where American skyliners are built as a luxurious alternative to the supersonic jet (although moving many thousands of times slower than one), Vekllei skyliners are similar to cruise ships, drifting lazily over continents and taking pleasure in the journey. Hilariously, the simple livery of the VAS aircraft is scaled up to absurd proportions on its airships, including the crowned circle on its keel.\nThe Angel exemplifies the spirit of the so-called Skyliner-mindset, since it serves a dual purpose; to carry five hundred Vekllei people across the world, and as a diplomatic vessel emphasising both the scientific achievement and peaceful intentions of the island country. For this reason, and unlike the rest of the Skyliner fleet, the dirigible only offers passage to Vekllei citizens.\nTo this end, it offers hundreds of passenger cabins across the middle of the ship, each with spectacular views. A grand ballroom sits beneath the fore, and the glittering crystal nosecap contains one of sixteen viewing galleries scattered about the ship. The indoor arcade and Vekllei stone-water gardens sits above the vacuum tanks, and spans nearly 250 metres in length. In the centre is a small heliport that can accommodate six helijets of a standard size. In the various glass constructions beneath the vessel you\u0026rsquo;ll find the Hall of Atomics, a library, smoking and reading rooms, and a cinema, among various other amenities.\nLarge geodesic vacuum tanks constructed of boron nitride ceramics support near-vacuums throughout the interior of the vessel. These tanks provide a maximum lift of nearly 6,000 tonnes, shedding the restrictive weight limits of yesteryear‚Äôs zeppelins for all the comforts of the modern age.\nVekllei airships have extremely rigid tanks to support the creation of vacuums, which are controlled mechanically through valves. The infrastructure required to support the systems aboard is entirely electric, and powered primarily by a water-shielded atomic steam plant that powers two turbines. The primary reactor has a viewing gallery above it, where passengers can admire General Reactor‚Äôs triumph (A 16-megawatt HA5400 Series) without danger to themselves. An auxiliary reactor is positioned in the aft of the vessel in the machine room.\nAfter popular novelist Jacob Herdesnoisn\u0026rsquo;s Memories of the Sky recalled a summer aboard the Angel, it is very popular for aspiring writers to apply for a job aboard, and use their generous days off to watch the entire world pass by from the window of their cabin, typing on an electric writer. Up to 15 per cent of its staff may be writers in the summer tour. The Angel of Vekllei will usually pick up passengers at major airship terminals by lowering its inbuilt terminal to the ground, and return a few days later after touring the country.\nIt is very important to the Angel\u0026rsquo;s mission that it be seen by as many foreigners as possible. It might spend two or three days soaring above small towns and villages to impress upon the people there the quiet benevolence and love of science of the Vekllei people. A dirigible is quite unlike any other vessel to tour the skies today. It is luxurious and slow-moving; at once outmoded and unsurpassed. In an age of resource depletion and the race for efficiency, the vacuum dirigible is an incredible sight; a peaceful giant watching over the darkened cities of all the Earth.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-11-24-dirigible/","title":"Ocean-liners of the Sky ‚Äî Vacuum Dirigibles in Vekllei"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Overview Although Vekllei‚Äôs flag-carrying airline might appear just one of many in the small island country, don‚Äôt be fooled ‚Äî all civilian aviation operates under a venrouive bureau excitingly titled the Vekllei Air Service (Skyburo), which operates several distinct ‚Äòairlines‚Äô but wholly controls all of them. In Vekllei economic lexicon, a bureau is the largest trade union of an industry, made up of many hundreds of others, and is partially beholden to the direction of government.\nThis makes the Skyburo a ‚Äòpublic airline,‚Äô but is not government owned in the way the rest of the world might understand it. Vekllei segregates business only along personal and public lines, with the political organs of the country largely segregated from daily affairs.\nIllustrated here for your viewing pleasure are the largest of Vekllei‚Äôs ‚Äòairlines,‚Äô represented by their stewards in uniform.\nVekllei Air Service The Vekllei Air Service is Vekllei‚Äôs domestic airline, and operates within the country as well as to Vekllei‚Äôs semiautonomous Atlantic possessions like Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the Azores. The fleet are mostly twin or tri-engined nuclear jets. Vekllei has a comprehensive rail network, and the domestic VAS is mostly used to ferry people between Vekllei‚Äôs various islands.\nThe Domestic Office The Domestic Office is an unusual organisation largely responsible for unusual or unique aircraft that require specific training to command. These include sea planes, dirigible airships, helijets and so on. Their navy and white uniforms are remarkably simple, even spartan, and are the last remaining legacy of private commercial aviation in Vekllei‚Äôs pre-war years. There was not much money for uniforms then, and they carry on in this humble tradition today.\nVekllei Overseas Airways Vekllei Overseas Airways is the international flag-carrier of the country, and compete with the likes of Pan-Am and BOAC. Their uniforms are the public face of Vekllei for many foreigners, and so they reflect both the dignity of the island nation and the high price required of foreigners for travel on the national carrier. It is customary to receive a bottle of Montre wine with a ticket. They also employ capes on male and female stewards, but they must be removed on the tarmac. They operate ‚Äòflying wings‚Äô, large jets and a handful of airships called sky liners.\nThe Special Charter Service The Special Charter Service is an unusual branch of the Skyburo, and is usually regarded as a government airline. Although civilian, it coordinates closely with Vekllei‚Äôs military and intelligence services to assist in moving personnel, and also would be responsible for evacuating Vekllei tourists in the event of an incident overseas or at home. Day-to-day, it operates only a few scheduled flights, with the bulk of its flight-hours spent operating charter services for bureaus and personal business alike. They wear uniforms styled after Vekllei cultural dress, which predates even the old regime and is a strong part of the national identity.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-11-19-stewards/","title":"Air Stewards in Vekllei"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Welcome to the r/Vekllei variety hour, where the tone between posts judders so inconsistently you\u0026rsquo;ll get whiplash of the mind. I was just drawing and thinking today. This is an author post, in case you haven\u0026rsquo;t noticed \u0026ndash; just a shitty blog.\nYou see, even today I\u0026rsquo;m wildly jealous of the success of those slice-of-life artists on reddit and Twitter. I still don\u0026rsquo;t understand the genre entirely, as a phenomenon. It\u0026rsquo;s usually male artists (at least in Japan), drawing distinctly Japanese neighbourhoods and landscapes, and situating a schoolgirl in the midst of it. They\u0026rsquo;re usually pretty amazing scenes. It\u0026rsquo;s almost always a schoolgirl, too \u0026ndash; in modern Tokyo uniform or „Çª„Éº„É©„ÉºÊúç.\nI\u0026rsquo;m still trying to figure it out. It\u0026rsquo;s obviously not sexual objectification, like so much elsewhere in Japanese illustration \u0026ndash; in fact, it\u0026rsquo;s usually nothing more than mundane or wistful scenes featuring some girl. But why is it always a girl? If it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to evoke a nostalgia for a childhood you\u0026rsquo;ve never had, why is it so rarely schoolboys? It\u0026rsquo;s surely to do with cuteness \u0026ndash; \u0026lsquo;cuteness\u0026rsquo; is almost always a female burden, and cute art is good, happy art. I don\u0026rsquo;t have any stats for this, but anecdotally most of the SOL artists I follow are men, and I reckon a large chunk of the audience for it is too. It\u0026rsquo;s boys creating cuteness for boys.\nMaybe it\u0026rsquo;s interesting for me because Vekllei has a lot of similarities to slice-of-life art. I\u0026rsquo;m in the business of peddling nostalgia for places you\u0026rsquo;ve never been, and Tzipora is very much a girl who is very much in uniform a few days a week. It almost reads as satire, in fact \u0026ndash; Tzipora will never stop being a girl, since she is one of thirteen in the world to \u0026lsquo;not age,\u0026rsquo; as per her canon diagnosis. I don\u0026rsquo;t like to think that I\u0026rsquo;m carrying on in that tradition, or that I\u0026rsquo;m infantilising or deliberately cutifying these characters, but does intention matter at all?\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure there\u0026rsquo;s anything wrong with it, anyway. It\u0026rsquo;s just that sometimes I look back through my catalogue, see its female/male ratio, and consider if I\u0026rsquo;m not just buying into the same kawaii currency.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a cute picture of Tzipora I made. I made a wallpaper of it, if you\u0026rsquo;d like it. Let me know what you think about the slice of life art crowd; I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;ve got a decent overlap, aside from the cool bros here only for the hardcore geopolitik deprezzion posts.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-11-18-blue-shoes/","title":"Blue Shoes"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve just pulled a body from an air force jet here that looks like General MacMillan, and we really need to know right now if it\u0026rsquo;s him.‚Äù\nThe partially buried remains of a U.S. Air Force passenger aircraft are the only blemish on the horizon of central Greenland‚Äôs frigid snowscape. It is the site of one of the greatest political scandals in American history. The ancient landscape was violently disturbed in late December of 2068, when a Grumman Atomcat slammed into the ground, killing all 10 people on board.\nThe Common Interest Watchhawk programme allowed a Soviet naval patrol to report the disappearance of a low-flying aircraft without a transponder. The bodies pulled from the wreckage some hours later would set in motion a panic among Vekllei‚Äôs intelligence agencies and a bloody purge in America‚Äôs south.\nVekllei military intelligence units, who arrived at the site not long after the search began, battled irradiation from the aircraft‚Äôs reactor and freezing temperatures to confirm the origins of the mystery aircraft.\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs him, all right. This is bad news.‚Äù\nAn intelligence servant of the Vekllei Intelligence Americas Bureau (AB/NI) examined the brutalised face of the general. After a moment of consideration, perhaps to reassure himself of the identity of the cadaver, he ordered a suppression order over the site, which would enforce radio silence and conceal the disaster from the political organs of the Vekllei state for up to six hours.\nMacMillan had been distinguished in the U.S.A.F., but would have been an unremarkable soldier in history if it were not for the separatist movements of the Southern states in the late 21st century. The Marshal became Commander-in-Chief overnight, and quickly positioned himself as a lynchpin of negotiation between the separatist and federal governments. As a reasonable military man, he was trusted by the Federal committee, and was at the time of his demise negotiating the lend-lease of strategic nuclear sites that had been seized under the de facto splintering of the United States.\nUnder the lease, the United States Armed Forces would retain control of sites essential for ‚ÄòAmerican continental security,‚Äô but would withdraw sanctions against the separatist states first imposed under the Dallas Accords. So what the fuck was MacMillan doing mangled on a Greenland ice slope?\nAmong the dead was his mistress Olivia Scott-Madison and his two children, Daniel and Sofia MacMillan. His children were in nightclothes. Fighter jets were buzzing the Atlantic. It was clear something had gone terribly wrong in the hours prior.\nThe outside world would never learn the details of the MacMillan Incident, or its causes. What would follow, however, was the purge of many longtime associates of MacMillan from the military hierarchy of the Dallas Coalition states, and the immediate denunciation of the General and his political associates. AB/NI had long chased whispers of a coup against Dallas leadership in the months prior, and it appeared the perpetrator had arrived spectacularly closer to Vekllei‚Äôs gaze than anticipated. The bodies of the General, his family and his aides were flown to Vekllei, where they were identified and placed into archives. Both prime ministers of the country were informed, but were told that Vekllei would not need to worry about attempted American reclamation of the crash site or its occupants. Sure enough, neither the aircraft nor the bodies of its passengers were formally requested by the U.S. or the Dallas states.\nThe findings of an investigation into the crash were inconclusive and quickly shelved. The aircraft was flying low, perhaps to avoid radar detection, so it was possible the pilots misjudged their altitude in the poor weather. Perhaps there had been an incident on board. There were no technical faults determined in the remains of the aircraft, which remains on that slope to this day.\nWhat was known to the wider world was that the proceeding months would spark the bloodiest period of the ongoing American crisis, and the collapse of diplomatic relations between the separatist and federal governments. MacMillan and his family were the first of the vanguard separatists to die, but they were far from the last.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-11-16-coup/","title":"Ten corpses in the snow"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  I had the wonderful opportunity to work with one of our resident worldbuilders on reddit, u/EpicJM, and spend a while with their world and characters.

It‚Äôs not made difficult for any discernible political reason, either ‚Äî relations with the U.S. are as good as they could be for a country like Vekllei. Nonetheless, tourism is regarded as a risk rather than an opportunity, and most Americans who visit for pleasure are wealthy enough to put up the sums of cash required to enter on the national carriers that exclusively operate in Vekllei‚Äôs airspace.\nStepping out into the country for the first time is a hell of an experience. As an American you don‚Äôt really have a framework for understanding these people. They‚Äôre not European, or really Scandinavian. They don‚Äôt share many cultural or political bonds with the continental powers. And they‚Äôre not as easy to politicise or orientalise in the same way the folk of the USSR or Asia can be.

It is common to see children as young as twelve working as guides in the city‚Äôs largest jetport, Vekllei International, since work is basically a form of play. The dependence on Vekllei people for help (since a foreigner can only navigate society with the assistance of those that speak the language and understand the economy) essentially infantilises dignified, wealthy tourists otherwise not used to being looked down upon. This is further exaggerated by Vekllei‚Äôs complete absence of honourifics, lack of professional culture and suspicion of foreigners, meaning that even tourist infrastructure in the country regards Americans as a curiosity to be investigated and gawked at.\nThese barriers to entry only further isolate the country from the outside world, in a position that is (in the late 2070s) totally unique. They are not quite \u0026lsquo;white\u0026rsquo;, not quite \u0026lsquo;religious\u0026rsquo;, not quite \u0026lsquo;Western\u0026rsquo; and not quite \u0026lsquo;communist\u0026rsquo;. Their iconography is nonsense; their language is spoken only by themselves, and their political motivations are as complex and built on intuition as they are incomprehensible to outsiders. Hence the scene above, where the new assistant to the ambassador and his wife are thumbed out of the terminal by a thirteen-year-old girl who speaks broken English.\n The young worker pictured here carries only a radio for communicating with her colleagues and a pouch to fill with personal items, jelly beans or whatever takes her fancy. They work in shifts of usually a few hours each, which are coordinated with the larger nuclear monowing jets that land from the Americas around noon.\n ","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-11-07-tourist/","title":"A Jetport Guide shuffles Americans onto the airport maglevs"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Let\u0026rsquo;s wind down Study Month with a look into the Vekllei curriculum. A few days ago I wrote about how Vekllei schools operate on fundamentally different assumptions about what it means to be ‚Äòa child‚Äô. Let‚Äôs take a look at how that pans out in practice.\nMost students study about 3-5 days a week, depending on the taste of the student and the work timetable of their parents. These days might occur sequentially or be scattered throughout the week, but most common is a Monday-Wednesday table table of four hours a day.\nTzipora, whose previous schooling was in a Catholic school in California, struggled to make sense of her timetable at first. The Vekllei curriculum very quickly depreciates courses outside of the interest of the student, and so staples of modern Western education ‚Äî science, history, mathematics, language, were jumbled and in some cases dropped altogether.\nLet‚Äôs break down her timetable, illustrated partially in English for your convenience.\n Mathematics. Zelda struggles with even basic maths, and so she retains a course for her own wellbeing. Mandatory curriculum maths in Vekllei is mostly pragmatic and straightforward, and teaches theory as well as the basics of calculation and operations. More abstract maths like algebra and calculus are generally only taught in advanced classes designed to facilitate interest in those who show promise in it. Zelda is not one of them. Language. Zelda is an immigrant and at this point in her life speaks only primitive, conversational Vekllei. Because of this, she has three hours of class time a week but attends a special class for tutoring after school each day. She also makes use of her own time to study Vekllei logographs, called Topet. Baron is a good help because she can practice conversationally with him without the shame of mangling language in the real world. Ideology. Zelda for the first time in her life is beginning to engage with the world as a global network, and is quickly learning geography and flags to illustrate it in her mind. The Ideology class is concerned with worldview and how social structures influence it. It looks at traditional political ideologies as well as unconscious assumptions, and how those things affect policy and geopolitics. Chemistry. Zelda likes chemistry and has good grades in it, and so she‚Äôs testing her ability in that area. Although she‚Äôs clearly developed an aptitude for the arts and language, she‚Äôs young enough to doubt her place and still enjoys experimenting with disciplines outside her expertise. Sewing. Zelda likes sewing, and it helps her feel useful since she‚Äôs largely dependent on others for most other parts of her life. This class teaches young Vekllei people practical skills for maintaining clothes in the household. Next year, she plans to take on a more rigorous maintenance course to varnish wood and caulk windows, since it takes forever to get a contractor up to their apartment. Illustration. Zelda does not have enough of an ego to be intimidated by the skills of those around her, so she enjoys the class as a therapeutic outlet for her boundless creative impulses. She is trying to learn to draw portraits so she can do one of Baron for Christmas. Club time. Zelda belongs to the news club of Lola 7th School, and works on weekends as a photographer for the weekly newsletter. Her colleagues are polite and ambitious, and they appreciate her desire to learn. On school time she mostly meets with other members to help print the newsletter by hand on the old jobber press, and develop her photos in the school‚Äôs dark lab. Society. Zelda learns Vekllei history and values in this class, which helps explain everything from the intricacies of the Bureau System and Sundress Municipalism to more intimate notions of the proper way to wear a quarter-pleat and semoisnesne (sun-facing attitude). It also helps contrast Vekllei‚Äôs system against the rest of the world, and more explicitly outlines Vekllei‚Äôs place in it.  Although Tzipora would have many troubles with school, none of them were ever related to her enthusiasm for her classes. Since she picked the ones that benefited her and had plenty of time off to explore the skills learned in them, she developed a healthy curiosity for her talents and it was reflected well in her grades. But, as most Vekllei students will tell you, they learn just as much growing up outside of school as they do inside the classroom. She would not have it any other way.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-11-06-timetable/","title":"A Vekllei Timetable"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Each year, a race is held amongst the most remarkable geological monuments of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s interior. Steep mountains forged in the restlessness of the European and American tectonic plates become deadly checkpoints in the world\u0026rsquo;s most high-stakes aeroplane race in the Western Hemisphere.\nLow-speed, high-maneuverability jets (manufactured by the likes of General Reactor, V.K. Heavy Industries, and Kaleidoscope Aerospace) roar through narrow valleys in time trials that last only a few minutes.

They are constructed first and foremost around high-velocity crashes.\nAlthough a high-risk sport where fatalities are common, it remains popular in Europe and Vekllei. In the latter, the races are organised and subsidised by air racing orgs, usually clubs or pilot associations, and enthusiasts hike the otherworldly slopes of the valleys to watch racing jets compete for glory.

This post comes as we wind down Study Month in r/vekllei. Strap in kids, because this one gets kind of heavy.\n When you get into the idea of it, ‚ÄúThe Child‚Äù is a particularly unfortunate projection. It‚Äôs not something most would agree with, but that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs worked out in the late 2070s. In fact, critical foundations of how foreigners view the world are not culturally neutral subjects as they might assume, timeless and naturally occurring, but are in fact symptoms of ideology. And despite the fact that there are children everywhere, The Child as an independent category of human being is a recent invention, informed by modernism.\nIf you visit Vekllei, and pay enough attention to the ordinary routines of the common Vekllei person, you too might be struck by the absence of The Child.\nThis is the Montre-Lola-Yuman School, but is usually recalled as its district number: Montre 6th. Although modestly pretty, situated in a misty valley and constructed in the postwar demonewda style (a literal portmanteau of education, or demolan, and Vekllei modernism, or newda), it is the site of a remarkable clash between old and new.\nPeople live simpler lives here. Smaller lives, too, focused on pleasure and its pursuit. They have less to hide, and so less to hide from their own children. Here, a kid discovers a great deal about the basic premises of life and navigating relationships from watching their parents go about their work and conversations, and learn largely through play and interaction. Older siblings take on adult, independent roles within the family whilst the United States and Europe further complexify The Child into atomised subcategories; teen-agers, pre-teens, toddlers, and so on. In Vekllei, media and products designed for The Child are uncommon, as are clothes designed for Children, and so growth is informed through exploration and observation, rather than their age and year of schooling.\nThe changes are small but shift mountains culturally. It is not simply that children are ‚Äúsmall adults,‚Äù or that they are ignored or not given affection, but that the grotesque commodification of childhood has been abolished with commodity itself. The very nature of childhood, then, is different from how foreigners understand The Child. In Vekllei, children mix freely between age groups, and do not subconsciously recognise stages of development in a matter of years. They attend the same school for the entire length of their mandatory schooling. Uniforms are universal and carry all the way through university. By their early teen-age years, the young Vekllei person is ready to carry out their place in paradise. This affords the youth of Vekllei dignity and responsibility, and forces a reconsideration of identity outside of the generic expectation of that age group.\nNow, modernism does not necessarily mean commoditisation ‚Äî but they\u0026rsquo;re almost always found sleeping in the same bed. There is no scandal here. From the supermarkets of Utah to the villages of Uraguay, modern ideas of The Child and Interiority have warped the human brain unconsciously, rendering the whole world a meaningless scaffold of incestuous constructions ‚Äî with a cultural history buried in copies of copies of copies. The way we understand landscape, the Self, our children, are all missing or altered in Vekllei, a modernist society without modernism. The rest of the world has been this way for centuries ‚Äî and, most devastatingly, as soon as these constructions were \u0026lsquo;discovered,\u0026rsquo; their origins as constructions were suppressed. It seems to have always been this way, even though it was an invention that coincided more or less with the steam engine. The Child is no more inherent to ‚Äúnature‚Äù (itself a construction) than a railway locomotive.\nThus, over the course of several centuries in the Western world, the child was discovered. Once it was found, an epistemological constellation had to be erected around it to make use of it. To write a story or paint a picture, The Child is projected. A child of America today will now wear clothes for children, play with toys for children and consume media built for that age group. You can expect a child to go through distinct phases, quantified numerically through their years of modern schooling. This carries on to poison the entire lens of childhood, and indeed, the subsumption of the outside world into this sort of culture and commodity is shocking to the Vekllei tourist.\nThis unusual fact makes Vekllei unique in the ideological landscape today, at once a pioneer of the arts and industry and a pre-industrial village, free from the ideological misery of modern life. The abolishment of industry, and the rising up of all people, has rendered the Vekllei people not classless, but a single enourmous class ‚Äî an intellectual, educated class. What truly makes them unique, however, is how the ‚Äúold ways‚Äù and ‚Äúrural priority‚Äù are alive and well in the cities and apartments of the modern Vekllei person. That is utopia in Vekllei today, and that is what it means to grow up there.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-11-01-schools/","title":"Schools in a Society Without Children"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here   Let‚Äôs talk about childhood and utopia. This post comes as we wind down Study Month in r/vekllei. Strap in kids, because this one gets kind of heavy.\n  Tzipora and Cobian, pictured here, have very different stories but both have felt something was not quite right about them. That difference, so it would turn out, would blossom into a preference for women as partners, in the unusual desexualised way Vekllei goes about homosexuality in the late 2070s. To Cobian, who grew up in Vekllei, the realisation was fairly straightforward, although not without moments of anxiety and doubt. To Tzipora, who grew up in the United States, she found herself in crisis. She had previously held deep reservations about so-called ‚Äòbolshevik lesbianism,‚Äô only to discover a contradictory, immutable fact about herself. The canyon between their understandings of how relationships work reveals just how unique Vekllei is in the world today.\n One of many pains of Vekllei‚Äôs growing material wealth was the economic unchaining of women from their husbands, and a shift towards solitude and independence for both men and women. For many, especially in the anxiety of the First Atomic War, lust became work, and marriages and birthrates fell quickly. As the poverty of post-war life developed into fledgling community-focused industry, so too did so-called ‚Äúeconomic feminisation‚Äù (the abolishment of the male burden through the bureau system and work as pleasure) bring about changes in how women understood themselves in a society without commodity.\nThese economic facts coincided with serious cultural seizures of anger and confusion at the collapse of old values and the bloodline-focused family, which culminated in a period of great population stagnation and cultural unrest without anything to fill the vacuum.\nIn a move rare for Vekllei‚Äôs growing council-style democracy called Sundress Municipalism, a cultural movement was enacted at a national level. It was called something along the lines of a ‚Äòsun-facing‚Äô attitude, or semoisnesne, in which free love, relationship pragmatism and most of all, familial independence were encouraged to foster baby-making and marriage happiness. Realistically, this cultural ambition was reinforced with several hundred social programmes designed to mitigate domestic violence, marriage breakdown and divorce. The restructuring of the post-war legal system, in conjunction with semoisnesne, had the unintended side-effect of decriminalising homosexuality, making Vekllei one of the few countries in the world to have done so. Normalisation was not a smooth experience, and social problems linger to this day, but is nonetheless utterly unique in the cultural landscape of the modern Western world.\nSemoisnesne, like most cultural phenomena, has seen a downturn in popularity in the most recent generation of teen-agers and young adults, as part of a wider trend of emotional and sexual reticence in part as a reaction to the ostentatious displays of sexuality of the decades prior.\nUndoubtedly, semoisnesne has made Vekllei a better country. It is now much easier to announce your preference for love in your own gender than it was previously, and that brings with it a whole shift in worldview ‚Äî most crucially of normalisation, where such things are tolerated and visible in everyday society. Like many ambitious progressive projects, it has become a cultural pariah in recent years (teens today sarcastically refer to their attitude as lumoisnesne, which better translates to good-facing [in the sense of a moral or ethical good]), but its marked impact on emotional intelligence and feminisation of the country has undeniably set Vekllei apart in a time dominated by fear and cultural retreat.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-10-25-love/","title":"Emotional Intelligence in the Epoch of Rest"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  This is a follow-up to this post, as part of Vekllei‚Äôs ‚ÄúStudy Week,‚Äù where we‚Äôre touring education and youth in the utopia of Vekllei.\nCompared to their girls, who are adorned with many layers of clothing and dazzling patterns, the schoolboys of Vekllei are unadorned.

In celebration of the approach of exams (at least in the Southern Hemisphere), we turn our gaze north to Vekllei to celebrate Study Week. Every other day we‚Äôll be looking at education in Vekllei, and today we‚Äôre looking at uniforms.\nLife in Vekllei is filled with uniforms for work and in study, for a various historical and cultural reasons. In the late 21st century, in a society where work is social, they help distinguish and professionalise employment, which grants important psychological and social benefits. Where a uniform might be employed for economic reasons in a country of poverty, or as a form of social control in schools, in Vekllei they are identifiers and champions of labour in a workplace or school.\nFor the students of Vekllei, a single uniform is distributed across all ages of schooling, from preschool right through university and miscellaneous higher education. For girls, it is highly modular and incorporates important cultural items of clothing, like the gi quarter-pleat, temple and fountain hairpieces, and overskirt lace aprons called sun petticoats (in ceremony). Although Vekllei was once cold year-round, today it sees warm summers and mild winters that encourage distinct summer and winter fashions. A girl‚Äôs preference in uniforms may cycle through many styles over her schooling years, from spartan minimalism in high school (of just an armband, white shirt and red skirt) to decadent ceremony in her university years.\nIn Vekllei Semaphore, the language of colour and shape, red and white imply both youth and energy (as well as sweetness, determinedness and purity depending on the context), and are often recognised as the national colours. In youth, it distinguishes education from traditional labour (in the literal, physical sense), which is communicated with navy blue.\nHigh-quality uniforms are a marker of national pride, as indicators of national wealth after the shameful poverty of the First Atomic War‚Äôs fallout. To the people of Vekllei, an intricate and expensive uniform distributed amongst ordinary people greatly influences the national ego, and further contributes to Vekllei‚Äôs social and cultural isolation from the rest of the Western Hemisphere.\nTomorrow, we‚Äôll be seeing how the boys compare. Then things will get a little more exciting.

Both class and work had been abolished. Tattoos were almost never seen in the prism of ordinary Vekllei life, but in less savoury occupations they were found where utopian concessions collide with violence and memory.\nBaron rolled up his sleeves and laid them out for her. You could accuse him of many things ‚Äî he was a reticent bloke ‚Äî but he was never dishonest with Tzipora. She was as much a companion as a daughter, and he treated her with the respect he‚Äôd afford any close colleague or friend. His upper arm was marked with faded illustrations from a previous chapter of life. Most obvious was a dragon that looked like it had been done professionally, or at least by a comrade who‚Äôd had some experience. It was intricate and artful. The rest were simple words or illustrations, maybe done by the man himself. Holding her tongue about the dragon tattoo, which demanded attention in its colour and scale, she asked about three dots that matched the patterns of her shirt.\n‚ÄúThose are for Amelie. I mentioned her, didn‚Äôt I? She was my sister ‚Äî she would have liked you, too. She had a strange sense of humour.‚Äù\nThey marked the grave of his sister who passed as a teen-ager from tuburculosis. It was a common outbreak in the poverty that followed the First Atomic War. She was fifteen ‚Äî the Vekllei lifespan is measured in sets of five. Beneath it was a dagger, or improvised military cross, listing the initials of two friends of his and his years of service. ‚ÄúAll done,‚Äù he told her, ‚Äúwhile black-out drunk.‚Äù\nShe asked about his friends, and where they were, and he told her he didn‚Äôt know. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true. That‚Äôs how service overseas goes sometimes. Look how long it took for me to get back here. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recognise them.‚Äù He paused for a moment, and raised his eyebrows. ‚ÄúMost likely, they‚Äôre dead.‚Äù\nWithin the Chinese dragon, illustrated cleanly with improvised equipment, lay a history of sweltering heat and combat. This one was a soldier‚Äôs tattoo, proud and impossible to ignore. You don‚Äôt give much thought to scarring your skin if you‚Äôre about to die. She did not know how long he was there, or in what capacity, because he did not talk about his time in the army. She just knew he was young ‚Äî maybe a few years older than her.\nShe liked his tattoos. For the thirty years she would know him, he was outwardly a quiet and thoroughly unextraordinary man. He took part in no great pleasures except a glass of wine on Friday evenings and a movie with Zelda on Sunday. Not once did he ever raise his voice at her. He smoked occasionally, and a pipe on weekends. But when he rolled up his sleeves after supper to smoke his pipe, and watch the evening from their eighth-floor balcony, the snake climbing the dagger was visible on his forearm. And behind that dagger, and that snake, there was a filthy room in Ariquemes, and a baby‚Äôs cry, and blood. A sinister revelation settled on the room.\nAs Zelda would once explain, you might go to a friend‚Äôs party or parent-teacher, and all the other dads would see hers and think he looked like a professor or bank teller. She liked to think they gave no regard to him at all ‚Äî he looked like a quiet, pleasant, nothing-person. But if he reaches for his left sleeve and rolls it up, that all changes.

Class is irrelevant in utopia, and the basic ideas of manhood and womanhood are being destroyed in hand with the abolishment of industry. Racial identifiers certainly exist ‚Äî the population is descended almost entirely from Scandinavian settlers (with notably fair hair) and those of mixed Inuit-Scandinavian ancestry, whom carry Caucasian features but have dark, often black, hair. There are also many Vekllei of immigrant heritage, largely from Eastern and Southern Europe after the First Atomic War. It is along these racial lines that bullying occurs in schools and atomised communities form.\nIn Montre, a university city of Northern Vekllei, it is not uncommon for these prejudices to fester.

She\u0026rsquo;s so far constructed Pachinki posts about gem children, palace henchmen, sinister earth magics, the Palace Gods, and teeth regents.\nFrom Tzipora‚Äôs notebook:\n[A Guide to Magic, Chapter 2: The Witch]\nThe witches of Pachinki are an interesting affair ‚Äî many books have been dedicated to their research after discovery, yet so little is known about them. They are almost universally misandrists, which is understandable considering their present illegality and persecution in the subcontinents of Zen and Domos. They serve only themselves and individuals they happen to like, and spend most of their lives exploring the canyon between the chaos of nature‚Äôs fundamental frequencies and the power of human magic.\nThey are rumoured to be able to split their own minds. Using old spells long since lost to ordinary people in Zen, they are able to siphon their mental faculties into a trusted object ‚Äî usually a precious gem, and relegate essential functions of the brain to it. For example, a witch might siphon a tenth of her mental ability into a necklace, which then pushes out whatever consciousness exists within then carries on a witch‚Äôs essential functions ‚Äî respiration, blood circulation and pain are just a few of unconscious functions a witch might do away with.\nWhy would they do such a thing? Well, it is known to all people who have ever attempted magics that powerful spells force great stress on the mind. In fact, the more thorough the subsumption of the mind towards the spell, the better the results. By dispensing with her bodily functions, a witch is able to dedicate almost all of her mental power towards the task at hand, and since a brain operating without vital functions is a very stressed brain indeed, she can become extraordinarily powerful as a result.\nSuch magical efforts make perfect sense for people of power ‚Äî government workers, or traditional sorcerers ‚Äî but witches are far more interested exploration and discovery than they are power and conquest. So again ‚Äî why would they do such a thing?\nOnly recently has a possible answer to this question arisen. It is disarmingly straightforward ‚Äî witches are outcasts, and usually very lonely people. By siphoning enough of their own mind into a creature or pet, they replace the pet with a functioning copy of themselves. They are consequently able to make friends at will.\nSuch a process is incredibly dangerous ‚Äî although only a fraction of brainpower is required to make a functioning consciousness, they are in essence duplicating a human mind. To transplant a consciousness of human intuition into, say, a raven, requires powerful psychophysical drugs and gems of a correct frequency to stop a collapse of the mind (and subsequently render ten percent or so of the witch‚Äôs brain ability permanently nonfunctioning). Even upon a successful schism, her summoned consciousness is hardly a raven ‚Äî it is an anthropomorphic creature, of human mind and animal body.\nAnother fact of the witch, which may interest the reader, is that they do not decompose upon death. They are ordinary people in life, but ancient magic the likes of which is unobservable and unknowable keeps their body, intact or otherwise, totally preserved (though thoroughly dead). In kingdoms where witchcraft is a crime, you can find ‚Äúwitch towers‚Äù filled with the fresh, undead body parts of executed witches that will long outlive the grisly silos themselves‚Ä¶\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-10-06-witches/","title":"The Mountain Witches of Pachinki"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Hello, everyone.

Say, Moise, could you tell Zelda she looks nice when you see her?\u0026rdquo;\nBefore Moise could ask, Zelda\u0026rsquo;s voice rang out from behind her father.\n\u0026ldquo;Tell him I\u0026rsquo;ll be a moment! Just a moment!\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; like most Zeldaic exclamations, there was panic in it.\nA few minutes later, he stepped inside her room to see her. She was dressed as a witch, and wore a cardboard hat fashioned in black linen on her head. Most immediately, however, he noticed she was wearing eye-liner and rouge. He\u0026rsquo;d never seen her wear make-up before, because she looked too young to wear it. She was a teen-ager whose appearance made such feminine gestures a costume rather than daily practice.\n\u0026ldquo;You look really nice,\u0026rdquo; Moise said. \u0026ldquo;Have you done yer face?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; she beamed, \u0026ldquo;you noticed! It\u0026rsquo;s not done poorly is it? I\u0026rsquo;ve got no practice.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Nah, it looks great.\u0026rdquo;\nHe wasn\u0026rsquo;t lying. She\u0026rsquo;d gone a bit heavy since her lashes were so dark already, but she looked years older for it. Zelda wilted under any timid flattery and smiled genuinely at him.\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe I should wear it sometimes. It\u0026rsquo;s not too much trouble.\u0026rdquo;\nBaron called from the living room: \u0026ldquo;It took two hours.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;All right!\u0026rdquo; she yelled, and after a moments of pause, followed with a kinder shout. \u0026ldquo;Thanks for helping me.\u0026rdquo;\nThe festival went until the early hours of the morning. Cold city air washed over them in waves as they passed through warm clouds of woodsmoke from fires set out for hallow\u0026rsquo;s eve. He was dressed in pinstripes as a Mafia don. He told her he had Mafia blood in him. Zelda asked if he was getting Greece confused with Italy, to which he took great offence. She started laughing as his fake moustache danced about on his upper lip when he corrected her, which made him more annoyed.\nIt was a nice night out, in the end.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-10-05-mafioso/","title":"A Mafioso and His Witch"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Welcome again to MoonMonth! It started a week ago and will go until I‚Äôve said all I can say. We‚Äôre looking at how Vekllei conquered the moon today.\nVekllei unequivocally won the space race. Not because it had the first man in space ‚Äî the Soviets succeeded in that. Nor were they the first to the moon ‚Äî the Americans had been there for nearly a century. But Vekllei was the first to establish permanent habitation of the Moon‚Äôs southern pole, and its claims of territory were reluctantly accepted in the early 2070s after nearly a decade of heated diplomacy. Although the value of the Southern Pole had been known for some time, it was Vekllei that leapfrogged the world‚Äôs largest powers to secure the moon‚Äôs most valuable real estate.\nFrom Vekllei‚Äôs Mt Io, which the rest of the world knows as the Malapert Massif, Vekllei‚Äôs largest city enjoys more sunlight year-round than the arctic home country, and parts of the Copette Basin (Shackleton Basin in English) have peaks of eternal light. It enjoys uninterrupted microwave visibility to the Earth. A thick smooth regolith has supported a permanent, concrete settlement and landing areas. It also sits adjacent to regions of permanent shade, which are home to valuable gasses and water which supply Vekllei‚Äôs spacecraft with fuel, and assist in fusion research.\nThe Vekllei Moon Zone has expanded several times in the thirty years of its existence. At first it claimed only a few hundred square kilometres around Mt Io, but has since come to dominate much of the territory around the moon‚Äôs Southern Pole.\nToday, it is a thriving colony of invaluable economic and psychological importance to the city-state back home. It includes Moidonnet, a city of 50,000 people with all the luxuries of home ‚Äî plus a few more, like biome domes and zero-gravity museums. Traismodonnet is a military city in the Aitkin Basin that houses much of Vekllei‚Äôs classified research into fusion technology. An enormous cosmodrome sits in the Huay Crater (named after Vekllei‚Äôs largest cosmodrome on Earth), supported by a military landing site a few hundred kilometres away in the Schr√∂dinger Crater. Prohibited zones litter the Vekllei Moon Zone, including areas allocated for hydrogen and water extraction (such as the SPA Basin Mining Zone, the largest of its kind on the moon) and the Aero Prohibited Area, which extraterrestrial landing craft and weapons in view of the disputed territories.\nValuable real estate is scarce on the moon, especially when costs for travel and infrastructure remain so high. The moon is rife with claims and counter-claims, which often escalate into border skirmishes. These claims sit alongside vast unclaimed territories, largely on the far side of the moon. Any claim made on this vast Terra Nullius will trigger a reaction of counter-claims, and escalate a declining world further into conflict.\nThat is the moon today. A place of military espionage and tremendous scientific advancement, largely distributed between a handful of superpowers and Vekllei‚Äôs jewel in orbit.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-09-28-moon/","title":"The State of the Moon in 2078"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  MoonMonth will return tomorrow. As an interlude\u0026hellip;\n In Winter 2064, the changes made to the constitution of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) would be felt around the scouting world. By this point it was pretty clear that the globe had entered a ‚Äúhelter skelter‚Äù decline towards tragedy. The emerging fission technologies were too slow and expensive to mass produce, and the fossil fuels that lighted homes around the world were starting to run dry.\nIt wasn‚Äôt just a crisis of resources ‚Äî there had been Taiwan, and the Commonwealth Wars, and the disaster of decolonisation. There was a long history of decline, paved in blood, and it was pretty clear that things were going to get worse before they got better. If they got better at all.\nIn Winter 2064, several clauses were introduced into BSA recruitment that would reposition the organisation as a fundamentally patriotic youth org, and would seek to raise a generation of the kinds of boys and girls America would need in the coming decades. They would have to be resourceful, capable and most of all, dutiful adults.\nChinese-born children were thereafter denied entry altogether, and those of immigrant heritage would be subject to allegiance testing. Over the course of a week and several indiscreet searches of the family political history, the BSA recruitment board would weed out communists and suspected agitators.\nFor an organisation of the prestige and heritage of the BSA to implement overt racial vetting meant that political repression was normalised ‚Äî so-called ‚Äúnational orthodoxy‚Äù ‚Äî in youth orgs around the world.\nIn Vekllei the largest youth organisations include\n The National Blossoms The Puffin Scouts The Landscape Bureau  The National Blossoms concern themselves largely with traditional landcare and stewardship of national parks, and the Puffin Scouts are focussed on camping and friendship. The Landscape Bureau includes people of all ages, not just youth, and form part of Vekllei‚Äôs Parks and Heritage organisation (in which careers can be forged).\nAlthough the constitutional reforms of the BSA, and subsequent militarisation of many European scouting organisations (as well as several so-called Western pockets of Asia), had little obvious effect on Vekllei‚Äôs youth orgs, subtle changes were made to better distinguish her domestic scouts from the rise of child fascism across the world. Parts of the uniform were demilitarised, and girls were allowed to wear skirts for the first time. The colours of the Puffin Scouts shifted from red and white, which is associated with the country as an identity, to gold and green, which better translate to ‚Äúwilderness‚Äù in Vekllei Semaphore. The political curriculum of the youth orgs (covering Upen, the Bureau System and the modern Vekllei city-state) was shifted to eighteen and above.\nIt‚Äôs a scary time to be alive, but the children of Vekllei‚Äôs youth orgs are largely unaware of it outside of nuclear drills. Young scouts ‚Äî ranked as Pufflings in the Puffin Scouts ‚Äî spend their childhood years learning to tie knots and make friends, where the children of America are learning to shoot a rifle and memorise the dual constitutions; that of the Boy Scouts, and that of America.\n In the picture above, you\u0026rsquo;ll notice a guide to decoding a simple Vekllei Gi, a type of ceremonial quarter-pleat, and a collection of items a Puffin Scout is likely to have on their person.\n ","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-09-27-puffins/","title":"Puffin Scouts"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Thank you very much everyone.

Those rockets are packed with robotic mining equipment and are sent chasing asteroids floating through our solar system. The robots return sometime in the following year with an asteroid rich with metals in tow, where they are incinerated upon entry and many tonnes of metals are plunged into empty drop zones in the Atlantic.\nFor Vekllei, a resource-poor island country with an insatiable demand for steel and uranium, extraterrestrial mining has allowed the country to fund projects of great national pride. These include the moon tourism programme, the Faroe military bases, and large atomic airships for work and pleasure.\nThe Copette Basin is a mountainous region far enough from Copette proper to launch rockets regularly. The flower-tundras that frame them are caught at once between the incomprehensibly ancient tectonic landscape and these visions of tomorrow.

These posts are going to work a little differently ‚Äî we‚Äôre going to follow Tzipora through her adventures in Moon City and beyond, and learn about the moon in this world along the way. Strap in!\n Vekllei has put a great deal of effort into developing infrastructure for tourism across the lunar surface of the Vekllei Moon Zone. For no cost except their labour in society, a Vekllei person is able to enjoy a handful of activities in Moidonnet (‚ÄúMoon City‚Äù), the largest and most recreational of the moon colonies. It is a complex of about a hundred connected buildings at the base of Mt Io, far away from the border territories of the Vekllei Moon Zone. On her 18th birthday, for which she still looked fourteen, Tzipora was gifted a week-long holiday in Moidonnet with her father, Baron, who surprised her with tickets.\nTzipora had never got to grips with flying. She was uneasy around most things too big for her immediate comprehension. The sky and the sea and space might be grand, but she was a small girl of a provincial disposition and was satisfied with a pocket of land and some people to talk to. She had taken pills for the flight to the moon, which climbed steeply and enjoyed several hours of zero gravity, but had calmed down by the time she‚Äôd acclimatised to the novelty of life in Moidonnet.\nShe was now in a room fretting over the equipment that would separate her person from millions of miles of empty vacuum. Around her was a pink preparation room with padded walls, typical of the confined spaces of Moon City. In this gravity it only took a stumble to send you careening into the air, and the cushioning would prevent you from cracking your head open. Along the walls were metal railings available to seize in the event you lose your balance.\nThe City was distinctive in its shoelessness, as it was easy to float in the low gravity of the moon and kick things that should not be kicked. It made the whole place feel quite scientific and homely at the same time ‚Äî like all tourists here were fellow travellers in some great expedition, too familial to bother with formalities like shoes.\nA heavy atmospheric suit was suspended by its lifelines to the roof. It was bulky and had strange shiny booties at the feet. Nearby were moon boots, which would be sealed along with the rest of the suit in a vacuum cocoon before test depressurisation in the airlock. The International Standard flag was hung on the wall, probably to impress foreign tourists. There were a handful of foreign tourists visiting, usually relatives of Vekllei citizens. Occasionally you saw obviously wealthy foreigners who‚Äôd payed their own way. They were easy to spot, for their gold rings and nice clothes looked absurd and tacky in the face of the glory of Vekllei infrastructure.\nThere was no appetite for skirts in Moon City. The risks were too great. She‚Äôd changed out of trousers into a stiff jumpsuit bleached white with cleaning chemicals. Now that the domestic conventions of getting changed had been completed successfully, the weight of her adventure finally dawned on her. She took a seat and looked between the helmet and the body of the atmospheric suit, and felt her stomach drop. All of a sudden she missed Baron very dearly. Where had he got to?\n Next time, we‚Äôll look at rockets.

From Ground Control on Earth in the district of Huay, Vekllei operates many moonbases, domes, research facilities and tourist opportunities in the moon‚Äôs southern hemisphere within a large complex called Moidonnet ‚Äî Moon City. It sits a hundred kilometres south of Mt Io (called Malapert Mountain in the West) in the Vekllei Moon Zone. It receives shuttles several times throughout the day.\nThe first time Zelda visited the moon was as a birthday gift from her father, who hadn‚Äôt been in many years. She recalls reading extensively about the moon in preparation for the trip.\n ‚Äú‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs hoping, then. So we‚Äôve booked for three nights up in Moidonnet, and then a single night in Traismadonnet, a smaller city closer to the equator. I wanted us to do as many things as possible, so I think we should visit the peak of Io Mountain today, where they say they have a spectacular bio-dome and you can see forever, and maybe go on a space-walk. We‚Äôll see. Spacewalks are hard to book ahead for, but if we get tired we can just do everything else the next day.\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs also an art gallery built for low gravity.

The country had made tremendous progress in recovery from the First Atomic War, and set to work nearly a decade in advance of the Expo to create a palatial fairgrounds between the districts of the Capital and Ro.\nThe centrepiece of which was a triumph of Newda design and Vekllei civic construction: the Number 7 Plant, or Peace Reactor, which was the first commissioned molten-salt fission reactor of its type in the country to produce power. The main reactor structure is located within a pure unblemished sphere above a grand public hall and museum detailing Vekllei‚Äôs long history with nuclear power.\nAlthough it does not produce as much power as the country‚Äôs larger plants at 1,020 megawatts, and is frequently shut down for experiments, it is uniquely situated upon a hill in the centre of the city and is visible from almost all parts of the capital area.

A serious fear of flying and the open ocean has hedged her appetite for travel for all of her thirty-two years. She is well respected as an operations consultant within the Americas Bureau at National Intelligence (AB/NI), and is close with the ABNI Operations Director Baron Desmoisnes and Vekllei‚Äôs first ‚ÄúGregori Baby,‚Äù Tzipora \u0026ldquo;Zelda\u0026rdquo; Desmoisnes.\nShe‚Äôs known Baron, Tzipora‚Äôs father, for nigh twenty years. They met when she was eighteen, both as cadets in Vekllei‚Äôs combat intelligence programme. They dated for a few years before the requirements of intelligence work forced them apart. Baron was sent to South America for nearly a decade, and Ayn stayed behind in the Monitoring \u0026amp; Preparations Department where she published work in the classified journals about events relevant to ABNI. She was also an associate contributor to the ‚ÄúImport Strangle‚Äù theoretical model, which has proven successful at plotting the collapse of major U.S. employers (like U.S. Steel in 2065 and Chrysler in 2068) for use in Vekllei foreign policy.\nBaron and Ayn exemplify quiet, uncinematic mateship ‚Äî people satiated by occasional company and mutual respect, satisfied by their intermittent time together. After Tzipora‚Äôs adoption, Baron, now approaching his forties, returned to work as a senior director for the Americas Bureau, and soon found himself in Ayn‚Äôs professional orbit. In doing so, he introduced a nervous young satellite called Tzipora to her.\nTzipora adores Ayn. Ayn is everything Tzipora wants to be. She is even-tempered but strong-willed, graceful but not girlish, fiercely intelligent but pleasantly social. Where Baron is a product of his years in America and is totally professionalised at home and at work, Ayn has enjoyed life in Vekllei and is well-rounded and sweet. It was a shock for Tzipora to see Baron and Ayn in a photograph from their cadetship. Baron straddled a motorcycle, and did not wear spectacles. He was well-built and rough-looking. Ayn was a slender Asian woman dressed in slacks and a sunhat. Ayn today looked very much similar. Baron, in his beard and white-speckled hair, looked like an entirely different person.\nTzipora and Ayn share a hardship in their infertility despite a desire to have children ‚Äî Ayn suffered from endometriosis for many decades and is incapable of pregnancy. In all ways, Baron‚Äôs reluctant decision to adopt Tzipora was a wonderful blessing ‚Äî it brought old friends closer together and gave Ayn a daughter. For Tzipora, whose memories of her biological mother were bittersweet and muddied with time, Ayn was a breath of womanhood and light-heartedness in a household that contained only a single hard-working middle-aged man and his teen-age daughter.\nSince Baron‚Äôs immediate family is dead, Tzipora is close with Ayn‚Äôs parents in the North of Vekllei and they‚Äôve taken to her as a granddaughter. Although Ayn and Baron are not married, and may never marry (although Tzipora gauges his response at least once a year), their lives are so thoroughly entwined that it is not uncommon that Baron will return home to Ayn and Tzipora preparing dinner together. In fact, Ayn is the reason Tzipora is such a good cook. Love takes many forms, and Tzipora enjoys several of them.\nNormal programming will resume presently.

You can read more about the Vekllei army in these old posts here and here.\nThe Vekllei de ra Couismenan Desnepotet, or the Vekllei Foreign Army, is an exclusively foreign fighting force employed by the National War Bureau. It accepts any person between the ages of 18 and 35. After five years or being wounded, the soldier is granted Vekllei citizenship, making the Foreign Army one of the only guaranteed ways to secure citizenship in the country. Many thousands apply each year, but only a few hundred are chosen to enter training. Out of those hundred, almost all recruits have previous military experience, and many have spent time in conflict zones as mercenaries or special forces.\nA Vekllei soldier is called a ‚ÄúMacker,‚Äù or ‚ÄúMacka,‚Äù which is Vekllei slang for a tool or implement (with origins most likely in the useless colonial wars of a century ago), and the fighters of the Foreign Army share this name. Macker slang is called Mackanese, and serves as a colourful argot that distinguishes military people from the general population.\nThe Foreign Army recruits are given a very different style of training to those at home. Where Vekllei people are egalitarian, laconic, and suspicious of authority, foreign recruits are taught to reverently serve the Army as an institution and maintain their status as elite soldiers. Vekllei has no qualms about allowing women to enlist in its special forces, and they are treated the same as male soldiers. Their numbers remain low among the Foreign Army population, but those that succeed are very skilled soldiers.\nSoldiers of the Foreign Army are stationed abroad, and command areas of Vekllei political or economic interest. Almost eighty percent are stationed in the so-called ‚Äúquadrilateral of poverty,‚Äù which has corners in Hong Kong, Darwin, Johannesburg, and Casablanca. Within this shape you‚Äôll find the interests of the world‚Äôs powers, pushed to the brink following the collapse of oil and an extraordinarily expensive arms race for over a century.\nWhile on a mission, unless food is acquired by other means, mackers eat pills. They carry three kind of pills: vitamin and performance-enhancing supplements (usually amphetamines), water disenfectants, and growables. Growables are capsules that, when mixed with water, solidify into a sort of paste that mackers call \u0026lsquo;remen soup,\u0026rsquo; after the male prime minister of Vekllei (Vekllei has both a male and female head of state). Although they come in several flavours, they invariably have the texture of cold, watery gruel and are never eaten outside of missions.\nIn addition, all fighting folk of the Foreign Army carry \u0026ldquo;fucksticks,\u0026rdquo; a deliberately crude transliteration of \u0026ldquo;fox-sticks\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;explosive fox-hole diggers.‚Äù The firing end of a fuckstick is placed against asphalt, earth, or a wall, and after a short fuse it craters whatever is unfortunate enough to be on that end of it. In a grassy field, it will provide an emergency foxhole in otherwise flat earth. In an urban environment, it will allow entry through walls (and potentially bring the whole structure down). In the desert, it will produce a huge plume of sand that will obscure the soldier.\nMost spectacular of the fighting man\u0026rsquo;s equipment, which otherwise distinguishes today\u0026rsquo;s equipment from that of yesteryear, is the jump-belt. Up to ten propellent canisters feed two jets that enable an ordinary person of mild athletic ability to perform superhuman jumps. They are not jet-packs; indeed, jet-packs are dangerous, specialised equipment rarely used for combat operations. Instead, a tug of a rip-cord will allow an unencumbered soldier to jump several meters, or cross a gap of up to 30 feet. While in development, the jump-belt was imagined to revolutionise infantry combat; it would allow troops to leap into second-story windows or leap across rooftops. Perhaps, it was even theorised, that someday we might do away with parachutes altogether and use belts to land instead. In reality, the jump-belt is mostly used to cross open roads or avenues, or to escape incoming fire. They are enormously unwieldy, and inexperienced troops will almost always lose their balance. In the right hands, however, they have seen success in the battlefield.\nThe National War Bureau is not a naive organisation. Outwardly the Foreign Army are foremost a declaration of power, in the child\u0026rsquo;s masculine fantasy most warlike forces rely so heavily upon; recruits are told that they are beyond good and evil; that they do what needs to be done; that they are a vanguard in the face of the forever war. The iconography and legend of the Foreign Army relies so heavily upon the masculine and the mercenary for the same reasons that the reshaping of a person‚Äôs identity is an essential part of the recruitment process \u0026ndash; to submerge a decent person into the raw language of power, and disguise the iconography of hero-worship from its praxis as a totenkopf. In a global climate where consumption has ravaged the national and spiritual identity outside of Vekllei, and force is normalised and glorified, the foreign army is legitimised and made innocent for their vast crimes across the poverty quadrilateral.\nThey carry on, doing ‚Äúwhat needs to be done‚Äù. It is only once they are broken and emptied by five years of indiscriminate violence, for undeclared reasons in an undeclared war, that they are shipped into Vekllei and find themselves too broken to assimilate into domestic society. So they reenlist; they are the eternal soldiers of a forever-war.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-09-08-war/","title":"The Face of War in the 21st Century"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  In the quaint ocean country of Vekllei, during their years of fecundity and fun, the calendar is divided into twelve festivals of various celebration and purpose. They include the Festival of the Sea in October, which celebrates Vekllei‚Äôs vast fishing navy and concludes with the detonation of a nuclear weapon off Vekllei‚Äôs coast, to the Festival of the Moon in January, which is quiet and acknowledged only through personal ceremony and decorations.\nOne of the most important festivals in the country‚Äôs animistic spiritualism, called Upen, is the Festival of Fasting. It is not a traditional fast ‚Äî you are permitted to eat as much as you like. Instead, the Tesmosnen festival asks participants to either reject meat or hunt it for the duration of the festival.\nAlthough by no means mandatory, during January you‚Äôll begin to notice restaurants alter their menus and youth organisations train to hunt during the festival weeks. There is an important cultural reason that usurps the largely spiritual origins of the festival ‚Äî fasting or killing forces you to acknowledge, as a consumer, the cycles of production and consumption at a most basic level. In Vekllei, which seeks a return to preindustrial lifestyles, modernisation largely abolishes the previously intimate relationship a common person had with agriculture.\nAs a mountainous island country, Vekllei must import the majority of its red meat, and shortages are common in rural areas. Although polls show that Vekllei prefers fish as its meat of choice, it is undeniable that consumption of red meat has increased tenfold over the last few decades.\nDuring the three weeks of the festival, Vekllei people, including older children, are encouraged to fish or hunt as personal recreation or through environmental organisations. The act of killing and cleaning better illustrates the servile relationship the Earth now has with voracious human appetite, and this relationship forms in part the total Upen worldview.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-09-07-festival/","title":"Tesmosnen, the Festival of Fasting"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Hey everyone, I drew this a little while back after getting back from Woomera, South Australia.

It sits atop a platform with the rest of the carefully-vetted news media, watching an anti-ship guided missile roar into life and sail in a graceful ark into the air.\nSince Vekllei is small, and highly populated, a special prohibited air corridor guides the missiles west of Montre and out into the North Vekllei Sea. The arctic seabed is littered with many prototypes of this kind, and is patrolled regularly by navy ships to discover enemy submersibles seeking to engage in deep-sea espionage.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-09-06-machine/","title":"A Most Complex Machine, the Autokinotheodolite"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  For the first six months Baron had known her, Zelda was a serious and wisened young woman who carried symptoms of her troubled past as gracefully as anyone ever could. Poverty ages a person, and she‚Äôd nurtured a calm and dispirited disposition. She did not like war films or books with unhappy endings, or loud noises or arguments. She dressed conservatively and spoke quietly and uncontroversially. She had lived a lifetime already, working in exploitation in motels and supermarkets, watching as Utah unraveled around her. She was an immigrant and uneducated, homeless and independent, and so by the time she arrived in Vekllei she was ready to settle down and live quietly.\nWatching her psyche attempt to reconcile her sombre nature with her desire to be normal and socialise with people her own age was heartbreaking. She had this pathetic, mythical idea of normal girlish life, and it took her a long time to figure out that teen-age life worked differently from films. She had a group of people she hung around, but always on the periphery. She was blatantly disposable and socially innocent, and so she carried on pretending she could somehow rework her own image into the mythologised Coca-Cola teen dream she‚Äôd clung to since California.\nEventually, the idea fell apart. Where she was mousy and pitiful as a school-girl, as Zelda she was uncompromising and principled. As bullying got worse, and her school friends came to resent the parasitic relationship she\u0026rsquo;d worked her way into, things eventually came to a head and the whole thing came crashing down. She got beat up pretty bad, and ruined a new school shirt, but Zelda had fought tougher creatures than Vekllei schoolgirls and she was suspended for the rest of the semester.\nEventually, Zelda would figure out that she never really needed or wanted the sort of bubbly teen-age friends she‚Äôd imagined. Zelda was, after all, not that bubbly or teen-age. Throughout her life, her closest friends were always those that required nothing and gave her space. That was how she liked to be; loved and shown affection, but left to her own devices.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-09-05-fat-lip/","title":"Big Mouth, Fat Lip"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Many dozens of little trains wind their way around mountain peaks in the centre of Vekllei. They stop at upland villages and towns of sometimes only a few dozen people, before consolidating into larger terminuses that connect nearly every village in Vekllei by rail. It is possible, should the timetables align, that you can reach the capital from any part of the country in under 2 hours.\nThis sprawling rail network is ubiquitous with the Vekllei landscape, where images of simple agricultural life coincide with a train or tram. They are among the most beloved services of Vekllei society, from the vehicles themselves to the people that run them. Almost every precious memory and significant occasion of Vekllei life is preceded by a trip on the train.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve posted another painting of Vekllei trains here. I\u0026rsquo;ve also illustrated the uniforms of Vekllei rail staff.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-09-04-railway/","title":"The Mountain Railway"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Editor\u0026rsquo;s note: this article, while ready for reading, is still under construction.\nConsidering both the length and convoluted terminology that embroil this project, there was only so long I could carry on before people started getting lost. The truth of it is that Vekllei is not a particularly complex or difficult project to summarise, despite the snapshot \u0026ldquo;lore in scenes\u0026rdquo; approach that kneecaps a complete understanding. I\u0026rsquo;m just lazy.\nIn fact, Vekllei is not a particularly challenging idea. It is unique, but some days that\u0026rsquo;s about all it has going for it. The word itself ‚Äî Vekllei ‚Äî refers to both the landscape and the people of an island we know as Iceland. This project looks at that country and its people across a span of about fifty years, mostly between 2070 and 2120. As an alt-history, timelines diverge between our world and theirs in the 1940s, although Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s history is much older.\nVekllei is utopia, but Vekllei is not perfect. It is constructed under a framework of utopie concr√®te, where dreamlike landscapes and characters collide with the dirt and dysfunction of reality. To some people, the contradictions and imperfection of Vekllei society would disqualify it as utopia, especially in an orthodox understanding of the idea, but Western cultural orthodoxy is not the metric used by a Vekllei person.\nVekllei people instead use Vekllei cultural metrics, and to a Vekllei person it is the patina of things ‚Äî its imperfections and tragedy ‚Äî that recognise the beauty in life itself, as markers of both existence and usefulness. This cultural intuition is a central tenant of Upen, Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s nondenominational animism and universal spirituality.\nSimultaneously, Vekllei is undeniably heavenly. It is a gorgeous country of spiritual satisfaction and earnest friendship. Your first day in Vekllei is a dizzying spiritual experience. The weight of the world seems to shift, and then rise off your shoulders. Colour and vitality disentangle themselves from injustice and consumption and pivot to meet you. Food is good and free, strangers are friendly and bursting with lively purposefulness.\nVekllei understands itself as a city-state. This colours a lot of how Vekllei people think of themselves. In practice, there are many distinct \u0026lsquo;cities\u0026rsquo; ‚Äî the Capital, Little Vekllei, Copette, Ro, Montre and Adouisneh are the largest of them ‚Äî but they are not recognised as such or federated in Vekllei geographic lexicon. Vekllei is a single continuous neighbourhood, circling nearly the entire coast of their island. Vekllei is also the land on which they sit, which predates the country by millions of years and informs many principles of Upen, which go on to manifest in public policy.\nVekllei cities are almost entirely built according to a single architectural school, Newda, which manifests in many different ways but is almost always obviously a flavour of midcentury modernism. Water and concrete define Vekllei cities.\nThe Vekllei flag is an unornamented purplish red, known as the \u0026lsquo;Domestic Standard\u0026rsquo;. Internationally, they employ a highly decorated flag called the \u0026lsquo;International Standard,\u0026rsquo; which features both the Oa national flower (and omnipresent symbol in every corner of society) and Vekllei logographic script, called Topet.\nVekllei has five language systems, which contribute to the single national language \u0026ndash; also called Vekllei. There is spoken Vekllei, Topet (logographic Vekllei script), Rapotenne (name-script), Vekllei semaphore, and Potenne (hand-talk) or Upotenne (spirit-hand-talk). Potenne is a sign language used with or in place of speech, and Upotenne is a way of manifesting physical runes specifically.\nVekllei cities are very colourful, because colour has great meaning. You can construct sentences using only colour and shapes through Vekllei semaphore.\nThis sort of lifestyle is possible because of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s abolishment of work, commodity and consumption. In the case of Vekllei, this means that people do not use money and work only for personal benefit, as both ways of actualising themselves and keeping useful or socialising. Not all work is equally difficult or interesting, but everyone must work in fairness. For some, that means as little as a few hours a week copy-editing neighbourhood newsletters. For others, they may work weeks without days off. The consequence of this is that value and products are valueless in any real sense, as post-scarcity relegates the functioning Vekllei economy to autonomous overproduction and waste.\nThe question of why people work is not an especially difficult one. In Vekllei, where money has not existed for a long time and generations are raised without it, basic premises of motivation have been reconsidered. Life in Vekllei is mostly a largely individual march towards actualisation, through several avenues of pleasure. There is the enjoyment of food and culture, the intimacy of love and marriage, the heritage in family and blood, and the power of work and professional legacy. Only a handful of these contribute to the pleasure of work, but in a society that has mostly done away with menial work through automation and advanced robotics, pleasure is mostly what you make of it. In Vekllei, this is called Product Socialism, an inaccurate nominer that describes both the bureau system of work and distribution and Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s fundamental syndicalism. In politics, it is called Sundress Municipalism.\nThe quality of life for almost any other person in today\u0026rsquo;s world, however, has declined slowly by nearly any metric. People are, on average, poorer and hungrier than they were fifty years ago. Various contradictions ‚Äî in startling contrast to Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s own schisms ‚Äî have left previously dignified superpowers in disorienting cycles of bloodshed and madness. In the U.S., a large number of confederate states have reasserted their sovereignty following the collapse of the Ford Motor Company and the Northrop corporation. Cultural reforms in Red China have left vast wings of the CCP disatissfied with current leadership, with whispers of a coup. Western Europe has rediscovered her reactionary heritage and indulged in a serious of increasingly authoritarian traditionalist movements, and the export economy of the Soviet Union has collapsed after the shift towards atomic fuels. Vekllei rejects millions of applications for asylum each year.\nThe circumstance of the world is only made more tragic by the relative peace and stability of Vekllei, and the simplicity and carefree lifestyle of the average Vekllei person. Vekllei has the most flowers per capita of any country in the world. The last fifty years has seen the melting of much of the poles and the the introduction of el nino summers and instant winters that wrack Germany, Austria, Italy, and much of temperate Europe. The Adriatic seems to see more gloom than mediterranean sun these days. The equatorial deserts of the world, Nevada included, are mere degrees away from unsurvivable. With temperatures frequently breaking 50C (125F) throughout the year, it thins the population of Southerners too old or too poor to avoid the heat. North Africa is a husk. There is no water and no food. There is a reason there are mass graves all across the shores of the Black Sea, and why Europe tastes the boot. There is a reason the southern African states are crumbling.\nIn Vekllei, with her extreme daylight cycles and polar latitude, the weather has improved significantly. Summers are warm enough to host outdoor activities for much of the season and winters are milder than previously, rarely dropping below freezing. Vekllei life, in its insular fashion, has been somewhat improved by the destabilisation of the climate. Lush temperate rainforests cover much of its lowlying basins, and rich volcanic soils spoil agricultural endevour in the warm seasons.\nVekllei\u0026rsquo;s current prosperity has enabled the country to embark on her final project. The benefits of industrialisation and contemporary post-scarcity are employed in a serious effort to reestablish localised, agrarian life built upon the unit of the community.\nVekllei understands the the achievements of industry as a liberationist tool to return to preindustrial, satisfying life. It is not as though the country will abolish three centuries of tremendous progress ‚Äî quite the contrary, in fact. But understood through petticoat ideology, the marriage of labour and the ordinary person can only occur through self-satisfying, personal work. This is in contrast, one can suppose, to mechanised, industrial labour to which we owe our enormous wealth. To a Vekllei person, work is social, productive, creative and satisfying. The simple pleasures of agriculture; specialised craftsman and tradesman; artistry ‚Äî these are the fruits only of a society that can afford them, since they necessitate the deindustrialisation of agriculture, factory manufacturing and mass media simultaneously.\nSo even though Vekllei is by all measures an industrial society; a land of helijets and plenty; the people of this country see automation as the deindustrialisation of society, at least culturally ‚Äî a return to community employment, decentralised agriculture and tending of the land.\nVekllei is a fundamentally female country. This is what petticoat society means. There are plenty of men in it, and quite distinct social constructs for men and women exist in a way that distinguishes the country from traditional progressive projects, but the feminisation of the economy and politics remains. Vekllei economic gender theory understands masculinity as first and foremost a value to be consumed in industrial society, in a perverse sort of value exchange. Men are first commodified and then broken through work, killed in wars, are suffocated emotionally, and so forth. The very premise of manhood, as the 1950s understands it (which this world is very much immersed in) is not just a biological or social construct, but an economic one. As Vekllei progresses, and erases these identifiers of masculinity, men will become female first in an economic sense (in a process called economic feminisation), and will eventually become females socially also. These are gender constructs that are essentially still prescribed by traditional Vekllei values, but are tied to the deindustrialisation of the country. The perfect Vekllei society is one in which the man dies with the machine.\nAlthough Vekllei is not a traditional egalitarian experiment, and is often a land of absurd contradiction in Western political tradition, Vekllei women enjoy a society built for them. Womanhood in the country is not defined by commodity or appearance, but by ideas the culture associates with womanhood ‚Äî compassion, bravery, intelligence, grace, etc. They are defined not by their relationships or their economic circumstance, but by their friends, political opinions, ability, etc. The decommodification of society has also decommodified womanhood. Vekllei is not simply a good place to be a woman, but is in fact a female country.\nFinally, you might have notices a certain set of recurring characters. The girl with short dark hair is Tzipora Desmoines, the character of utopia in this project. Her adoptive father, Baron, is bearded and wears half-framed spectacles. Her friend, Cobian, wears round spectacles and her hair in a ponytail. Their mutual friend, Moise, is heavy-set and has curly hair. Together, they represent a broad demographic of Vekllei people. Baron is descended from Nordic caucasians; vikings from Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s initial settlement. Tzipora and Cobian are descended from both inuits and Scandinavians, in the population explosion that followed Inuit settlement in the Danish territory. Moise is descended from Greek immigrants in the tide of immigration that followed the immediate postwar era. Although there are Vekllei people of colour, they make up a minority of the population.\nHopefully, this guide has helped to introduce you to the world in which Vekllei is situatated. I\u0026rsquo;m likely to expand in the coming days on this section, so stay tuned.\nIt is a world of nuclear power, gingham and moon colonisation wrapped in the aesthetic of the 50s/60s. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of poverty and suffering in it, but also tremendous hope. Vekllei is utopia.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-09-03-an-introduction/","title":"A Brief Introduction to Vekllei"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Zelda, for all her outward timidity and mousiness, was mostly self-assured. In the same way that a child is self-assured, in which there is no real epistemology of the self as adults know it. Zelda never grew up to become a real teen-ager, after all ‚Äî her body is forever thirteen-and-a-half, despite her mature and maternal disposition ‚Äî and so she had a reckless sort of confidence that never really doubted the premise of her existence.\nShe did have many weaknesses, however, and she was very conscious of them. They were almost too many to count. The biggest of them, aside from her blatant neurodivergences, was her inability to keep weight on. In her first few months in Vekllei, her skinny frame was symptomatic of her malnourishment in the States. Then, as she struggled to stay above thirty kilos, it became a question of eating habits. Finally, the question was asked ‚Äî did she have some sort of problem, here? And if so, was it something to do with Gregori syndrome, the comfortable answer? Or was it something more complex ‚Äî perhaps an eating disorder?\nAside from her small portions, she did not indicate much in common with other girls her age who struggled with image. In fact, much of physical self-loathing was directed at her thinness, which only emphasised her childish lack of figure and breastlessness. The only times Zelda ever cried over a mirror was when she saw her own scrawny frame that a healthy diet should have been able to remedy. Yet even when she pushed herself, and choked down a second serving, it seemed to hardly make a difference. It was a cycle that would haunt her for a long time, until the age when Gregori women must learn to accept their girlishness in place of traditional ideas of beauty.\nWhatever the case may have been, Zelda has never weighed more than forty kilos except in a winter coat, and she can still count her ribs in bath. What has changed ‚Äî in a most wonderful way that alleviates much of her suffering ‚Äî is her ability to love herself, and understand the limitations of her condition. Considering the fact that she has done so much, and despite her childlessness has mothered many boys and girls to adulthood, priorities shift and the importance of beauty fades. She spends more time today being the best Zelda she can be rather than worrying about her image. After all, image is a loser‚Äôs game in the life of a Gregori baby. Happiness is only ever found within.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-09-03-shadow/","title":"Lighter Than Her Shadow"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here   On her days off from her place of work in the village library, Zelda would descend the slope of the village into a great basin of creeks and flower-tundra. In the summer, when it was warm enough to sit in the sun, you could sit at one end of the valley and admire the wind rushing to meet you as it whipped through fields of flowers. For a few moments you could admire yourself for what you were ‚Äî a small being in a landscape as old as the Earth. It put certain things in perspective. Some people needed to go out and look for a place that would finally make everything make sense. But, Zelda thought, sometimes you could reach the corners of the Earth and still stay where you are.\n There is no greater struggle in a Vekllei person‚Äôs life than that with themselves. Work, like recreation and indeed like consumption itself, is social in this country. Most ordinary material whims of a person can be satisfied in a matter of hours, depending on the nearest station‚Äôs timetable. A handful of dreams are also accessible ‚Äî a trip to the moon, for instance, is a matter of writing the Moon Office and waiting to receive tickets.\nWithout money, there is not much by way of commodity. And without commodity, the premises of life and identity have to be interrogated. A cultural intuition that hasn‚Äôt been seen in developed countries since before the industrial revolution has reawakened, and with it come uneasy existential questions.\nWhat are we doing here, on this planet? What am I doing here? How do I come to terms with the fact that everything is either moving away from or moving towards nothingness?\nWhere the pit of material desire sits in other nationalities, the Vekllei person has a great deal of social anxiety. This phenomenon has only become more severe now that recovery from the Great Atomic War is nearly complete and Vekllei‚Äôs security in the world is mostly assured. Life for most people now engages with their immediate surrounds ‚Äî family, community, and love.\nWhile any combinations of these things can actualise a person, and even rehabilitate the directionless, it doesn‚Äôt work out like that for everyone. Family bonds often sever; communities can be transitory; love is elusive. Even with these things, the question of purpose is more pertinent than ever before, as the whole world approaches a reality without human labour. Just what is it that makes life worth living?\nThis explains, in part, why Vekllei people may not be much happier for all their enormous collective wealth. Despite the richness of their culture, optimism for their future and satisfaction with their conditions, none of these things properly emancipate the heart of utopia from its existential question ‚Äî is it possible to automate humanity right out of humans?\nWhen Vekllei people meet that golden horizon, and cross that rubicon, what waits for human intuition on the other side? Will it be endless days of poolsides and dinner parties? Or will it destroy the soul of our animalistic origins ‚Äî leaving us desperate for value as useful people, and our purpose in work? Whatever the case may be, Vekllei is rapidly approaching it.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-09-02-valley/","title":"The Valley of Faith and Sorrow"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  Sorry for breaking my streak everyone, I\u0026rsquo;m on beta software and it totally shit the bed these last couple days.

A special few go on to become war correspondents and foreign investigators, usually after receiving military training in mandatory service.

Zelda only knew him from the tram, where he carried a criminal stigma because of his rumoured gang affiliations. He was a second-generation Vekllei boy of immigrant Greek heritage. There were a few ethnic gangs in his area, and most immigrant boys that didn‚Äôt do well in school quickly found other causes to fight for.\nZelda quickly antagonised the boy by offering him to her own bullies. She would point out his weight and he‚Äôd point out her clumsy Vekllei language skills and apparent lack of intelligence commonly attributed to foreigners, and so the arms race began.\nBullying did not come naturally to either of them, since they were on the receiving end most of the time and were not particularly manipulative. She would tell Moise he stunk, he would say she was skeletal and unattractive, and they‚Äôd seethe about each other that evening. She would make fun of him for eating a chocolate on the tram, and he stole a hairclip and wouldn‚Äôt give it back.\nOne day she was walking behind him after alighting the tram and had set to whacking him with her bookbag, demanding the return of her red pencil. She kept pushing him. In a fit of anger he slammed her against a garage door repeatedly, where her head bounced against the corrugated steel and nearly knocked her out. He left her incapacitated on the pavement, and fled.\nHe buzzed her apartment the following evening after school, seeking to apologise. She weighed her own crimes against his attack, using unique Zelda metrics that gauged physical and emotional violence somewhat improportionately. She accepted his apology.\nThus began the kind of awkward and unconventional friendship that Zelda seemed to attract. With entrepreneurial zeal she rarely displayed, she struck a deal with Moise ‚Äî he would teach her to fight, and she would help him lose weight. He did not have much experience talking to girls, which was both revealing and endearing, but it helped that Zelda was socially maladjusted and not particularly girlish.

His name was Arhen CIII, and where his ancestors had mouths, he had a thousand teeth that sat in messy rows to the back of his throat.\nThree times a day his mouth had to be washed by palace maidens, and excess teeth brushed off. At night, as he slept, the teeth would grow back and occasionally sprout from his cheeks and chin.\nHe was one of the most powerful men in all of Zen, the land of gem deserts and magic, and tales of his brutality echoed among the large cities of the subcontinent. His jaws were mounted in his face like hunting traps, and upon bad news he would order the messenger‚Äôs hand to be placed in his mouth. That would clamp shut, the poor soul would scream, and minced meat would be spat out by the regent.\nFor a man built for consumption, luxury became lust. Like his father and his father‚Äôs father, he quickly became the richest oligarch of the Zo peninsula, acquiring old magic, artefacts, estates and fine foods like a glutton piles supper on a plate. It was not possession that motivated him, but acquisition and consumption, destroying hedonistically objects that might lift a thousand from poverty or heal the sick. The simple biological impulses of a human were so primitive compared to Arhen, who satisfied his genetics with an insatiable lust for growth and purchase. Over and over, the cycle would continue‚Ä¶\nIn some ways, he was on his way to becoming a Palace God, in which the essence of his family dynasty was being rewritten to a higher place of purpose. But where the Palace Gods derive their powers from superstition and traditions, the Arhen bloodline cultivate godhood through industry and commodity subsumption of the orgasm.\nArhen‚Äôs greed, or rather, his purpose, was only satisfied by the acquisition and consumption of one invaluable product ‚Äî himself. He mortgaged his soul into his estate, through the aid of a spirit-banker, and set to work.\nThe maidens recall hearing only snorts and ecstatic screeches from his room for days. It was not uncommon for the regent to snort ‚Äî his airways were severely deformed by his posthumanism ‚Äî but it soon seemed to replace his loud breathing altogether, as though he were talking to himself in pig. This went on for a week.\nFinally, on the eve of the new Zen calendar, his favourite maiden dared enter. She was called Zamen, and being a strong-willed woman, had attracted some level of respect from the otherwise inhuman Ahren.

On one hand, the country is regressing (both politically and culturally) towards deindustrialised, decommodified life. On the other, it is irreversibly equipped with the benefits of automation and robotics, rendering large swathes of the labour-force obsolete. Work is now, for most purposes, a creative organ that facilitates society, culture and technology. This has led to a society not unlike most planned economies, in which employment is both essential and unnecessary, leading to vast wastage and consumption at scales a market would see as horrifically inefficient but in Vekllei is understood as an enormous social benefit. Some people must still work ‚Äî so everyone must work in fairness. In Vekllei, employment is casual and often unrecorded except by the syndicates, as per the foundations of Sundress Municipalism. As long as you are working, studying or otherwise justifying a life in Vekllei (raising your children or training for competitions, perhaps), then you‚Äôll be left alone to do what you like.\nSince everyone must work, there are many archaic jobs in Vekllei, especially for those still figuring out what they want to do with their lives. The supermarket now rules across most of the world, but in Vekllei there are only a handful of chains with few stores, simply because the provincial self-interest of Sundress Municipalism is sympathetic to individual stores populated by a community, rather than chains. The corner grocer is king.\nSince these supermarkets are often built in imitation of the west, and are remarkably un-Vekllei, the largest three chains are illustrated above for your benefit.\nComen Grocer is the only pre-Atomic War supermarket company in Vekllei, and offers mostly special-interest or foreign products. It actually operates under the same retail bureau that runs the Farmer‚Äôs Syndicate, but is independent. It is run by a board of representatives from each store, whom are elected. Roman here has platinum hair and is a good example of an ethnically Scandinavian Vekllei person, who has descendants dating back to the 11th century.\nJoyloaf operates in the Lola district of Vekllei‚Äôs capital, and is a popular day job for artistic young women who otherwise do not have the means or time to socialise with people their own age. It started as a bakery in 2064 but has since grown to stock many different kinds of foods. It is quite fashionable in Lola, and appears in cultural material originating from that district (as seen in several comics and films). Tzipora has dark hair and a round face, but blue eyes and fair skin. She is a descendent of both Inuits and Scandinavians, making her a member of the second-largest ethnic group in Vekllei.\nThe Farmer‚Äôs Syndicate is both a name and a description of Vekllei‚Äôs venrouive food retail arm, which means that it is beholden to the direction of the country and would be the organisation called upon to provide rations in the event of war. It is a collective of agricultural villages and organisations and operates as a distributor of these products directly. It almost exclusively stocks Vekllei products, as well as ‚Äúitems of cultural significance‚Äù that are traditionally eaten in ceremony and ritual, but are otherwise most popular with Vekllei‚Äôs elderly population. The Farmer‚Äôs Syndicate is the largest supermarket chain in Vekllei, but very few of its stores are actually supermarkets ‚Äî many individual grocers senrouive business operate under the Syndicate‚Äôs structure, but often do not brand themselves as such.\nSupermarkets are fundamentally a novelty in Vekllei, which has a vibrant cafe reputation and in which most food prepared at home is grown locally. Food production is a very important part of Vekllei culture and Upen, and the desacralising effect of chains are symptoms of an industrial, globalised society. This is an unattractive proposition to a country rapidly approaching isolationist pre-industry, in which the cycles of production and consumption are both visible and important.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-08-19-supermarket/","title":"Supermarkets in Vekllei"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  i\u0026rsquo;m like that Ben Folds song about escaping your redneck past but instead of redneck it\u0026rsquo;s anime. who stands like this???\nTime-lapse here.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-08-18-puffin/","title":"Puffin Logic"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  A road trip around Vekllei in the summer is an experience that makes life worth living. In some ways, it is a spiritual detox than reinvigorates a person with the intimate, elusive premise of the Vekllei spiritual enlightenment. In others, it is a way of returning to the earth, and understanding the human place in the principles of Upen.\nNo matter your intention, be it holiday or rediscovery, the very best of Vekllei is on display. Liberated of the desacralising effect of routine, the villages and factories you‚Äôll zoom past take on new and extraordinary light. Removed from it, you see better how society works. The complex web of logistics, from roaring trains on adjacent rail lines to squinting at a passing nuclear flying wing through the sun roof, are now aesthetic indications of petticoat society.\nThe All-Atomic Auto Company betrays its name instantly by not offering a single reactor-powered vehicle in its entire catalogue. Indeed, commercial reactors are so heavy that they are only realistically mounted in truck frames, even in Vekllei‚Äôs insensitivity to cost. You simply cannot fit a fission reactor into a small auto. At least, not yet. In fact, in countries where costs are concern, it is feasible that reactor technology as we currently understand it will never be economical in the frame of a small auto.\nThe AAAC is actually an industrial concern of several Vekllei venrouive bureaus negotiating commercial atomics with the future. These include famous companies like General Reactor, which are at the forefront of global reactor technology and compete directly with Raytheon, and Common Battery. Several lesser known, unglamorous companies also contribute to the cooperative concern. Astrotransmissions supply transmissions and Montre-Rayon Foundry provide composite steels. The AAAC has an internal design house, but most of its staff are poached from appliance manufacturers.\nThe result are a series of small, playful cars with colourful paints and a friendly look. They‚Äôre sleek and fun without being toylike, and recall remarkable household appliance designs like Fettener Kettles or Vekllei Supernational television sets. Although AAAC autos are not yet atomic, they are almost entirely electric and fueled by Vekllei‚Äôs atomic and geothermal plants, legitimising the concern‚Äôs name partially.\nThe flagship of AAAC is the Cherry, the first mass-market vehicle the company has brought to international market. Several stereotypical errors were made introducing it to the non-Vekllei world, including the unusual name and even more unusual tagline ‚Äî ‚ÄúThe Future Car for an Eternal Summer.‚Äù In Vekllei, summer is a feminine, fragrant season of warmth and rebirth. The way it was transliterated makes it seem like a reference to the world‚Äôs rapidly destabilising climate and ecosystem, which is inching the globe towards economic collapse.\nThe car was a flop in the States, but saw moderate success in Europe.

I‚Äôm starting a series looking at the lives and machines of domestic Vekllei life.\nVekllei National Railways, or ‚ÄòVK Rail‚Äô was the bastard of six major pre-war rail companies that were extinguished along with the society that housed them. Today there are three rail companies in Vekllei, but all of them operate under direct supervision of a Vekllei Industry Bureau (making it Venrouiva, in other words) and are only broken up for reasons of logistics. So even though a train may run under the Montre Inclinantor Rail Company, it is fundamentally a Vekllei National Railways train much in the same way that all regional airlines are actually fully subsumed by Vekllei International Airways.\nA few characters you‚Äôll find at every manned Vekllei station have been illustrated below.\nThe first, the locomotive engineer, drives a train in four hour shifts. They wear a shoulder plate to distinguish them from other miscellaneous station staff and carry a pedigree in Vekllei culture, as a country dependent almost entirely on rail internally.\nEach station has a station master, who manages the station. In small stations, they do many types of work including maintenance and assisting public enquiry. In large stations, like Vekllei Central Terminus, there are dozens of station masters commanding multiple platforms each and are extremely demanding jobs.\nMost stations also have a most unusual employee, nicknamed in Vekllei a ‚Äòdaughter‚Äô or ‚Äòson of the station,‚Äô who are usually children or teen-agers particularly interested in entering employment with Vekllei Rail and are thus apprenticed in many different roles. They are usually taught some English in a special extracurricular programme and are used as guides for tourists, as Vekllei signage is usually written only in the country‚Äôs native tongue. After a few hours of miscellaneous works a child of the station might ride the trains, checking carriages and platforms for cleanliness and observing passenger behaviour.\nMore recently, stations have been adopting station dogs to help lift spirits among commuters and tourists alike. These dogs, usually of breeds too large for Vekllei apartment lifestyles, have no work but to meet people and offer pets to passing commuters. Some are trained in rescue and as service dogs to those who need them, but for the most part they are simply large dogs in uniform who wander with the station master or child of the station to look for love from strangers.\nAt nearly 20,000kms of rail, Vekllei has one of the most dense and intricate rail systems in the world. Stations are built to receive modern transonic maglevs and century-old steam engines simultaneously, and nearly 15,000 people are employed in some form to keep these railways running.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-08-16-station-dog/","title":"The People of Vekllei‚Äôs Railway (plus Dog)"},{"content":"","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/categories/archive/","title":"archive"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article predates the project, and should be considered non-canon.

Landscape:¬†for articles on Vekllei and her society, incorporating all that goes with it.  Otherwise, read on for an introduction to this project and what I intend to do with it.\nThe Epilogue to the Epoch of Rest The core of the Vekllei project¬†is in understanding utopian fiction as a viable means for expressing yourself in two arenas.¬†Creative, as a way of articulating a worldview, and personal, as a way of introspection and projection.\nIn this case, the creative worldview is that of Vekllei ‚Äî a thought experiment in economics, socialpolitik, infrastructure, architecture, demographics, spirituality, language, actualisation, etc. The personal product is Tzipora ‚Äî a character of good mannerisms, language, sense of fashion, ideological disposition, personality and body.\n The premise of an epoch of rest is that the problems unique to an author, the conductor of the orchestra, can be reasoned with and turned into beautiful monuments in a way they can‚Äôt in reality.\n Running low on money? Vekllei does not use money ‚Äî go to a cinema, eat out; have a nice time. Likewise, are you shameful of your body or your ability? Tzipora is fraught with problems, too ‚Äî but look at her!¬†She is beautiful. Repeat this process for all creative arenas and you will find a world you can escape to, away from the problems of your reality.\nKeep in mind that utopia and perfection are two different things.¬†A city can be utopian without it being perfect ‚Äî a relative judgement. Carrying on in this sense, the concept of utopia can equally be applied to a person. The character is not necessarily a romantic interest or charming or intelligent or sexual product, because none of those things really describe utopia ‚Äî instead, a person (a utopian?) is perfect as a collection of ideas and experience. Vekllei is a place of utopia, Tzipora is utopian. And so there are three actors in this project.\nThe Author The producer of the whole thing, the creative and personal products are theirs, as unique as a fingerprint. They most likely produce a lot of different societies and characters in trying to tell a story, or flesh out an idea they‚Äôve had ‚Äî but for the purposes of the idea of an epoch of rest, there are two perfect utopias: landscape (society and the world), and character (personality and appearance).\nVekllei [/v∆êk.la…™/] Vekllei is a country in which the external burdens of the world can be shifted. Worries are relegated to the personal ‚Äî an arena in utopian fiction that conveniently still falls under the domain of the author. In Vekllei, self-actualisation is tangible, vivid, only metres away. It might be in creativity or power or love, but it is attainable, because the economic and cultural orchestra of the country is in the imagination of the author, and so it is perfect as by definition of utopia.\nTzipora/Zelda Desmoines [/dz…™pÀà…îÀêr.…ô‚Äôd∆êm.w…ôÀên.∆êÀêh/] If Vekllei is the arena of external burden, Tzipora is a girl on which the internal pressures of self-doubt and conscious flaw are cast aside like a rag. In the sense of a narrative, Tzipora might suffer because of her behaviours (her nervous tics, her jealousy, her body and image), but they are adopted in a way that is graceful. So despite her fierce problems, it fades away in the fact that she will not die; she will not be unsuccessful; she will not be unloved. As long as those core premises are true, then every other nervous tic or obsessive-compulsive behaviour are commodity; window-dressing to an aesthetic taste.\nThis project is sort of what I want to do, and I can‚Äôt imagine slowing down anytime soon. Stick around and I‚Äôll do my best materialise the world and story of Vekllei.

Previous post\n On Tuesday, two casualties were reported among Vekllei‚Äôs Folifedestarmie 24th and 25th Garden Companies in the ongoing war to make the capital‚Äôs parks the finest in the world. Michael Helen-Louisviuan cut his leg on an exposed nail during the deinstallation of old fence posts, and Ana Po cut her thumb on a rose. Both attackers were neutralised appropriately, through planned deinstallation and some mild pruning. The reports were passed onto the local Garden command, where they were filed and will eventually be destroyed after ten years.\n In Vekllei, where a military service of four years is mandatory between the ages of 18 and 32, the purpose of conscription is twofold; first, to ensure the citizenry is at least lightly trained should an invasion follow a nuclear strike, and second; to ensure that important jobs in the country that are not easily automated are always filled.\nA breakdown of the most common roles a Vekllei person will enter upon conscription:\n Construction, 22% Misc. support roles for the armed forces, 18% Combat roles in the armed forces, 15% Arts work including architecture and garden preservation, 8% Local policing, 6% National policing, 4% Service roles, 4% Education, 2% Politics, 2% Other misc. work, 19%  The garden battalions are not simply the pacifist‚Äôs way out ‚Äî there are many other jobs for principled people. Instead, they appeal mostly to those nearing the end of their eligible conscription age who are looking to get service out of the way before family-making or major career advancement.\nIn this sense, conscription for most Vekllei people is a rite of passage that mimics preindustrial ritual, and otherwise defines the transition to adulthood in a country that has largely desegregated aged schooling. It is one of the few times in a Vekllei persons‚Äô life in which the organs of power of the country will interfere directly with their lives, making conscription a welcome structure for young Vekllei boys n gals not yet sure what to do with their lives. Indeed, many of the roles taken on during service will echo throughout their working lives, as gardeners become council planners and labourers become robotics engineers.\nThe truth of automation and work as pleasure is that the unfettered freedom and hedonism of the Vekllei lifestyle can often feel as aimless and agoraphobic as it does liberating. The four years of service in Vekllei‚Äôs military reflect Vekllei in total ‚Äî both in its confronting usurpation of traditional institutions by petticoat ideology and in its tantalising, insatiable liberty and pleasure.

Porno is available over-the-counter at most book stores. Some industry associations attempt to limit availability to minors but generally it\u0026rsquo;s at the discretion of the shopkeeper. Often, shame and embarassment are more powerful tools than legislation in Vekllei.\nGenerally it\u0026rsquo;s pretty traditional stuff supported by columns and fiction, although it varies between pornographers. It\u0026rsquo;s quite common for well-known Vekllei models to end up in nude shoots either before or after their fame. Nudity is a little more common in Vekllei than it is in the U.S. (at beaches and so on), and that relaxes the moralising of smut somewhat.\nThat said, the generation previous to Tzipora\u0026rsquo;s (about 20 years prior, so around the early 2050s) were very sex-positive and deviant. Certain cultural iconography from this time is still used in porno \u0026ndash; heavy makeup, curled hair, bare thighs \u0026ndash; but this has prompted a conservatism among Tzipora\u0026rsquo;s generation towards the \u0026ldquo;vanity\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;superficiality\u0026rdquo; of their parents' sexual liberation and bare skin.

Talking about utopia in landscape is easy ‚Äî Vekllei is a glittering midcentury paradise that fosters human life as a wonderful dream.\nTalking about utopia in character is much harder. How can you find utopia in flawed and sometimes unattractive human beings? By what metric is the vague, intuitive values of a utopia measured against a living person?\nIn Upen, the nondenominational animism of Vekllei, there is the living principle of Dumousiantopet: ‚Äúbeautiful and seperate‚Äù. This is a modernist reconciliation of Vekllei‚Äôs striking, symmetrical and clean Newda architecture school with Upen‚Äôs otherwise modest and naturalistic principles. This makes fine sense for cities and towns, in which the triumphant and monumental nature of Vekllei architecture is at odds with Vekllei‚Äôs efforts to deindustrialise through post-scarcity, but it also applies to human beings, as natural objects, in society. In Vekllei, architecture is not adapted to its environment, but built in spite of it, as recognition of Vekllei‚Äôs human-centric worldview.\nSimultaneously, however, Vekllei is a land and people deeply linked with their surrounds, in which purpose and value is drawn from their landscape and nature is an intrinsic part of life. Dumousiantopet does not mean the domination of nature by human construction, but to exist together in segregation of their different systems of beauty.\n Hence the concept of ‚ÄòHuman Decay‚Äô, or Lemdisiandan, a system of human beauty that warps intuitive Western principles (the symmetrical woman, the rational man, the healthy boy, the cute girl, and so on) and worships instead decay, which in Vekllei is a positive natural process that unites all life, including landscape and human beings. Where Vekllei might build a utopian city to last a thousand years, human beauty is acknowledged to be far less eternal; it is in fact fleeting, at once suspended in a single moment and returning slowly to absence, or ‚Äònothingness‚Äô. In Vekllei, it it this process (and how it manifests) in which beauty is found. It is the evidence of life; the symptoms of living; the detail of imperfections in human beings that validate their place on Earth.\n A worn shirt, windswept hair, sweat on your brow ‚Äî small images of dignity and history in how a person talks and carries themselves.\nSo how does this manifest? Here is Tzipora Lo Ula Desmoines, a girl who suffers from Gregori-Heitzfeld Syndrome. She is a perfect example of character utopia:\n She is very shameful about her body and her thinness. She is angry at a lot of things and cannot let bad memories die. She suffers from hypertension after her childhood, and is terrified of dogs and loud noises. Bad dreams interrupt her sleep. She is distinctive but well-kept, productive but inward-facing. She is afflicted with nervous tics that manifest as shirt-pulling and nose-rubbing and has had them for many years. They appear involuntarily in nervousness and pointing them out to her will only increase their intensity. She has obsessions about clothing materials and the material composition of outfits, which can affect her emotionally (she cannot stand a wool skirt and rayon shirt, for example, intersecting). These bizarre principles include the proportion and length of items, and the tightness and looseness of clothes.  This list could go on and on to paint a very uncomfortable and invasive picture of an otherwise quiet and happy person, but these examples neglect the many wonderful things about her ‚Äî her affection and good sense of humour, her humility and loyalty, and so on. But while these good things might be employed to counteract the bad to us, to a Vekllei person they would accentuate and complete a complex and positive picture of a girl touched by ‚Äòhuman decay‚Äô, an ugly phrase in English that essentially refers to the sweet detail and intricacies that evidence the life of a person.\nHuman Decay does not glorify anxiety or mental illness ‚Äî nor does it worship dirtiness for the sake of being dirty, or imperfection for being imperfect ‚Äî but it does recognise the greatness in the texture and detail of human life. So it is that in Vekllei, splotchy birthmarks and soft skin alike are the characteristics of a beautiful person, and lend to a metric of beauty defined by storytelling and complexity.\n A lot of how Tzipora would be remembered would be in the way she appeared in the person. She was a good-looking young teen-ager of quiet and unusual movements. As she became known to the wider public, her physical appearance would come to define her as both a phenomena and disability ‚Äî a victim of blessings; a sweet child of cotton and gingham carrying on in the dark schism between teen-age impetuosity and the adult world of power. What a tragedy and miracle she was.Zelda, which was how she introduced herself among friends, was as intricate as she was indecipherable. She had her own internal logics; a unique carousel of intuition that marked her out as some unfortunate undamoispotet among other teen-agers. In conversation that stirred any emotion in her she was susceptible to spasmodic, defensive movements that distracted from her talking. Most frequently she would pull on her nose as if to wipe it, or reach for her shirt at the shoulder and adjust it. If she was particularly self-conscious, which could be brought on even by the spasms themselves, she would take hold of her shirt and keep her hand there, as though her thin girlish arms could shield her breast from judgement. She confided in her father that she did not like the tics. The more conscious of her imperfections she was, the more her idiosyncrasies flared. He asked her once how long she‚Äôd had them ‚Äî the nose rubbings, the shirt pullings ‚Äî and she said she couldn‚Äôt remember, but thought it might have been after she arrived in America. Which was possible, he supposed ‚Äî trauma could bring on tics, even laymen knew that. If you spend a while with her, however, it becomes more obvious that her tics are symptomatic of a nervous, fidgety subconscious not cowed by the supposed tomboyishness of her movements ‚Äî she jigs a leg, and run the back of her hand beneath her nose. Then, when she realises people notice those things and judge her for them, the same synchronistic hyperactivities became shirt-pulling and face-touching.\n Thanks folks.

It is also how ‚Äònakedity‚Äù‚Äôbecomes ‚ÄòNewda‚Äô, the dominant architectural school in Vekllei, found almost everywhere.\nAs a sort of post-deco modernism, it retains the striking geometry and vertical movement of more decadent architectural styles, but employs them conservatively to better reveal naked shape ‚Äî ‚Äònewda‚Äô. It is a flexible school that manifests differently depending on the utility of the building. Residential apartments, for example, often display elements reminiscent of constructivism, where national bureaus, or ‚Äòhard buildings‚Äô as they‚Äôre called in Vekllei, are more brutalistic. The stripped classicism of buildings of authority stands in stark contrast to the playful googie of utilities like phone booths and public restrooms. These allusions to grand midcentury architecture are domesticated with a unique form of Vekllei populuxe, usually because of Vekllei‚Äôs use of colour and shape as a language in itself.\nSome have called it a \u0026lsquo;Paris moderne\u0026rsquo; for the hegemony of the modernist bastards in Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s architecture schools, but to Vekllei people, these space-age visions of the future are home.\nyou can check my reddit profile (and there\u0026rsquo;s a follow button there now, because reddit is Facebook) for more posts about Vekllei and Tzipora.\nwww.vekllei.city or insta fer more.

Previous post here.\n Six bodies hung from the Rodney Creek Railroad Bridge, without names. The leftmost corpse, which was a boy, had a sign slung around his neck with tomorrow‚Äôs 8am train on it. Besides the swaying boy was his father, and next to him was his mother, and so it went down the railroad bridge, counting off his little sisters and grandmama and so on. The baby had been thrown in the creek. Who they were didn‚Äôt matter much, since the types of people hanging from bridges and trees and lampposts were cut from the same cloth.\nLater that night, a man from the Kennecott Copper Company payed a sum of four and a half million dollars in cheque towards three bastards, two pigs and a thug. For that sort of money, you could buy a home to the North and the East, far out of Utah and far out of the violence. Not that any of them would leave ‚Äî the pigs had good jobs with the Sheriff‚Äôs office, the bastards had been born here and would die here, and, well, the thug just liked killing too much.\nYou could trace today‚Äôs nightmare back to the collapse of the Ford Motor Company, but there were problems in the southwest long before even that. The truth of it is that there‚Äôs been a lot of anger in Utah for a long time, it\u0026rsquo;s just taken a lot longer than anyone thought it would.\n It‚Äôs quite impossible to imagine the tragedy of the U.S. in 2094, where suffering can be predicted by the latitude at which it occurs and midcentury domesticity collides with violence and power. As the U.S. Dollar inflates wildly and the Atomic Age has priced out the working man, is it any wonder that Southerners waste away beneath horizons of the quiet, rusting manufacturing plants of the southwest, where the wind whistles between conveyors once carrying bits of Pontiacs and Fords?\nWhat we saw, as the Dallas Accords failed and the talks of a total secession ascended from fantasy, was the rise of militias, company cities, industrial action, bloodshed, lynchings, racial animosity, the death of suburbs, mass killings, child labour, sexual violence, decaying infrastructure, and so on. The air was electric with opportunity to live out your wildest, most depraved fantasies. Bizarre images of single-story cul-de-sacs and a half-dozen State police excavating portions of desert existed simultaneously. The free flow of immigrants between Mexico and Arizona was quickly seized upon and exploited by companies like Anaconda Mineral and Kennecott Copper, who filled their mines with Latin Americans to shut out striking workers.\nAn immigrant labourer was dead at the signing of his contract. He was killed by vigilantes, or in a mine accident, or was simply consumed, since these people did not have names and the companies had no expectations of their longevity. That attitude soon came to shadow almost every interaction between otherwise decent people of impoverished communities ‚Äî that there was no future, that they were the last generation, that the hedonistic cycle of production and consumption had become life itself.\nThe hedonism of brutality and modern pornography manifested in the violence of the company militias and local sheriffs alike, and so both cannibalism and necrophilia were widespread in oft-secret killings. Desecration of corpses, mutilation of the living, and widespread lawlessness came to characterise the hell that was life in the southern U.S. in 2094. How terrifying it was that beautiful things could decay so quickly.\nSo it was that men became creatures ‚Äî lust became necrophilic, suffering became ecstasy. This mad spiral towards our worst instincts came out in full force. The biopolitics of life and consumption became the necropolitics of grotesqueing and subsumption. A girl‚Äôs sandal; poisoned bread; leaded cosmetics; copper in the mountains; apricot phosphorous on the horizon; a nuclear family in the current; six Mexicans gutted; six good boys killing for cash; whole towns cashing in and shipping out.\nThat is life in Utah today.

Most of the kids pictured here are the cubs of lumberfolk who make a living out of felling hard pines in the mountains in the North of Vekllei. About half have dark hair and rounder faces, as descendants of both inuits and Scandinavians, and others are of mixed ancestry. Families in Vekllei are large and often nonbiological, and a single lad can have a dozen sisters. Ame Louisendopet might be a bitch on occasion, but that‚Äôs how it goes. Jo‚Äôs little sister, Popet, has decided age ten and a half that she‚Äôll be a locomotive engineer one day.\n As you may have learned by now, Vekllei is a land of contrasts. Last year, the Lonne Rail Authority commissioned a new generation of maglev trains for blistering five-minute commutes between Little Vekllei and the Lonne terminus, turning an otherwise 60km journey into an unconscious gesture. At a top speed of 750km/h, the pride of Vekllei‚Äôs commuter rail seems to gunning for subsonic commuter jets head-on.\nMeanwhile, in the mountains around Montre, the D-006 steam locomotive approaches her 130th birthday. Where the maglev guzzles direct current from atomic power plants around the country, D-006 chews through bunker fuel ‚Äî literal scrapings from a barrel somewhere ‚Äî and leaves soot where she goes. Her train is not carrying businessfolk but log cars bound for the coasts, where they will be sold to Europe for furniture. In the mornings of most weekdays, the engineers and lumberjacks that man her bring their children along for the trip, where the little ones watch the engineer work the cab while the teenagers shiver on her maintenance catwalks.\nShe is dirty, slow, and makes absolutely no sense occupying a route in the space age, one marked by moon colonies and new empire. What is going on here?\nThings begin to make a little more sense through the lens of an ordinary Vekllei person, with their own bizarre domestic intuition and frame of mind. Like we talked about previously, Vekllei understands the the achievements of industry as a liberationist tool to return to preindustrial, satisfying life. It is not as though the country will ‚Äòundo‚Äô three centuries of tremendous progress ‚Äî quite the contrary, in fact. But understood through petticoat ideology, the marriage of labour and the ordinary person can only occur through self-satisfying, personal work. This is in contrast, one can suppose, to mechanised, industrial labour to which we owe our enormous wealth. To a Vekllei person, work is social, productive, creative and satisfying. The simple pleasures of agriculture; specialised craftsman and tradesman; artistry ‚Äî these are the fruits only of a society that can afford them, since they necessitate the deindustrialisation of agriculture, factory manufacturing and mass media simultaneously.\nThe steam locomotive is ultimately a fetishisation of this sort of thinking ‚Äî it is an analogue machine, complicated while comprehensible to the ordinary person (unlike, say, atomic energy or even gas-turbine locomotives). It is enormous and impressive, and also nostalgic for many Vekllei people. In a place and time where money did not matter, as it does not in Vekllei, and productivity was an afterthought, as it is in Vekllei, they make perfect sense. These ‚Äòimages‚Äô; of rural labour assisted by steam locomotives; of children growing up with these machines; of the constant fetishisation and decommodification of the world ‚Äî these are currency in Vekllei. That is why this useless machine is a wonderful machine, and why a handful of steam locomotives mother their respective communities decades after their obsolescence.\nyou can check my reddit profile (and there\u0026rsquo;s a follow button there now, because reddit is Facebook) for more posts about Vekllei and Tzipora.\nwww.vekllei.city or insta fer more.

This is Tzipora. She goes by two names \u0026ndash; Tzipora, her birth name, and Zelda, a name she mistakenly thought sounded less Jewish. She lives in Lola in the Vekllei city-state.\nAs an immigrant, she struggles with school but holds her own on in track and field, an inversion of her otherwise quiet and bookish nature. She is intimidated by pretty girls and can throw a half-decent punch.\nGenetic Freak Gregori babies, as they\u0026rsquo;re called, suffer from Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome. It\u0026rsquo;s usually described as agelessness at menarche, since about 90% of cases are girls. It\u0026rsquo;s essentially a genetic malfunction that puts the body in a cycle of eternal growth \u0026ndash; they effectively continue to grow (without actually growing bigger), but do not develop and are more or less suspended at the onset of their first period.\nThe question of whether they\u0026rsquo;re \u0026lsquo;mentally\u0026rsquo; children is an interesting one that there\u0026rsquo;s not a simple answer to. Their minds are not fully developed the way an adult human\u0026rsquo;s would be, since ageing stops in early teen-age years and before pubescence. They tend to retain some childish characteristics \u0026ndash; mostly decision-making and emotional control. But this sort of speculation risks dehumanising otherwise very functional and capable people. The effects of long-term childhood and social isolation are far more profound on the personality of a Gregori child than any biological limitation or squabbling about the teen-age/adult schism.\nBoys can also have it, but are always hyperallergic and suffer from a broad anaphylaxis at onset of the condition (usually a little earlier, in early thelarche at 8-10y/o). It will almost always kill them. The discrepancy between the sexes is still being researched.\nGirls also have a risk of developing hyperallergies. Gregori babies have never developed cancers as far as anyone is aware, and these hyperallergies are a result of this hyperactive immune system.\nGregori babies fulfill the first of two miracles required for sainthood in the Catholic Church. In other parts of the world they are targets of violence as practicers of witchcraft or demonic pacts. The oldest Gregori baby, Tzipora Desmoines, is 120 years old and is set to overtake the human lifespan. She was 13th overall to have been diagnosed, but Gregori children have high mortality rates (largely violence, car accidents and suicides) and she is the first to pass 60 years of age. So, somewhat ironically, the children with speculated immortality almost always die young.\nKnowing her A lot of how Tzipora would be remembered would be in the way she appeared in the person. She was a good-looking young teen-ager of quiet and unusual movements. As she became known to the wider public, her physical appearance would come to define her as both a phenomena and disability ‚Äî a victim of blessings; a sweet child of cotton and gingham carrying on in the dark schism between teen-age impetuosity and the adult world of power. What a tragedy and miracle she was.\nZelda, which was how she introduced herself among friends, was as intricate as she was indecipherable. She had her own internal logics; a unique carousel of intuition that marked her out as some unfortunate undamoispotet among other teen-agers. In conversation that stirred any emotion in her she was susceptible to spasmodic, defensive movements that distracted from her talking. Most frequently she would pull on her nose as if to wipe it, or reach for her shirt at the shoulder and adjust it. If she was particularly self-conscious, which could be brought on even by the spasms themselves, she would take hold of her shirt and keep her hand there, as though her thin girlish arms could shield her breast from judgement. She confided in her father that she did not like the tics. The more conscious of her imperfections she was, the more her idiosyncrasies flared. He asked her once how long she‚Äôd had them ‚Äî the nose rubbings, the shirt pullings ‚Äî and she said she couldn‚Äôt remember, but thought it might have been after she arrived in America. Which was possible, he supposed ‚Äî trauma could bring on tics, even laymen knew that. If you spend a while with her, however, it becomes more obvious that her tics are symptomatic of a nervous, fidgety subconscious not cowed by the supposed tomboyishness of her movements ‚Äî she jigs a leg, and run the back of her hand beneath her nose. Then, when she realises people notice those things and judge her for them, the same synchronistic hyperactivities became shirt-pulling and face-touching.\nI love questions, so please let me know if you have any!

Nestled between the regional tram offices and the pre-war Ferouistet Department Store, the Lola district is not known for much but her department store and good schools. It sits on the slope of the wide Vekllei capital basin, where the Atlantic can be seen from the street. It was Tzipora\u0026rsquo;s first home in Vekllei, and it was where she lived with her father. The schools were good, the kids were all right, and the trams were a gift from Christ.\nMost of Vekllei looks like Lola, marked by her mid-rise streets and public thermal ponds and geyser baths (named after the Vekllei village of Geyser, as it happens). Vekllei people do not generally own cars, and mostly commute via the metro, the exhaustive tram network or on occasion in a loan car from the autopool. The streets are narrow and empty of traffic save for service vehicles, and in the summers they are invaded by neighbourhood children playing baseball or seeking shade under the street trees.\nLola is one of hundreds of neighbourhoods in the vast, densely-populated capital of the country from which it aquires its namesake. It is a city facing its past, now that there is plenty to eat and little to do \u0026ndash; and as a sprawling urban utopia with a fierce nostalgia for preindustrial life, there is no other place like it on Earth. Caught at once between the future of space and helijets, and her collective memories of agriculture and simple labour, Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s petticoat society marks a departure from futurism and a turn to its history, as though the violence and suffering and chaos of the past three centuries were but a chore obstructing utopia.\nParticipatory Economics \u0026amp; Property In Vekllei‚Äôs feminised parpolity, the revitalisation of Upen brought about an ancient understanding of property reborn in the widespread poverty of Vekllei society following the first Atomic War. Widespead social regression and cross-generational nostalgia for preindustrial life took hold in urban Vekllei society almost immediately after the atomic fire, as the ruins of colonial and imperial society lay around the Vekllei people. The monarchy, a tokenistic and fashionable invention of the gilded Mercantile age just three centuries before, evaporated nearly overnight with the death of the king. So, too, did the military junta salivating over the charred remains of the capital find it nearly impossible to consolidate power in a city now without infrastructure. In the ashes of modern industrialisation grew tempered, atomised communities of streets and villages ‚Äî the common council as we see it today. Food production returned to the city in the ruins of vast factories, wide canals were dug for unmotorised barges, and councils of working people organised self-interest in these communities, which would be understood a century later as Sundress Municipalism. So too did the common understanding of property evaporate.\nThe old libertarian bugbear of the origins of property was revived ‚Äî the population had been decimated, Vekllei people were surrounded by vast swaths of useless land of deceased ownership, and the institutions of old society had failed to retake power following the war. The question of ownership was pertinent, as it would clarify the sovereigns of future society. The sovereignty of Vekllei, as it would later be determined, is decentralised and portioned between any land-operating individual, local organisations, municiple councils, and syndicates. This tradition carries on today. In any one apartment building or row-house, you will find the inhabitants, building administrators, local councils and tenant unions exercising types of ownership over a space. In other words; residents of a home will have implied ownership over a home, but a community has implied ownership over the community itself. The intersection of different kinds of ownership result in complex and partially uncoded laws that, although vulnerable to beaurocratic and exhaustive legal disputes, are mostly discarded in place of local opinion.\nThe foundation of the Vekllei political and economic system is the community; a population larger than a single family and small enough to have valuable social bonds; a group of people bound by common living, work, and recreation. An unruly or criminal tenant is more likely to be run out of town by his neighbours than by the courts. This is not to misrepresent the daily conflicts of Vekllei domestic society ‚Äî disputes are common and meaningless. But abuse of common ownership is tempered by the fact that it is quite impossible to evict any individual from his home without overwhelming agreement of his neighbours, essentially relegating formal council ownership to irrelevency; the true owners of any single home are, in practice, the community in which it is situated, supervised by protections offered under the local judicial councils.\nThe ownership of a factory is a lot more straightforward ‚Äî the old mantra of the democratic workplace is more or less true here. Principally, unautomated (manned) factories recieve production requests from one of the hundreds of different economic bureaus keeping stock of production in the country, which otherwise do not directly supervise production except in circumstance of scarcity. Production requests are voluntary, and usually formalities in the production of items for local consumption. Heavily centralised industries, particularly heavy industries like raw product extraction and refining, usually operate under direct supervision of a bureau. Unions exist independently of the bureau system and usually hold membership from every worker of a factory, including managers. Mirroring nested councils, there are also larger industry unions that generally involve themselves only in general strikes and legal cases without precedent.\nThe ownership of a grocery store is clear and implied, if not codified. The person who manages and works the shop, either through implied property bonding (so-called ‚Äòfolk morality‚Äô; a phenomena largely dependent on the person‚Äôs social value and local consent) or familial tradition, owns the shop. These are not lawful protections of ownership ‚Äî indeed, Vekllei common law says very little about senrouive business ownership ‚Äî but in almost every case, they are validated by a community intuitively. Even antisocial or hostile shop-owners are rarely challenged on their right to the property they manage ‚Äî the shop is, technically speaking, seen as an extension of the natural landscape (as no more than fired clay and timber), and the live-and-let-live culture in Vekllei is sympathetic to leaving people to their business and shop elsewhere. Legal disputes on the right to live above and manage a store are relatively rare, and usually resolved through ‚Äòblood rights‚Äô ( similar to ‚Äòfolk morality‚Äô) in the case of an individual or in a more democratic fashion involving multiple relevant complainants, like employees. In both of these examples, the disputed property is considered an entity itself with its own rights and interests extrapolated from its history and surrounding landscape.\nHerein remains the distinction between venrouiva/senrouive property, and their implied ownership. Venrouiva usually operate in cooperation with the product bureaus in the case of manufacturing, or other national organisations as their industry requires in education, medicine, power, water, etc. They are ultimately beholden to the direction of the country, as organised by the seats of power and politics. Senrouive exists somewhat independent of the economy entirely, recieving mostly what it asks for and immersing their respective economies in the communities around them. Although all physical material in Vekllei is ultimately property of the country (a vague, naturalistic construct seen as distinct from the government, at least in a Western understanding), senrouivewill almost never be managed directly by larger unions or administrative bodies. This distinction does little to articulate public and private ownership, as the very concept of property remains formally unacknowledged in the economy in the country. Instead, all business today is conducted in cooperation with the ideas of community, implied ownership, self-interest and some sort of idea of supply and demand largely usurped by post-scarcity and widespread automation.\nBecause of this, Vekllei does not actually consider itself classless ‚Äî Indeed, venrouiva are fundamentally a coordinating class of workers that are atomised from senrouive work through their power and decision-making. They are a class of power in law, education, science, medicine, and politics, and consequently, guide the direction of the country. Although even senrouive business is still fundamentally worker-owned and managed (as part of Sundress Municipalism), this hierarchy remains in principle, even if the quality of life of venrouiva and senrouive workers is in practice identical. This fact is rarely acknowledged outside of technical circles in the country, because it matters very little to the common Vekllei person. Vekllei is not outwardly egalitarian, despite practice, and the problems of power are mitigated by a mess of democratic structures ultimately enslaved to self-interested, independent communities of people. For one of the most centralised countries in the world, with a homogenous ethnic people and culture, Vekllei is better described as hundreds of thousands of hamlets than a single city.\nthis section is continued on my website: www.vekllei.city.

The Palace Gods live in decadence in an isolated and incestuous land above the mortal planes called the Palace. They do not eat and will live forever, provided they stay within the gardens of the Palace and consummate their industrial godhood occasionally with domen, an opium that they believe purifies blood.\nAdult Palace Gods are almost entirely women, but birthrates of boys and girls are about equal. At the onset of puberty, boys can enter rituals to become female gods, but sexual pleasure will stain their transition and thus romentet (as they‚Äôre called in god-tongue) will never maintain blood parity with female Palace Gods. Boys who enter sexual acts or allow sexual thoughts will not transition correctly and instead be consigned to serfdom for the rest of their lives (and in the impurities of their blood, they will be dead by forty).\nThe intersection of the Palace hierarchy and immortality mean that adult Palace Gods are terrified of deposition by younger generations. Older gods will often take an oath of chastity or, failing that, attempt to sabotage the blood purity of god-children to ensure they do not grow up to threaten their positions of power. Adult women often enter relationships with boys for this reason, which will prevent their transition and rise to power and instead grant them mortality. Young girls, however, cannot be dispossessed of their powers so easily. Homosexuality is strictly forbidden in the Palace, and so girls are often tricked into destroying their potential in rituals known as bloodfits.\nAs inhabitants of the Palace do not need to eat, it means that they do not consume the souls of other creatures. According to their own tapestry myth, their spiritual veganism has come to be a core lifestyle on which godhood is predicated. Young goddesses are often curious about mortal pleasures like food and body functions, and so particularly manipulative adult gods will trick them into eating meat and thus consuming the soul of another creature. After the meat is consumed (the quantity rarely matters, so long as the goddess in general understands they have eaten it), their sin is revealed to them and that knowledge sparks a spiritual crisis in the young goddess that collapses their powers and their physical presence in the Palace.\nWhere they go is unknown to anyone still living in the Palace ‚Äî to those unfortunate girls tricked into bloodfit, they find themselves in a land not quite Pachinki (the mortal planet) or the Palace (the central harbour for gods). Instead, there exists a realm constructed of young gods‚Äô ideas of what mortal life might be like, complete with the idealism and fear of the unknown beyond their Palace lifestyles. They begin to breathe for the first time ‚Äî a terrifying experience to a goddess previously unused to it ‚Äî and will experience weather, texture, and sunlight for the first time. Their clothes will suddenly have weight, and their wings are now vestigial relics of magic-aided flight. Many girls simply pass out, unable to deal with the shock of reality.\nMost stories here end happily though, in a trend unusual for Pachinki and the Palace. The in-between world these goddesses find themselves in is constructed of their hope and curiosity of Pachinki, too. Green pastures of stunning colour and flower-meadows straight out of their wildest fantasies are never far away. A community of ex-goddesses actively look for new girls and help them integrate into the material world. With time, the Palace life simply doesn‚Äôt compare.\nUloah, pictured here, is one of the most recent goddesses to be tricked into committing bloodfit. She was unwittingly fed her own pet peacock, and ended up in the salt lakes of the in-between realm. Any god trying to eat for the first time is a messy affair. After a day of desperate tears and despair as she wandered aimlessly, she came across two beautiful goddesses about her age in Palace clothes. They took her to a village with homes made of long grass populated entirely by her kin. A life of pressures and treachery in the Palace was replaced with the simple pleasures of quiet agriculture and play.\nSo why is so much of the magic of the Palace Gods predicated on myth and tradition? After all, it is not a potion or gemstone that strips goddesses of their power. The truth of it, understood by very few and acknowledged by fewer, is that the Palace Gods are sustained entirely by their own myth, with no future or past.\nPrincess Torah, the revolutionary ex-goddess that would eventually liberate the mortal Pachinki from the Palace, said as such in her early writings:\n The Palace Gods are not gods because of bloodlines, despite their insistence. They will tell you it is hereditary, and that blood is colloquial for purity, but they are misunderstanding their own myths. They preach immortality, but can be slaughtered like failing livestock if you‚Äôd only realise it. They are not gods because they are better equipped to employ ancient magic, or because they have unlocked the secret of eternal life. They are gods because they‚Äôve fallen for the fiction that sustains them ‚Äî they are monarchs because they believe in the monarchy, they are cruel because they believe in cruelty, and they subjugate because that is how they‚Äôve read the elaborate tapestry their ancestors constructed. So when Princess Moswen, my martyr and humanist sister (rest her soul), descended to the human people and addressed them universally without regard to race or subcontinent, she called the Gods what they were ‚Äî tokens writing simultaneously their past and future, failing their own present. Waxen, pastel nepotists misunderstanding their fiction as constitution.\n -\u0026mdash;-\nPachinki isn\u0026rsquo;t a normal constructed world. It has its own canon. It is a creation of Tzipora, who is the character utopia of my worldbuilding project. Soon after she moves to Vekllei, she\u0026rsquo;s pretty friendless and surrounded by pulpy paperback novels.

Rena‚Äôs little boy was found in the closest town with his guts turned out and his throat cut. They didn‚Äôt tell it to Rena like that, but that‚Äôs what happened to him. His village and people, the Lehmanen, are descendants of Palace Gods forced out of the heavens some millennia ago over their refusal to smoke Domen, a sort of opium of the Gods and essential practice in the Palace.\nAs descendants of Palace Gods, many still carry birthstones in their bodies ‚Äî small gems buried in the heart of the gut, beneath the stomach. These birthstones are very powerful magical artefacts and fetch a high price in Pachinki‚Äôs larger and less magical kingdoms. Rena‚Äôs little boy, who was not yet ten, had been taken by pirates looking for his stone and killed. The great tragedy of it was that he was fathered by a man from Zen ‚Äî the boy had not inherited a birthstone from his mother.\nHe was her only child and she‚Äôd been widowed in the war. The chief of their village announced a month of mourning and fasting in his memory. Once the period had passed, life went on. Rena resumed work in the mineral swamps in which Lehmanen live. The roots and algae that grow in these waters sustain communal village life and produce potions of medicinal value, including leprosy and tuberculosis vaccines.\nTwo months after the murder of her only child, Rena came across a stone that struck her dumb with shock. It was her boy‚Äôs face, unmistakeable in the perfection of the diorite, caught in the terror and pain of his final moments. It hadn‚Äôt been there the month before. She waded over to it but found no other indication of its origin.\nThat boy was only the first. As more people died, and the village went through its cycles of joy and grief, the swamp slowly began to fill with the forms of the dead. Heads of the fog. The Lehmanen were confused and angry by the insensitivity of the mineral swamp, and couldn‚Äôt understand why it was happening. Something was intercepting the quiet grief of these isolated people and resurrecting the memory of the dead. Was it the minerals? The wind? Something beneath the waters? Was it even a phenomena so simple as to assign to a single force of nature?\nNearly a year after the death of Rena‚Äôs little boy, another head appeared, joining dozens already hidden in the fog of the mineral swamps. This one was identical to the diorite totems before it. But it was unique.\nThis one was of Rena ‚Äî and she was very much alive.\nPrevious posts here and here.\n‚Äî\nThe Pachinki pangea is home to six subcontinents of old magic, mostly inherited from the Palace Gods, who are worshipped by urban centres to this day. The Lem subcontinent is sparsely populated, as the minerals of its many swamps are rife with disease (an illness contracted here, of which there are many, are called plaguentart in Lem or honeydeath in the Zen tongue).\nThe Lem are ignorant of the much older magic of the swamps, which predates perhaps even the Palace itself. As stupid to it as they are ultraviolets, the people of Pachinki can only react to the manifestations of it, and will never harness the raw, low-frequency power of ancient harmonics.\n‚Äî Footnotes ‚Äî\nPachinki is the creation of a fourteen-year-old girl in my world, Vekllei.\n So Pachinki occasionally lurches into horror otherwise incongruous with the sweet fantasy Tzipora shows such affection for. Pachinki may be a world of peace and wonder, but just like Tzipora‚Äôs own present utopian surrounds, it belies a historical context of starvation, mass graves and political violence. Part of the wonder of Pachinki, looking back, is that Tzipora seemed keenly aware of the prohibitively dark nature of this kind of violence in her otherwise escapist whimsy, and this maternal turbulence with her own work is so obvious that even the most casual reader will be conscious of its inconsistency. A page about the pleasure of tasting fruit gems will pirouette into musings on the use of slavery in their procurement and the sabotaging of their production to justify conquest and war. The surreal dissonance of her own motivations for creating Pachinki reflect a girl who was herself living a surreal, contradictory existence ‚Äî at her time of writing, she was living in a land of plenty and peace, where just a year before she was nearly killed after grocers in Cherry started poisoning their food waste to drive away homeless and vagrants. Her own existence was one of startling contrast ‚Äî a rapid transition to petticoat society from the misery of the American South, where she witnessed indiscriminate slaughter, sexual violence and crippling poverty. Whatever hurts is real, and so Vekllei did not feel real to her ‚Äî and consequently, Pachinki is suspended in the same internal turmoil.\n Pachinki isn\u0026rsquo;t a normal constructed world. It has its own canon. It is a creation of Tzipora, who is the character utopia of my worldbuilding project. Soon after she moves to Vekllei, she\u0026rsquo;s pretty friendless and surrounded by pulpy paperback novels.

Of course, the henchmen come from the heavens and are summoned for singular purposes, usually surveillance or sabotage. Tzipora was always very clear on the limitations of the Palace Gods, and their struggles to enter the mortal world, a weakness that inhibited the successful recapture of their runaway princess, Tora. In fact, Tora‚Äôs ability to enter the mortal world without the collapse of her mind, as dictated by the schism between planes, was more shocking in itself than her youthful betrayal. In many ways, Tora is a self-insert that witnesses much of the tragedy Tzipora had to come to terms with and rationalise in her early years in the American South. In this context, the Pinkerton moniker makes sense in Tzipora‚Äôs mind ‚Äî just as Tora later attempts to organise Pachinki into a revolt against the Gods (with brutal suppression on the part of the henchmen), Tzipora herself witnessed bloody strikebreaking several times as she rode freight trains on Southern Pacific, a freight company that experienced violent industrial action shortly before its bankruptcy.\n And further;\n So Pachinki occasionally lurches into horror otherwise incongruous with the sweet fantasy Tzipora shows such affection for. Pachinki may be a world of peace and wonder, but just like Tzipora‚Äôs own present utopian surrounds, it belies a historical context of starvation, mass graves and political violence.

A hundred years ago, the fortress existed as a spectre of the neighbouring villages; a beast of suffering and woe with fingers deep into the mountains around Montre. In the waning days of the military junta, the beast‚Äôs creators, the Sugarhouse Fort served as a strategic command centre for Vekllei‚Äôs nuclear arsenal and a blacksite to disappear the most prolific and dangerous agitators.\nThe Fort was not finished when the bombs fell, and it sat abandoned for a half-century as the scorched fragments of Vekllei society were preoccupied with their total devastation. It was not until Vekllei‚Äôs reemergence as a great power, and one that was convinced of an imminent nuclear war, that the Fort was reoccupied as one of the largest buried forts in the world, rivalled only by the Moscow Metro complex and Cheyenne Mountain‚Äôs extensions in the late 2080s.\nThe Fort is no longer a spectre of the nearby villages ‚Äî in fact, commute between them is so regular that a special railway has been installed into the heart of the fort, where many thousands of locals work as labourers, switchboard operators, engineers, administrators and research scientists. The fort houses Vekllei‚Äôs international telephone exchange, her largest geothermal research outfit attached to Montre University, Vekllei‚Äôs nuclear command buried deep in the ganglia of the fort, the auxiliary national railway control, Vekllei‚Äôs fourth-largest nuclear shelter system, and many other bureaus of national importance that have been relocated away from the capital city in fear of their destruction there.\nThe high-frequency telephonics and radar suck so much power that they would cause blackouts in nearby towns if they were both activated at the same time. As a modern all-electric fort with complex electrified munitions transport systems and pumps, her power plants are modern and overhauled every decade or so.\nTwo supercritical hydrothermic geothermal power plants at opposite ends of the fort operate as primary sources of power. In other countries they would be prohibitively expensive \u0026ndash; high-temperature geothermal sources have a high failure rate and require extraordinarily complex infrastructure to construct. These two plants (Suzie East and Ame West) have wells nearly five kilometres deep (just over 16,100ft), and capitalise on the plate margins of the European and American tectonic plates, which Vekllei straddles.\nThe fort is inherently outdated in an age of thermonuclear weaponry (although her shelters deep below the Earth are estimated to be impenetrable even to several direct strikes), but Vekllei is not a large country and the viability of mobilised command for civilian bureaus, like that found U.S. and the Soviet Union, is limited. The country has an affection for infrastructure, a fact of no surprise to anyone who has been there, and it is the size of the fort, and its decentralised network of tunnels throughout much of the Montre-Sugarhouse mountain range, that serve as primary defences in the face of a second nuclear war.\n This image here is a \u0026lsquo;pocket\u0026rsquo; telegram signed with love. The fort is one of the largest construction projects of the last two centuries, and is a point of pride among the people of the North. In all their agrarian and peaceful living, Sugarhouse Fort has no equal in anything in the industrious South of the country.\n -\u0026ndash;\nthanks for stopping by. www.vekllei.city fer more. follow me on reddit or insta for all that good vekllei shit\nPlease let me know if you have any questions!\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-03-10-fortress/","title":"The Sugarhouse Mountain Fortress"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article predates the project, and should be considered non-canon.  We best know Vekllei as a dense society of utopia and great infrastructure today, but there was blood in that crucible. It is difficult to imagine that only fifty years ago these streets were unpaved and impassible with the rubble of old society. Shadows on concrete marked the souls lost in the arrogance of the monarchy. The nuclear fire was pregnant with a new generation of people, who, in the principles of upen, would forge a new society out of the ruins of the old.\n Back then girl‚Äôs shirts weren‚Äôt made of cotton and you wore holes in your shoes. He was part of the budoinetnoikotet, or the ‚Äòwar children‚Äô. His parents had lived through the first atomic war, and he was the born in the shadow of it.\nIn that time the currency had completely collapsed, and so people traded within their own communities in an awkward return to preindustrial life. Often, people‚Äôs best clothes were their uniforms, and so that was what they took photos in. This photo sits on the commode in the living room, next to a vase of lilies.\nHe remembered sour details of his teen-age impetuosity. How he insisted he remove his glasses for the photo, insulting his bespectacled father in doing so. How his mother argued with his sister over the appropriate length of her fountain hairpiece. The women wore their family gi, ceremonial quarter-pleats, and he\u0026rsquo;d had his hair cut.\nHe thought a lot about his sister, Amelie. She was beautiful and clever and had a weird sense of humour. He‚Äôd loved her a lot. She confided in him as teen-agers‚Äî about problems with friends, her rampant insecurities, her dreams of the future. It turned out she‚Äôd had a beast in her lungs and it took her when she was fifteen. That was how it went back then, in the poverty of the city. To think a hundred years earlier tuberculosis had been a rumour. That is what war does to a country. He was not even afforded the dignity of anger. The English had been right to bomb them.\nLife was different now, of course. Vekllei was strong, and although he was not much wealthier, there was more to be had. The country had flourished in the ruins of the old society. Now he watches his own child sport the uniform his sister once wore, and when she smiles at him she looks like Amelie.\n Vekllei developed rapidly in the face of total destruction. In the space of fifty years the country consolidated infrastructure and its rural population into a powerful city-state of autonomous, rugged agrarian hamlets, they themselves flowers of the extinct monarchy and military junta. In some ways it was an exciting time to be alive \u0026ndash; there was now plenty to be had. No-one was hungry.

The subcontinent of Zen on the Pachinki pangea is so weathered by enormous gem deserts that there is scarcely enough space to grow wheat for bread. In places where the soil is too thin for heavy wheats, sparrowgrass is grown. This grass has large heads that can be eaten raw and taste citrusy and acidic as they only grow in toxic soils.\nBattered by gem storms, where holy winds pick up stones from the deserts and scatter them, the people of Zen live a hard and honest life. They have forsaken Palace Gods, and have consequently lost a lot of their fertility. Since marriage is dissolved upon failure of a child, Zen has many lonely and desperate spinsters. Driven nearly mad by their childlessness, it is possible to give birth to ‚Äògem children‚Äô by crushing certain magic gemstones and consuming that powder with normal edible fruit gems. After a short labour of about a month, an extraordinarily painful pregnancy precedes a dangerous birth that kills about half of gem-pregnant women.\nThe child is undeniably beautiful ‚Äî with a perfect colour and a glitter like no other, gem children are otherwise just like you or me. They usually find themselves popular among other village children as objects of wonder. In poorer Zen regions beyond the large wheat kingdoms, they are targets for pirates who whisk them away in airships and sell them to slavers on mainland Pachinki, since gem children are prized as well-groomed, beautiful servants of the aristocracy. This is somewhat misguided, as the majority of gem children that live in Zen live an unglamorous, happy life in agriculture.\nThey are extremely strong ‚Äî with nearly no limit to their ability to push and crush ‚Äî but are easily threatened by frequencies that shatter gems. One can easily hold themselves up with a single finger. They move gracefully though and have universally fine motor skills, so they have never harmed a fleshed human unintentionally. Grace here is caught mid-leap to a single handstand. With her fine balance and limitless energy, she could stay there forever if she chooses.\nGem children are kept alive by love, and as long as they are loved by someone ‚Äî their mother, the community, friends ‚Äî they will live forever. They also grow up, and stop physically ageing in their early twenties. Tragically, many gem children that are kidnapped die soon after as they are thrust into unloving environments.\nMarried gem children often move abroad with their partners, since their appearance makes them popular fortune-tellers, spell-casters or oath-breakers.\nGem deserts are mesmerising and a joy to wander, but you must only walk with a low sun or at night. Even in a bright moonlight, the brilliance of the gems can easily blind you for days, sometimes forever. They symbolise Zen as a people and as a landscape, and are one of the oldest shifting monuments on Pachinki.\n--\nPachinki isn\u0026rsquo;t a normal constructed world. It has its own canon.

As part of sundress municipalism, Vekllei‚Äôs villages and townships are mostly self-sufficient and self-regulating.

The villages are large and concrete now, but the people are are still there.\nSo does it surprise anyone that the police are just as much caregivers as law enforcement? That‚Äôs the thing about cultural matriarchy ‚Äî even old moustachioed crustaceans like Teddy Roresoin here are mothers in the consciousness of the country.\nTeddy came from shipbuilders and he was desperate to avoid becoming his parents. He enlisted in the Navy, but at university his politics soured on dying in some hole in Taiwan and he returned to his seaside prefecture. His office in the station overlooks the dry dock where his parents once worked. In his day it birthed large trawlers of fatty Atlantic salmon. Today it makes nuclear submarines.\nHe didn‚Äôt mean to have a child, much less a daughter, and she turned out to be everything he was terrified of. In Vekllei, they are called ‚ÄòLodoinopotet‚Äô, which fits into English best as ‚Äòwoman-girls‚Äô or \u0026lsquo;girly girl\u0026rsquo;. It evokes a specific image ‚Äî a high-school girl with modified uniform, enamoured by useless trinkets like perfume and rouge.\nMay, his daughter, was not always close with her father but her mother did not stick around long and so it was how it was. She did not intend to become a police officer in school. She spent most of her schooling life having her heart broken by a whirlwind of paper friendships and easy boyfriends. With no qualifications and mediocre grades, she asked her father for a job. She found out she liked it, and the people she policed liked her, too. These days she patrols their hometown together with her father, killing time and making friends. She used to wear makeup heavy like the inner-city girls. She was ashamed of a beauty mark near her mouth. Nowadays it doesn‚Äôt bother her much.\nOne of her favourite of the town‚Äôs children is Laura and her brother Rike, which is a brutish-sounding name but he‚Äôs a sweet boy. He loves her dad and her father lets him wear his officer‚Äôs cap. May‚Äôs pushing thirty now and her father‚Äôs on the winter side of fifty, and her worries of marrying right out of school are far behind her now ‚Äî she has enough children to fill a village.\nThe story might be saccharine, but that‚Äôs what no crime and community policing does to constable. It takes these masculine warriors of a community and makes them mums. Vekllei people‚Äôd have it no other way.

Because the other girls would not stop calling her a lesbian, and because they had realised she was scared of loud noises and made use of that fact, Tzipora struck this bitch and her friend out beyond the football pitches after school. Tzipora was a good fighter ‚Äî on her side is viciousness and a conviction to fight. That‚Äôs usually enough for most teen-agers, who like the idea of fighting but are unprepared for the unglamorous reality of it. But those things do not make up for being short and underweight, and the two older girls had her bleeding on the ground by the time two passing community police-officers pulled them apart.\nAs an officer examined Tzipora‚Äôs head with a torch to find the bleeding in her scalp, one of the girls was desperately explaining that Tzipora had swung first and out of nowhere. Tzipora had nothing for her defence, since it was true and since she did not speak to cops, but the policewomen figured it out for themselves easily enough. Tzipora had been beaten savagely in her foolhardy attempt to get back at her bullies, and her pitiful state made the girl‚Äôs desperate blame-passing petty and childish. Although she might have lost the fight, she was not bothered again by the two older girls.\n Part of the difficulty in understanding Vekllei as a foreigner is in the basic assumptions we make through the lens of modernity. Vekllei has not discovered ‚Äòlandscape‚Äô, and it has not discovered ‚Äòthe Child‚Äô.\nNow, children have existed since ever, but we live in an age of modernity and commodity ‚Äî of nuclear power and department stores. The concept of the ‚Äòchild‚Äô as we currently identify and understand it did not exist prior to a certain time, in which the rapid accessibility of both industrial goods and luxury in society stripped children of their productive relationships with family and labour, and introduced them to the beast that would become modern schooling. As Kojin Karatani writes about the Meiji Restoration:\n ‚Ä¶ It becomes clear that the grouping of children by age in the compulsory educational system of modern Japan signified the uprooting of children, as abstract and homogenous entities, from productive relations, social classes, and communities that had previously been their concrete contexts.\n Now, Vekllei is not Japan. Vekllei is caught, instead, between a spectre of modernity and the myth of its past. At once socialistic and deeply conservative, the intuition of the common Vekllei person is going to be fundamentally different to a person acclimatised to foreign society.\nVekllei has a modern compulsory education system like much else of the world, but the way in which Petticoat society is coloured by Upen forces a strange compromise between modernity and Vekllei‚Äôs agrarian past. Tzipora, for example, shares a classroom with students both older and younger than herself. Boys and girls wear a single uniform, shared with teachers, all the way from kindergarten to university. Compulsory school operates only three or four days a week and lasts only for a few hours. Work and play, in addition to education, have always been essential parts of childhood in the country and modern schooling has accommodated that. By the time a child is a teen-ager, the person has essentially transitioned into young-adulthood.\n By sexual maturation, a Vekllei person has essentially transitioned to young-adulthood and submerged themselves in the productive relations of the adult age; they often leave school for work, they quickly drift to mature, independent relationships with parents, and generally marry young.\n The consequence of this idea is that Vekllei people often attend some sort of school for most of their lives. Whether trade schools for work or adult learning institutions for personal curiosity, it is very common to fill the many free hours of a Vekllei person\u0026rsquo;s week with education of some kind.\nThis is not to mislead the reader into imagining adults and children mixing freely, either in compulsory schooling or wider society. Adults do not attend compulsory schools and the median age of a classroom rarely deviates more than a few years either side. But from the perspective of the child, growing up in Vekllei desegregates children from one-another and introduces them to mature economic and social relationships early on, allowing in theory real liberty to choose and work for your lifestyle in the country.\n-\u0026ndash;\nThis scene takes place in a Kadesoinan park, as indicated by the offerings bench and concrete paths snaking through water. In the distance is the Lola Neighbourhood School, with its central classroom tower standing six stories high. In the city beyond is Atomic Park and its distinctive, massive sculpture.\nI‚Äôm still feeling out my ideas on this piece, and I‚Äôll update this post as I figure it out.

She had always been a very serious girl, from the first time he‚Äôd met her. It was more than a reflection of character; it was how she talked, how she carried herself. Her clothes were plain, her nervous tics were not that funny, and she was afflicted with all sorts of fears and anxieties. She opens her mouth in public and what comes out is usually of serious opinion ‚Äî a judgement of something or a political remark. But that is not how Gregori syndrome works. It does not take young girls and make them old. As the months wore on and the length of the days reflected the passing of warm season, he learned well enough that she was a teen-ager, despite her seriousness. She was slowly domesticated into regular society, her conversation became casual, and she started to worry more about things that might have been inconceivably petty in the months before.\nIn late November they put up the tree, at her insistence. She was six months a citizen at this point, and not yet familiar with all the familial traditions of the country. But she knew Christmas. And that became her season. This chick, awash with anxiety and domestic terror, was fucking around with ornaments he‚Äôd left in the box for five years.\n‚ÄòDo you mind if I put the angel up the top?‚Äô She asked him. She was kneeling at the foot of the tree with a sample of tree-toppers spread out before her. He looked up from his paper.\n‚ÄòWhy would I mind?‚Äô\n‚ÄòI just thought you might.‚Äô\n‚ÄòDo what you like, I don‚Äôt mind.‚Äô\nShe shook her head and shifted back on her rump.\n‚ÄòIt‚Äôs no fun if you‚Äôre not helping. I have no idea what to do, I haven‚Äôt had a proper tree since I was eight.‚Äô\nHe put the paper to the side and rubbed his eyes under his spectacles. He breathed out slowly.\n‚ÄòWhat if I make Christmas lunch and you can do the tree?‚Äô He said.\n‚ÄòNo, I‚Äôm already doing lunch,‚Äô she said, then in English: ‚ÄòPitch in, that‚Äôs how we all do it here.‚Äô\nShe got up and shuffled her feet into slippers and sat next to him.\n‚ÄòDid you invite Ayn?‚Äô\n‚ÄòI haven‚Äôt, yet,‚Äô he said, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs been a busy week.

I like her too.‚Äô\nAs Tzipora worked her way into a Christmas fever, he began to like it too. She was better when she was happier ‚Äî she smiled more, and the compulsion to pull her shirt or rub her nose abated. It was very strange to see a girl he‚Äôd known as old before her time suddenly revert five years and adopt a flurry of youth; it was a childish rekindling of the good things in her that might be more accessible if she‚Äôd grown up in her home country. He was suckered into the season‚Äôs festivities too, a holiday empty in the country of plenty without faith and family. He even attended a mass at Tzipora‚Äôs request ‚Äî she was still deicidal, but she remained a Catholic and wanted to be a part of the fun.\nOn Christmas Eve Tzipora had put herself to sleep with sickly Winter wine and had curled up on the couch. Ayn sat with Baron at the table and they finished what was left of the bottle as the evening rolled on. He‚Äôd lost the nose but still had antlers. She was in a Santa hat and sweet with good cheer.\n‚ÄòIt‚Äôs funny, when you think about it,‚Äô she said. Her smile had become small and serious. ‚ÄòIt all turned out well enough, didn‚Äôt it?‚Äô\n‚ÄòIt‚Äôs hardly started,‚Äô he smirked, and gestured with his thumb at the girl on the couch. His voice was very low as to not wake the girl. ‚ÄòShe‚Äôs got a whole thing planned. She doesn‚Äôt want me to know what it is. She‚Äôll happily let me clean up her wrapping paper and wash the dishes, but she won‚Äôt tell me what‚Äôs going on. She‚Äôs got something in the oven, that‚Äôs all I know.‚Äô\n‚ÄòMmhmm,‚Äô she said, and she stretched out a hand and gently laid it across his. ‚ÄòBut I mean in the scheme of things, Baron. I meant in general.‚Äô\n‚ÄòLike how?‚Äô\n‚ÄòWell, you and I could never marry. And I could never have a baby, you know that. I always wanted a child,‚Äô she said. She squeezed his hand. ‚ÄòBut here we are, anyway.

The Ramoin-Dupont H700A ‚ÄúCosmojet‚Äù series are the primary carrier-based fighters of Vekllei. They‚Äôre a real bitch to fly. Beloved as they are iconic, variations of the Cosmojet (H600A, B, H500A, etc.) make up the bulk of Vekllei‚Äôs total fighter outfit. Unconventional inverted gull wings and embedded turbofan engines make for a striking and uniquely Vekllei aircraft.\nAnd that was the whole point. The first Ramoin-Dupont fighter was always about more than military prestige ‚Äî it would signal to the world that Vekllei was more than a backwards trough of hamlets and cities. The RD H-series would be an all-nuclear, all-Vekllei fighter. The country had been left scorched by the nuclear exchange at the turn of the millennium. The collapse of the old regime brought about widespread poverty and backwardness. The United States and Europe had emerged with industry mostly intact, and their governments were bankrolling nuclear aircraft programmes. So Vekllei began tentative research into modernising its ageing air force.\nThe Ramoin-Dupont Aircraft Company was founded by the two cities of its namesake in the cooperative economic boom of the 2010s and 2020s, and the initial development factory and test fields were outdated and burdened by a catalogue of old-fashioned turbojet transport aircraft. The handful of genius engineers in the RD skunkworks set to work, in collaboration with General Reactor, on the new fighter project. As progress was made, the pressure to catch up was eclipsed by excitement as key technological breakthroughs offered Vekllei a chance at leapfrogging conventional military fighters and ushering in a new aluminium-body nuclear fighter. Most crucial were the advancements in Vekllei domestic reactor technology, brought about by General Reactor. Sunburst-style heat exchangers meant lower reactor temps, which allowed for lighter chromium-cadmium shielding and an overall weight reduction of several thousand pounds compared to American and European projects.\nAfter two decades of development, the result was the Aurora. It was still too heavy to properly arm because of the shielding and size requirements of a molten salt reactor. Succeeding generations corrected critical flaws in power management, manoeuvrability, and weight. Fifty years later, the Cosmojet is a direct descendent of that project and stands as the 15th iteration in the nuclear jet programme overall.\n The aircraft pictured is named ‚ÄúLola,‚Äù a common girls name in the country. Her nose and forward air intake are painted like a puffin‚Äôs break, the national bird. The Vekllei roundel features the logographic character for ‚Äòland of volcanoes,‚Äô the masculine glossary‚Äôs (Loh) hieroglyph for Vekllei. The paint on her vertical stabiliser marks her as the second fighter of her squadron.\n The nuclear reactor makes the fighter extraordinarily heavy, and despite three powerful engines and an inverse-gull delta wing, the aircraft is most commonly launched by catapult systems, even on land. The indirect air cycle system limits radioactive pollution of the surrounding material and the cockpit is only lightly shielded. Although the reactor saves many thousands of tonnes of jet fuel over the course of its lifetime, day-to-day operations of any carrier fighter require manoeuvrability and reliability. To save weight, the Cosmojet carries only enough chemical fuel for controlled descent using the auxiliary lightweight chemical combustion engine. Her two auxiliary exhausts swivel with the primary flaps, allowing the heavy jet to slow for approach. The iconic inverse-gull wing reduces the strain on landing gear and saves weight by removing the need for fortified (and heavy) landing gear. It also allows for heavy torpedoes to be mounted on the fuselage, which are designed primarily for use against nuclear submarines.\nThe Cosmojet uses a 2.5MW air-cooled molten salt reactor with an indirect air cycle system powering one chemical-reactor hybrid electric turbofan and two auxiliary segregated turbofans mounted in the wings. The reactor heats liquid metal, which is circulated in radiators by turbopumps and heats air drawn in through the wing and forward intakes. The air is then pumped back into the engines and expelled through one of three exhausts at the rear of the aircraft. In addition, the Cosmojet uses a small chemical combustion engine for take-off and landing and for auxiliary power in the event of reactor malfunction or the EMP effects of a nuclear weapon. The prohibitively strict weight limit means that the Cosmojet only carries enough fuel for take-off and landing.\nVekllei employs nearly 4,000 Cosmojet-series fighters today. All of them are used as supersonic air-superiority fighters. As an island nation with a defensive military posture and a fear of nuclear war, this enormous expenditure is supposed to show results in a global nuclear exchange, much of which will still be delivered by supersonic jet bombers.\nIf you have any questions or want to interrogate my (limited) aircraft knowledge, go ham!

Between the atomic fire that ruined the city, and the death of the king, there was a time when the city of Vekllei once resembled its lifeless lava fields to the North. In the communities that gathered themselves in the shadow of holocaust, common agriculture like fruits and berries returned to the city in what they call¬†koka parkland.\nKoka is the Vekllei word for forest (ka), combined with a prefixtual particle that ‚Äòindustrialises‚Äô it. It is usually translated as ‚Äòmunicipal forest‚Äô, and was designed for and continues to serve two purposes in the city today.\nThe first is that consumable raw agricultural products, like fruits, nuts and berries, were valuable commodity in the starving post-war neighbourhoods that emerged in the ruins of the old city. These foods were combined with bread and meat, staples of the Vekllei diet, to give flavour in a country without easy access to spices and salt. By integrating them into common gardens, the people of Vekllei returned the production of food into a common, shared space that predicated the wider decommodification of the country. To this day, very little fruit is distributed through grocers; it is grown freely and year-round in¬†koka parks in the city.\nThe second is that¬†Upen, the animistic spiritualism that guides most of Vekllei culture, blossomed in the ashes of the monarchy and revived a real desire to desegregate spirits from urban life. The construction of massive¬†koka parks, filled with food and old trees and free-flowing water, offered an apology to the spirits driven out by industry and agriculture, and invited them to return to human settlement as fellow custodians of the earth. Many¬†koka parks house temples for dialogue with spirits and sprites, and they bless the surrounding neighbourhoods.\nTo step into a koka¬†park is to disappear from the urban world. Birds warble, leaves whisper to themselves and water trickles sweetly through bright mosses. The largest parks hide the surrounding skyline entirely, and disappear tourists for hours at a time, only to spit them out hours later, confused and exhausted. Any piece of infrastructure, any human touch, is strangled with banners and wires suspending pennants. In keeping with Vekllei Semaphore, a separate language from¬†upotenne¬†and written Vekllei, the flags themselves speak to visitors through their colour, direction and shape. The effect of being swallowed by a¬†koka park is detoxifying and luxurious ‚Äî and by the time your lunch break has ended, you are fed and at peace.\n-\u0026ndash;\nIf you have any questions, let me know!

Once her lover had left her, and her presence began to irritate the small group, she left one night and walked to the local Women‚Äôs Auxiliary, a barracks of women and girls supporting the marxist stooges in that part of Nevada. It was impressive to the fourteen year-old ‚Äî the dusty desert outpost was flush with Soviet-made rifles and medicine, with rations aplenty. As she enlisted, she thought of her abandoned comrades. She was filled with anger and jealousy.\nShe told her garrison leader, a man with an accent from somewhere on the East Coast she couldn‚Äôt quite place, about how she and her skilled anarchist friends had been at waging guerilla war against the secessionists. Then, in an act of spite, she mentioned that her old comrades had stolen supplies from an Worker\u0026rsquo;s Reunification Party camp. Perhaps, in her silly little head, she had wanted to see them brought under control and disciplined, and she would finally be satisfied after their cruel words and coldness.\nMichael and Lenny, two friends, leaders, and one an ex-lover, were picked up by a WRP patrol and shot in the head in their prison cells.

About half of Vekllei kids go through the \u0026lsquo;Blossom\u0026rsquo; network of youth orgs at some point in their lives. Yeah, youth groups are popular nowadays. The Boy Scouts and Girl Guides of the United States are as mandatory as schooling in some states, and various Red Pioneers around the world test orthodoxy in Soviet and Red Chinese children.\nThe Girl Guides of the U.S. now boast catalogues of several hundred pages, selling thousands of Guides-branded items to their own members and Guide-friendly suburbs. Outwardly, the cartoons of Heinz and Carpenter (both of Western Family Magazine fame) might show off Guides assembling tents in jigger jackets and bright sashes, but they always seemed to neglect the impoverished girls priced out of the Guides organisation, like was so common at the time. There were a lot of poor girls in America by 2083.\nThings are not much better for the Boy Scouts, who are only a few lethal armaments away from becoming paramilitary. They worship the flag and guard America‚Äôs character. Following the catastrophic Sino-American nuclear exchange, the Boy Scouts were enlisted in Civil Defense, an order that would kill many times more boys than the bombs ever did. You had kids being killed protecting grocers in food riots, and disappearing en masse as the cities collapsed. It was absurd.\nSo in the search for an analogue to Vekllei‚Äôs Blossoms, do we have any choice but to look to the Pioneers of those miserable countries of the East? After all, Vekllei has no money to spend, and no flag to worship (the domestic standard is a simple red rectangle, the international standard is decorated). Perhaps the Blossoms, a relatively decentralised organisation for a youth group, has no real comparison in the world today.\n Boys and girls of schooling age can join unisex troops\n (the literal translation of the word is ‚Äòbarracks‚Äô, but in Vekllei it lacks the military connotation)\n and they will receive a uniform of wool, lisle cotton and nylon blended advanced fabrics. On their person they carry binoculars, twine, and tools of various utility. On hikes they often carry air rifles for small game hunts; most every Blossom will learn the basics of gun safety and shooting at some point.\n The real emphasis of the Blossom network is in the naturalist spiritualism of the country, or Upen. Blossoms are taught about agriculture, food production and consumption in their society. Most troops enforce ‚Äòcatch-kill‚Äô rules: if a troop member wants to eat meat, they should kill, skin, and clean the animal to illustrate the relationship between consumption and exploitation. Environmentalism in the organisation is broad and humancentric. Although environmental science and the geology of the country is taught, most camps place emphasis on rural infrastructure, roupoismentet (or \u0026lsquo;local living\u0026rsquo;, a word for agrarian communities), and the place of spirits in Vekllei‚Äôs domestic affairs. This is not to portray Vekllei as an overly vegetarian or sentimental country \u0026ndash; just that Upen is a part of life for Vekllei children, and contributes to their understanding of the world.\nMany Blossoms pursue employment in the Armed Forces upon leaving school, as a natural extension of the organised lifestyle of a youth org. This is not to say that life in the Blossoms is particularly militaristic \u0026ndash; Vekllei does not actually have professional culture, despite hierarchies, and so life in the Blossoms is casual fair, and like the rest of the country, largely individualistic and self-satisfying. Boys and girls go on camps, eat food out of a can, sleep under the stars, collect badges, fall in and out of puppy love, learn to assemble a rifle, meet wild animals, etc.\n Tzipora perches on a tree stump as her friend rushes to steady the camera. She surveys her domain. The flower-tundra from here to Montre was uninhabited. Society had been stripped away and they were fellow creatures of the forest.

Upen is the animistic religion of Vekllei. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have priests, but it has ceremony, and it shapes every part of the country today. From apartment cooperatives to the types of cotton used in clothing, Upen has extraordinary reach for an ostensibly agnostic and secular country.\nIt works out that way because Upen is not an organised religion, and resembles more closely a collective spiritualism with supernatural beliefs. It is not incompatible with theism, a quirk we\u0026rsquo;ll explore below, but it manifests outside of churches in the passing of seasons, code of dress and rural egalitarianism.\nHow exactly a person goes about their animism is their business, and depends on personal faith. Most Vekllei people are atheistic and believe there is another plane of existence which houses their ancestors, spirits, sprites, and demons. This is reflected in how they see the world:\n ‚ÄãUpen, as atheistic and animistic, shelters the landscape from becoming ‚Äòsimply nature‚Äô, as it does when viewed as a product of a monotheistic creator god. To these people, agnostic of \u0026lsquo;landscape\u0026rsquo;, nature is not ‚Äòsimply nature‚Äô; it is a spiritual vessel in itself, inalienable and inextricably linked to human purpose and satisfaction. Industry is divorced from the whole concept; it is a country of forest commons, collective stewardship, and volcanic unrest.\n It is not always easy to reconcile the basic assumptions Upen makes about the world. Viewed through Tzipora‚Äôs nonpracticing Roman Catholic lens, the mess of her religious beliefs look something like this:\n There is a single creator God, who took on man‚Äôs flesh as Christ. He\n (and in her mind, it is most certainly a He)\n is not omnibenevolent or even totally omniscient. Humans, as weak and mortal, must obey Him until they have the power to usurp Him. He is a guiding force of the world. Spirits, as physical manifestations of the landscape, are fellow travelers on this planet and should always be treated with respect, as humans are guests. With a fragile, physical form, it is a uniquely human burden to cultivate and protect the land, and actualise their purpose as a species.\n So, to dissect her version of Upen, we have here four (five) different characters in the spiritual world:\nFirst are spirits and sprites, which are the souls and fabric of the forests and hills. They are as old as the Earth itself and predate humans by billions of years, a fact that seems implied when you are joined in physical presence with them. They treasure, and indeed, embody the Earth and can reap wealth or chaos among us. Spirits take many forms, sometimes anthropomorphic, sometimes only partially corporeal. This one here has collected jewellery, gold, and peratin leaves, as they are fiercely attracted to precious metals. Just as we dress up for them, peaceful spirits will dress up for us and mimic parts of our bodies. Sprites (as opposed to spirits) are smaller, more emotional, and are fragments of reproduction \u0026ndash; think of them like spores of ferns, of the pollen of flowers. You can see a small one floating beside the spirit.\nChrist was the first and only time that God is recorded to have walked among the living. He might visit the spirit world often; Tzipora wouldn‚Äôt know. As a creator and guide for humans, He was born as a human and taught ways to live well. Humanity is very young and is still learning to live on the Earth. The ritual of communion is a way of reminding us that We are in His image, and We are unworthy. He died for our sins; sins Tzipora is very sure will eventually usurp Him altogether in whatever deicidal sci-fi utopia she\u0026rsquo;s got going on in her head.\nThen, there are humans themselves. Here, Tzipora is in full costume designed for religious ceremony to talk to spirits. You can read more about the costume here. She might ask for rains, or a long summer, or for the forest to return a missing child. Food offerings are presented. She forms a whole rune with her body as part of Upotenne, or the language of spirits. Upotenne itself is an ancient type of Potenne, which is modern Vekllei sign language. This is a calming rune, indicating maternal affection, and you can see the written hieroglyph appears visually similar to the pose.\nFinally, demons walk the Earth and can manifest in many different ways. This one has taken the form of a girl, and carries the severed head of a goat. Its eyelids are painted with ritualistic eyes in mockery of proper funeral rites. They often wander aimlessly through uninhabited areas, as noise in intolerable to most demons. They are mysterious creatures, and their purpose is unknown. They come from the place spirits go to die. Like apex predators, they wander aimlessly and without purpose, hunting and feeding at random. They are feeble in physical forms, with one exception: they can form physical runes quickly and maliciously. The one cast here is an omen of suffering (translated literally as \u0026lsquo;harpoiseanin\u0026rsquo;, or overpowering the body with its own stomach acids). In Vekllei, a \u0026lsquo;demon\u0026rsquo; is any biplanar or otherwise supernatural creature that takes corporeal form and harms folk directly. Spirits can maim and kill, but only through the forces of nature \u0026ndash; a demon attacks physically. There are many types of demons, and you can read more about them here.\nIf you have any questions about Upen, just ask.

Thanks for stopping by!\n-\u0026ndash;\nPost scriptum: Upen is also the reason Vekllei does not recognise either private or public property, and was actually the inspiration for making this post. Although many people exert \u0026lsquo;ownership\u0026rsquo;, the concept of property as something other than \u0026lsquo;nature\u0026rsquo; is not recognised, and so society in Vekllei remains thoroughly decommodified. Looking at Vekllei through the lens of Upen, it becomes clear that a moneyless domestic economy is not the product of grand secular collectivist ideals but a natural extension of egalitarian environmentalism; essentially urbanised agrarian socialism.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2018-10-30-steward/","title":"The Stewards of the Earth"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article predates the project, and should be considered non-canon.  Unlike the United States and Western Europe, the ‚Äòteen-ager‚Äô has not been discovered in Vekllei. To be pedantic, they do technically exist ‚Äî their people do indeed enter a transitory stage between childhood and adulthood, as far as anyone can tell ‚Äî but they do not exist as a separate cultural identity. The teen-age person in Vekllei is immersed in adult economic and social relationships, and so they have no real cultural material of their own. They listen to the music of their parents, raise younger siblings, and generally marry young. I could go on for a while about things Vekllei has not ‚Äòdiscovered‚Äô (read: commodified through modernity); landscape, childhood, history, etc. But let‚Äôs stick with teen-agers for now.\nBy sexual maturation, a Vekllei person has essentially transitioned to young-adulthood and submerged themselves in the productive relations of the adult age; they often leave school for work, they quickly drift to mature, independent relationships with parents, and otherwise carve out lives in their wondrous country. All of this is not to say that the country lacks materials aimed at young people entirely ‚Äî you can‚Äôt fit a middle-aged woman into a sixteen-year-old‚Äôs dress, no matter how much she might try ‚Äî but I am simply trying to establish an understanding that folk here do not enjoy the glamour (or what was once glamour) of American teen-agers, with sock-hops and convertible cars and magazines.\nTangentially related, as Vekllei society has militarised in the face of nuclear war, so too has fashion adopted a bayonet‚Äôs edge. In womens fashion, we‚Äôre seeing the reemergence of ‚Äòdazzle‚Äô camouflage in imitation of her great capital ships. Jackets, skirts, jewellery, hats, are all being manufactured in flavours of it, and are often touspian or ‚Äòpastelised‚Äô into designs and colours considered more feminine. In men, military caps and ties are popular in semiformal social outfits, and often complement suits. The country is already heavily uniformed in the workplace, and has a passion for badges and armbands and decorative knick-knacks, and so a lot of these authoritative trinkets are trickling into everyday fashion.\nIt‚Äôs easy to despair at the militarisation of society, and a warhawk fashion culture, but it could also be seen as a critical modernist/postmodern attack on the traditional institutions that are so integral to life and culture in Vekllei society. In sharp dresses women wear armbands embroidered with brands of soup, men wear faux-military badges displaying ridiculous illustrations ‚Äî while not outright political perhaps, they are certainly appropriating the imagery of war and domesticating it.\n Tzipora here is sixteen, waiting for a first date, and patterned with the dazzle of the Sundress nuclear-equipped capital ship.\n I haven‚Äôt really felt out my thoughts fully on the subject of teen-age life and its introduction to Western society, so if ya got any ideas leave a comment. I‚Äôm also building a website, www.vekllei.city, but it‚Äôs a bit shit at the moment.

In October of 2074, the Ford Motor Company was embroiled in political catastrophe after Vermont senator Henry Walsh accused unionism in its East-Coast plants of traitorism by allowing foreign spies to acquire jobs in the Company. Whether the spies were Soviet or Chinese changed several times in Walsh‚Äôs accusations, but the claims themselves were not entirely unfounded. An investigation by the FBI received by congress found that several high-ranking Auto Workers Union members in Ford plants had connections to communist organisations, which were then discovered to have smuggled foreign agents into the country.\nThe recognition of Ford as a traitorous company, combined with an ailing combustion-engine automobile catalogue, sank the company into receivership and then bankruptcy. In a few short weeks, the titan of American industry, and the grandfather of mass-production, had ceased to exist except in name (which was acquired by Chrysler and branded tokenistically on several models of Chrysler vehicles).\nForty-thousand jobs disappeared by the new year. The economy was bad and the plants of the company were unsold and were bleached by the sun. The Southern states, which had served as primary hubs of the auto industry after Detroit‚Äôs collapse a decade before, saw unemployment jump ten percent. Is it any surprise what followed?\nIt would be misleading to categorise everything that has happened since as a consequence of the Ford Motor Company‚Äôs collapse, but in the minds of most Americans ‚Äî and most importantly, blue-collar men of the Southern States ‚Äî it was the beginning of the end for the Union, and the secession of the Southern States from the United States four years later had rolled off the back of the economic collapse spurred by Ford.\nHungry and anguished by economic collapse, and increasing fragmentation of Southern culture as cities, companies and universities diversified culturally, Southerners found conspiracy in many sectors of modern American life. There were Jews, who controlled big money in the East Coast cities and relished the South\u0026rsquo;s failures. There were capitalists, who were often conflated with Jews as enemies of the noble small business community. There was the Federal Government itself, and a cabal of socialists, communists and leftists who had wrought their jealousy upon the south. And there were blacks and hispanics, who were brothers in victimhood or conspirators depending on what county you were in.\nAlthough the South would gain some measure of independence after the heat of the fighting had tapered out, the Southern States would never fully recover, and both the secessionist and Union states continued to maintain a single U.S. military.\nIf you have any questions, let me know!

From preschool to university and beyond, all students wear a variant of the same uniform. The kindergartners may not wear a full gi and camisole pinafore, but the basic ensemble is still there. This is the girl‚Äôs one, and it‚Äôs much more elaborate than the boy‚Äôs uniform.\nYear-round, all students wear a school armband with their year and class embroidered on it and a badge of education, which is pinned to the top button. Girls wear a selection of other traditional items.\nThe gi is a ceremonial quarter-pleat worn by schoolgirls and the wider public generally. It is usually embroidered for the festival month it was made in, and many Vekllei girls have several gi for different celebratory months (birth month, blood month, shipbuilder‚Äôs month, etc). In summer it is also common to wear a sun petticoat, a delicate lace petticoat worn exposed beneath the hem of the skirt. These are often handmade. Traditionally hair is pulled into a fountain hairpiece if it is long enough, and can accompany temple hairpieces as well. These hairstyles trace back to the spirit priestesses and have become fashionable again.\nIn winter, both boys and girls wear a half cape for Vekllei‚Äôs miserable winter months. These are usually wool and lined with insulating materials. Girls also wear a camisole pinafore, which is essentially a traditional girl‚Äôs camisole that is tucked into the skirt to make a dress for the winter months.\nArmbands, badges, half capes and gi are worn in many other industries as well, since nearly every company employs a uniformed staff. It is common for a girl to hold a gi from her middle-school years, where it is oversized and clumsy, all the way to graduation and then employment.\nFor those wondering what happens to valuable metals and gemstones in a moneyless society like Vekllei, you simply have to look a little closer ‚Äî they are often sewn into badges and ceremonial clothes. Stripped of their commodity, they have become precious and sacred items that bejewel important objects. The badge of education, for example, contains a ruby in its heart.\nNone of this stops roughhousing, and Tzipora‚Äôs just beat the shit out of a girl who called her a lesbian.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2018-09-25-uniforms/","title":"School uniforms for girls"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article predates the project, and should be considered non-canon.  A single hiss, the heavy door rolls back, and it derails into sandbags.

The larger cities, swollen with people, are protected by antimissile laser batteries. But China is very big, and there are not enough lasers, nor enough power, to shield the entire country from missiles. This missile will extinguish 42,000 people instantly, in a ball of hot fire, and kill anywhere from 250-750,000 moments after as the city is ripped up like paper. Along with other missiles from the U.S., Vekllei, and Europe, this missile will irradiate the Yangtze and set fire to great swaths of farmland. Lanzhou will be a crater, her neighbouring villages will be on fire, and the scraps of her people that survive will drift elsewhere, this land scorched. Famine will set in, radiation will poison her children and ensure that future generations living in the great land that was once China will be primitive and factional for hundreds of years.\nThe Chinese, too, will do good work destroying America. Where missiles are zapped out of the sky, bombs are sent into freefall from jets, and they erase the heart and culture of American cities and industry.\nBy the end of it, three hours later, 1.4 billion people will be dead or taken ill, ash will rain from the sky as huge fragments of earth cycle across the Northern Hemisphere‚Äôs atmosphere, and the thyroids of the global youth will get to work soaking up radiation in the vast wastes of North America and East Asia.\nVekllei, as it had always known it would, emerged flustered and unharmed. It had lost 23,000 people to bombs, one in the city and one near Montre, but her food stock was secure, her population was underground, and so her diplomats set to work resuscitating the U.N. and organising relief to the globe.

There are some comics that Vekllei syndicates just won‚Äôt publish. KID Magazine, or KID Comix ran for nearly a century. It was picked up and dropped by dozens of anonymous artists, writers and editors, all operating under nonsense pseudonyms ‚Äî Red, Squick, Failson and Daddy Fun were some of the longest-serving. It would go out of print for years, until some contributing artist would revive the mailing list and recruit new editors and writers. Not even editors knew the names of their team ‚Äî and so KID became a rag-tag, pornographic, angry, satire comic published anonymously anywhere from biannually to a dozen times a year and distributed through universities, underground comics syndicates and workplaces. A single copy might be repressed dozens of times and redistributed further, making original copies collector‚Äôs items.\nIssue 36 blasted Vekllei munitions trade with the United States, which was by this point gripped by economic collapse as the industrial centres of the South were levelled by poverty and fighting.\n The comic is not subtle: a stereotypical Vekllei girl complete with gi and fountain hairpiece offers an artillery shell to a deformed pigman soldier carrying the U.S. flag and an atom bomb. The girl wears the national flower on her apron. The pigman sits atop a throne of food and corpses, as he himself decomposes.

Just a few notes on what it means to be a man in Vekllei.\nVekllei is a country at odds with itself. On one hand, it is universal in its politics and fundamentally internationalist; on the other it is a deeply traditional country that values bloodlines and heritage. It is a secular democracy that regularly alludes to monarchy in its rituals and symbolism. It is a culture that is so casual it offends foreign visitors while retaining strict codes of conduct.\nVekllei is unique in that it is one of few Western countries with strong matriarchal tendencies. As part of petticoat feminism, it explicitly states as such: the default disposition of the human race is ‚Äòfemale‚Äô. That is not to say that men are robbed of masculinity or women are stripped of their femininity ‚Äî both roles in Vekllei society have pervasive roles and stereotypes, and are lived out every day by millions of people. Instead, it means that over the course of hundreds of years, and the inevitable triumph of Vekllei over whatever those years will bring, ‚Äòman‚Äô as a concept will cease to exist. After all, femininity has nearly absorbed all masculine traits in Vekllei already ‚Äî warrior culture, casual mateship, profanity and drinking, etc. Petticoat feminism, and by some extent petticoat socialism, understand masculine figures as an economic and social product of a previous age, and consequently, to co-opt some business newspaper slogan, ‚Äúthe future is female‚Äù. As the economy is revolutionised, and the country is rebuilt over and over again, so too will it leave behind the economic products of ‚Äúold society‚Äù, a phrase that in Vekllei has very specific connotations (namely, the years of monarchy followed by authoritarianism).\nTzipora‚Äôs father is a man‚Äôs man. He is a product of a dying generation. He wears his pants too high, the fit of his suits are loose, and he has spent his life in authority, surrounded by critical decisions that require his attention. Yet even he carries in his heart petticoat culture ‚Äî he has raised two daughters, and they have ‚Äòfeminised‚Äô him, in a sense ‚Äî not in a way that makes him ‚Äòweak‚Äô or ‚Äòemasculate‚Äô, but in his ability to interact with wider petticoat society.\nI‚Äôll close with a letter from his oldest daughter, on the subject of Tzipora and her relationship with her dad:\n He‚Äôs a good father, and a good man ‚Äî an excellent man, in his later years. He‚Äôs a hard worker and radiates masculine authority, like many of his generation, but he was also forced into progressivism by the fact that his entire family at the end of his life were women. A man like that can‚Äôt choose to be picky about what he does and doesn‚Äôt hear concerning the personal and biological intricacies of womanhood. And this girl, this little Montre chickette he is telephoning, was the worst of them all! Thank God he was an affectionate father to her, even more so than he was to me, because the things she would tell him about! Her suspected lesbianism, her flirtations with bolshevism, and that‚Äôs not to mention the difficulty she had making friends at school, a wound that she scarcely hid from him. Yes, this man was all she had! Girls like me, good blood daughters, we have our women. Zelda, bless her, had him.

A fluorescent light burst on Thursday. She was stacking cans for a display. The girl was working alone that evening and leaving her mark everywhere ‚Äî happy apple drawings, new posters, displays ‚Äî she liked the job.\nThe light burst like a gunshot and she leapt to her feet. Down the aisle she saw herself, at the lowest point in her life, standing over an old friend. To say she had shot him would be misleading ‚Äî she had executed him, point-blank. He was bleeding into the sandwiches with flaps of skin stirring weakly on the back of his head.\nThe store evaporated and the girl was back in Cherry, Nevada. He was trying to leave in the middle of the night. She‚Äôd followed him and confronted him. She‚Äôd asked the same question over and over as she had held the gun out. ‚ÄòAre you going to the Soviets?‚Äô\nHe told her he was hoping to secure armaments for the Wolves, and that with clean clothes and Soviet support they could launch bigger things ‚Äî better things. Ambushes, bombings, even assist the Militias in real rebellion.\nHe was lying, of course. He was going to the Soviets because the anarchists were all dead, and he would be too if he didn‚Äôt run. That was enough for her. She didn‚Äôt shoot him for lying. She shot him for desertion.\nThe memory had ruined her life, and here it was, triggered by one of so many things that reminded her of that time in the desert. When she was back in the supermarket, sweating like a pig, she picked up the can she‚Äôd dropped and went back to work.\nIt was all exaggerated in her head. The boy had covered half the aisle in blood! That wasn‚Äôt how the whole thing went down. In the desert she‚Äôd shot him from a few feet back, and there had been a red mist but it didn‚Äôt touch her. He didn‚Äôt splatter none. He went into the ground and bounced off it, kicking as his whole body went haywire, before he went still on the ground. The back of his head spurted once, like a man pissing nervous, and then it bubbled and trickled out of the hole in his head like a drinking fountain as he set to work emptying as many of his litres as he could manage before his organs died. The blood didn‚Äôt fucking shine on tiled floors, either. It soaked into the desert. When they moved him, a sweet rose of colour was in the heart of it, red in the sand, but the wide stain was damp and grey and innocent.\nShe didn‚Äôt sleep much that week, goes without saying.\n The following concerns Vekllei‚Äôs domestic economy, fair warning.\nSupermarkets are relatively rare in Vekllei, especially compared to the States. Like many command economies, Vekllei‚Äôs internal economy requires total employment. Supermarkets are too automated, and so distribution is usually decentralised among many smaller grocers that can be found on nearly every street. These are what we would consider private enterprises, although Vekllei does not make a distinction between public and private.\n Senrouive types of workplaces are distinct from Venrouiva as private or personal business. This is not the same as ‚Äòprivate‚Äô property, as we understand it. Vekllei does not actually make any distinction of property ‚Äî everything belongs to the land, including the country. Vekllei does not use money, either. Instead, anything self-operating and nonessential to the operation of the country is Senrouive. Restaurants, cinemas, department stores, etc.\n So despite the fact that Vekllei does not use money, grocers benefit from having first pick of goods. There are no real shortages of essential foods in Vekllei, but seasonal and otherwise special produce ‚Äî like that made for festivals or imported from abroad ‚Äî are often in short supply. If you like your food, being a grocer is a good place to start. Occasionally it can also be difficult to obtain special types of ordinary produce ‚Äî flavoured ham or fruit yogurts, for example.\n‚ÄòFirst pick‚Äô is less a gift of the economy to Grocers than it is just a natural conclusion of Vekllei‚Äôs moneyless system. Tzipora works at only fourteen, not because she needs spending money or because she wants to climb a food-prep or managerial ladder, but because she‚Äôs bored and wearing an apron and badge gives her a small sense of importance, even if she only impresses the handful of regulars that stop by. There is no real value in professionalism in Vekllei, so work hours are very casual and many business close frequently for lunch, afternoon tea, and pre-closing celebration. Most shopkeeps will only give you a passing nod from behind from their paperback when you enter a store.\nAt first glance, Vekllei‚Äôs shelves look like that of any other Western country, but the actual purpose of advertising and posters are pure theatrics ‚Äî they are superficial imitations of an American supermarket with all its colour and splendour ‚Äî the entire purpose of advertising goods it so soak up work-hours of some marketing graduate on his way to bigger and better things. The labels on the cans are just labels.\nIf you have any questions, please ask!

Policing is always difficult in utopian planning.

That‚Äôs not something I‚Äôll be talking about today.\nThe Vekllei Constabulary are the second largest policing body in the country, after conventional police.\nBusiness and manufacturing are divided into two arenas in Vekllei:\n Venrouiva: administrative, governmental and national facilities of essential function. Technically, anything under command of the bodies that form national direction (government, legislature, judiciary, etc.) are part of the Venrouiva. This is similar to what we think of nationalised institutions in our countries, but also includes essential industries like electricity and education.\nSenrouive: is distinct from Venrouiva as private or personal business. This is not the same as ‚Äòprivate‚Äô property, as we understand it. Vekllei does not actually make any distinction of property ‚Äî everything belongs to the land, including the country. Vekllei does not use money, either. Instead, anything self-operating and nonessential to the operation of the country is Senrouive. Restaurants, cinemas, department stores, etc.\n The Constabulary are the police force responsible for responding to, patrolling, and protecting Venrouiva business in the country. They are general protection for all seats of power, military assets, power stations, libraries, hospitals, places of worship, national monuments, schools, etc.\nTheir distinctive uniform is handed down from their years as a rifle-equipped military police. They wear a dark half-cape, white Sam Browne belt, leather gloves and a ceremonial sword from Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s years of monarchy. Women often wear a skirt with a gi quarter-pleat also found in civilian Vekllei clothes and uniforms, as well as a cap. The uniform changes depending on the season and purpose of their duty.\nUnlike regular police, which are mostly disarmed in Vekllei, Constabulary always carry pistols, and often submachine guns. While they do not make house calls, you will see them establish checkpoints and escort protests. Keep an eye out for them next time you‚Äôre there.\nLet me know if you have any questions!

The single most important function of today‚Äôs global powers is not in the numbers of men at a state\u0026rsquo;s command, or the prosperity of their domestic markets, but the ability to project power across the world entire.\nWe have seen this manifest in many ways; ICBMs are just one example. Warfare in a modern context has become a highly intelligent and specialised force that has simultaneously limited the brutality of warmongering while amplifying the ruthlessness and political function of state-sponsored murder.\n In Vekllei, there is no real distinction between the intelligence services and the military, although the latter is almost always subservient to the former. Just as agents are armed as terrorists, soldiers are equipped as spies.\n This all-female sniper company is world-renowned, thanks to the film Beyond These Shores. Like agents of espionage, every woman of this company will spend her entire military age in the cauldron of war, in a cycle of training and international operations that keep their bayonets sharp. They are not coloured by romanticism ‚Äî on one hand, they can function as a noble skilled partisan in defense of the Vekllei home country. On the other, they are also employed with the secret services to commit acts of terrorism and fratricide. They wear tattered red armbands in camaraderie with their ancestors before them.

There is no real distinction between the city of Vekllei and the state of Vekllei, at least internally. To them, the country and the city are the same, and the isolated population centres of Montre and Adouisneh are simply distant neighbourhoods. This is reflected in all manners of life ‚Äî they are ethnically and culturally homogenous, patriotic, and largely uncompetitive. They are a single people numbering 20 million, living in the shadow of igneous monument and lush, fertile lands.\nIn the south, where warm winds from the Azores sweep across the beaches of black sand, the climate is temperate and a great many of Vekllei‚Äôs most renowned wonders are accessible. Geysers, the tectonic fault, volcanoes and hot springs are scattered across the outskirts of Vekllei.\nHeading north, the cold weather thins large-leaf forests and it is here that her signature landscape is found in abundance ‚Äî the ro, or flower-tundra, can be hundreds of kilometres wide and populated entirely by flowers, ringed by sharp mountains forced into peaks by the violent forces of the earth below. Vekllei has the most flowers per capita out of any country in the world.\nOn this map, which is cartoonish and exaggerated, you can see several landmarks ‚Äî Vekllei‚Äôs largest volcano (Durtoneis, or Fire of the Earth), the expansive lava fields to the North, and Vekllei‚Äôs food basket, which runs between the ro highlands and the fault line. Only Vekllei‚Äôs massive glaciers, which give the country the cleanest drinking water in the world, are in permafrost.\n Look at this ‚Äî! Look at this place, where the horizon meets the sky without a stitch! Listen to the water, rich and sweet with soil, trickle through the ro. What a place this is‚Ä¶ If she‚Äôd had any respect for God, she would have marvelled at the beauty of His ro. If she‚Äôd thought He was good and decent, she would have thanked Him for constructing such a place for her. But the truth of it, at least in her mind, was that God may be the creator, but the beauty of this ro is in the hands of humans, now. This place is the territory of Vekllei, in all her glory.

Gregori Hordiyenko, the little Ukrainian boy whose namesake was adopted by his disease, died age 27 in a car accident. Many others of the \u0026ldquo;first dozen\u0026rdquo; committed suicide, were killed by disease, died from complications arising from the genetic function of the syndrome, and a disproportionate number were born into the third world, where they were eliminated by famine, displacement or superstition.\nTzipora Desmoines, Vekllei‚Äôs first and only Gregori baby, was born in 2063. By the time of her LIFE interview, she was sixty-two years old. Yet she remains as she was on the eve of her menarche ‚Äî fourteen, prepubescent, and largely miserable.\nWhen you meet her for the first time, you have no idea how to talk to her. Is she a young teen-ager, or a sixty year old woman? A lot of her patient and soft-spoken quality is misinterpreted as a product of age, but nothing could be further from the truth ‚Äî which is that Tzipora is largely the same girl as she was in 2077, but the spirit and vigour of her teen-age years and childhood curiosity have been stretched unnaturally over decades, blunting her passion and enthusiasm in all things. To the handful of people left alive that she loves, she can be as childish as ever, but the ghosts that dominate her regrets and favourite memories are starting to overcome her.\nShe is a rare case, despite thousands of boys and girls now like her across the world. She was born in a brief period where Gregori babies were born fairly healthy and independent, save for their obvious genetic malfunction. Today, among the hundreds that are born each year, nearly all of them suffer from broad anaphylaxis that renders them fragile and useless. In theory, all Gregori children will live forever save a car or the rope doesn‚Äôt get them, but as the children born with the syndrome become more and more sick very few that are born today will live beyond a normal human lifespan.\nAs for Tzipora ‚Äî in seventy years she will become the oldest human ever, living or dead.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2018-08-01-princess/","title":"Announcing the Princess of the Earth"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article predates the project, and should be considered non-canon.  Two years ago, a fission military jet plunged into the mountain behind the village of Montre-Lola, emerging moments later as a plume of fire and smoke in the shadow of the mountain peak. Villagers made their way up the slopes to help survivors, dressed in radiation suits from the town shelter. There were none. Six more lives and six more soldiers lost ‚Äî a pilot, co-pilot, navigator, reactor engineer, bombardier, and fire control officer are written down and then buried like cattle.\nSuch is the senseless cost of monthly drills, in which the well-oiled spring that sets Vekllei‚Äôs nuclear-capable arsenal upon the world quivers in anticipation. The low-lying Raya Valley Air Base fleet emerges over the snow-capped mountains twice a year, panicking farmers below them, as they make their way to auxiliary coastal bases for training.\nThis year, in usual preparation for the Festival of the Atom, the airship Dumoustra joins a fleet of jet bombers as they rendezvous with the 3rd and 5th Escort squadrons from the coast. They soar dramatically over the ribs of the North Vekllei tectonic mountain ranges, briefly roaring over the quiet farming valleys one by one as peaks pass below them.\nThe belly of the valleys have some of the best soils in the world, a gift from one of hundreds of volcanoes that are scattered across the North Atlantic nation. Mostly wheat and rice are grown. The sides of the valleys veer dramatically into near-cliffs, folded like paper by the enormous anger of the European and American continental plates.\nTrees are short and small-leaved, and often have great colour. Flower-tundras are also common here, called ro in Vekllei.\n She was in the shadow of a titan mountain range that followed the tracks as far as she could see. It sloped sharply into the valley, breaking out briefly into a thick temperate woodland before the trees withdrew and terraced wheat fields stepped down to the tracks. Vekllei is an ancient, volcanic land of igneous monument and sharp rock, softened by healthy topsoil bursting with mosses and flowers. She wiped her nose on the back of her hand, and rubbed her eyes. She had dressed up for him but she felt childish shivering on the bare station platform, if it could even qualify as such a thing. It was a bare concrete slab, forty metres long, that serviced rickety rural train cars that ran from here to the Montre terminus, where bullet-train maglevs shot to the capital on the hour.\nShe looked before her, bringing her knees to her breast, and there was the ro, in all its untouched splendour and colour. The soil here was percolated with water, and it squelched underfoot, rich with minerals and pebbles of quartz and obsidian. As far as she could see, off to her west where the sun was slowly setting, the ground was bejeweled with thick flowers, pockmarked by still pools of fresh water, that, like mirrors, reflected any image above it perfectly.\n Let me know if you want to know anything else about Vekllei or this picture.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2018-07-28-valleys/","title":"Valleys of Vekllei"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article predates the project, and should be considered non-canon.

Cool Icelandic summers have been usurped by volatile days that can be as low as 5C (40F) or as hot as 30C (85F+). Technically speaking, the unstable Atlantic pressure oscillation, of which Vekllei anchors as the Vekllei low pole, can pull in bitter cold from the Greenland currents, or warmth from the Azores tempestuously.\nSo it is that in summer, on a beach of black igneous sand from the volcanoes of this place, hot rains can descend instantly and beat pedestrians until the rains vanish, minutes later. Winters are equally unstable ‚Äî they shift between unlivable cold and sporadic thawing periods.\n This unusual climate is not unique to Vekllei. Europe is fucked, meteorologically speaking, by a series of el nino summers and instant winters that wrack Germany, Austria, Italy, and so forth.

For a country that prides itself on ‚Äòpetticoat society‚Äô, it is only suitable that Vekllei continues to pioneer the ‚Äòdazzle‚Äô warpaint in her navy.\n The most recent stock of Navy ships are all named after women‚Äôs clothes, to emphasise Vekllei‚Äôs spiritual understanding of gender in industrial society and also as a sarcastic nominer. What American or Chinese sailor wants to be defeated in naval combat by a supercruiser named after a sundress? There is humour about it. You do not see that in many chambers of navy high command.\n Two 10 inch naval cannons sit on the bow, and use large magazines that give a maximum fire rate of thirty shots a minute. A spiritual successor to the battleships of yore, supercruisers (a light battlecruiser designed for speed and use in shallow water), are designed for naval gunfire support using these cannons. The ship is also armed with anti-submarine and anti-fighter capabilities as needed. With prolonged shooting the ship is soon absorbed into a cloud of smoke and gunpowder.\nThe distinctive serpentine auxiliary funnel betrays the Sundress‚Äôs nuclear secret ‚Äî an analog diesel engine sits alongside the standard light salt reactor, to immediately take over should the advanced electrics of the ship be disrupted by the electromagnetic effects of a nuclear blast. Because of recent advances in thermal detection, both water vapour from the reactor and smoke from the diesel engine are cooled with seawater in segregated loops, hence the two funnels for two engines.\nThe navy forms a large part of the island nation‚Äôs military consciousness, and so ships are painted unconventionally as part of Vekllei Semaphore (a language within Vekllei of flags, colour and paints) for presentation in military parades.

Did you know ‚Äî many Gregori children do not form calluses on their skin, because of the intensity of their epidermic regeneration process!\nHello all,\nThe question on the mind of folks around the world is that of Gregori Children. What are they? What does it mean, to be a ‚ÄúGregori Baby‚Äù?\n Gregori Regenerative Syndrome is a developmental phenomenon that afflicts children and young teen-agers. It holds them in a prepubescent state, and so they do not grow old like you and I.\nOf the thousands of Gregori children now living in our world today, over 90 per cent of them are girls. They develop normally until an unknown point between thelarche (the beginning of puberty and the development of breasts) and menarche (a girl‚Äôs first period). In boys, this timeline is technically different but chronologically similar ‚Äî and always before sexual maturation. Girls in Vekllei might expect menarche as late as fourteen-sixteen (a fact that continues to emphasise the myth of Vekllei virgin purity), whereas boys will likely cease development a few years earlier, usually twelve-fourteen.\nGregori girls can often take the appearance of young teen-agers; they may develop breasts and grow body hair, although these phenomena are not universal among the afflicted. Nonetheless, they have not actually entered puberty proper ‚Äî estrogen is not shaping their bodies, and they will remain sterile for the rest of their lives. Boys are similar, although are usually shorter and more childlike in appearance at the onset of the Gregori process.\n So what does being Gregori actually mean?\n It means the natural biological development of these children and teen-agers has ceased and their bodies have entered an unnatural cellular cycle, which halts the ageing process and renders them immortal, at least in theory. Technically, they are still growing ‚Äî nonregenerative tissue and organs are still growing, like the brain ‚Äî but they are captured in this state forever. Doctors put the blame on a faulty genetic regenerative process, hidden somewhere in their DNA, but the exact cause is unknown.\n Do they have superpowers?\n Nothing of the sort, unfortunately! Existential questions aside, the syndrome can be as much a burden as a miracle. For example, although all Gregori children are immune to cancers and similar cellular malfunction, around 80 per cent of them suffer broad anaphylaxis, meaning that almost all foreign matter triggers an overzealous autoimmune response. This can be fatal, and the ratio of children born with Gregori anaphylaxis has only risen in recent years.\n Are there any dangers to being Gregori?\n Gregori teen-agers and children have a high turnover of cells, and some bones do not properly fuse. This renders many of the afflicted delicate and fragile ‚Äî especially children halted at a younger age. The condition is not known to affect emotional or psychological traits of the afflicted.\n The future implications of Gregori syndrome are limitless ‚Äî ignoring the secret of immortality, the ability to regenerate vital brain, spinal, and optical tissues would revolutionise medicine. Today, there are many thousands of Gregori children in the world, and so the question of their own future remains ‚Äî are they a genetic abnormality, or the next wave of human evolution?\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2018-07-10-gregori/","title":"What will become of the Gregori Children?"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article predates the project, and should be considered non-canon.

For a few dozen precious minutes each day, curtains are flung open, children stream into the street, and office folk take a smoke break.

Each person in Vekllei has three names ‚Äî a given name (Tzipora), a surname (Desmoines), and an alternative given name as part of rapotenne (potenne is ‚Äòhandtalk‚Äô, upotenne is ‚Äòspirit-talk‚Äô, and so it follows that rapotenne is the language system of names). This alternative name is a ‚Äòkey‚Äô to the full blood name of an individual, which are given in secret by the mother traditionally, but can be gifted by any mother-figure.\nFor all intents and purposes, ‚ÄòTzipora Desmoines‚Äô works exactly as ‚ÄòJohn Smith‚Äô ‚Äî a distinguishing name and the ancestral name. In Vekllei, the men take the name of the child-bearer.\nTzipora‚Äôs blood name, her rapotenne, instead reads as: Zelda lo Ula Desmoines. This is a name she should never reveal until her death, so rites can be performed.\nAlthough Vekllei‚Äôs monarchy is long dead, ancestors are still held sacred by these people. They hold ancient family names that tie their blood to the earth. They are also used when talking with spirits, as they are part of upotenne, the external language of the soul. In this sense, blood names operate as a sacred vocal rune.\nPictured above is Tzipora receiving her blood name from a father-figure many years ago. Since she has no bloodline left alive, he fulfills the role of a father and gives her a name constructed of several parts, researched and tailored to her.\n Zelda is a nickname and a moniker Tzipora has used to hide her Jewishness, and so works perfectly as a public ‚Äòkey‚Äô to her blood name. lo Ula (her blood of Ula in upotenne) is her ancient, sacred title. The name-giver has not been able to trace her blood to the times of spirits, so he‚Äôs traced it as far back as he could and scoured that region for a proper title. Ula is a combination of two words ‚Äî Ura, a type of bare, wind-swept coastal shelf in Northern Vekllei, where Tzipora‚Äôs bloodlines originate, and the Vekllei word for iceberg. It also links to an ancient Vekllei saga ‚Äî in which a proud and mighty iceberg is reduced to ice-pebbles after being dashed against the northern rocks. A story of mortality, it is a warning for Tzipora, who does not age. Desmoines is the family name, unchanged for centuries, and is fairly common in Vekllei.

In Vekllei animism, which branches into a vast and complex set of beliefs and traditions that vary from village to village, there is no formal religious structure. Temples and shrines pay respect to sprites, which are universally understood as bi-planar creatures. There is no formal religious structure, and so animistic tradition has no priests.\nCeremonial dress is simple to describe, but complex to assemble. The shape and form of the dress, including cascade peplums (a series of peplums that hang over the skirt of the dress) and sun petticoats are traditional, but they hold no religious value outside of the connection to your ancestors who performed the same rites before you. Tradition is very important in Vekllei.\nSprites, and to a lesser extent spirits, are fiercely attracted to supernatural colour and shine (polished gemstones, plastics, metals, etc). Pure and natural metals are most alluring to the sprites, as they hold the lustre of the Earth (as well as exude undetectable submagnetic fields called ecec) but they can be substituted with synthetic gold and bronze, as can gemstones, all of which are mass-produced in the industrial city centres of Vekllei.\nTo meet a sprite, and offer it food, you should dress in these materials. Often villages will collectively maintain traditional outfits for talking to sprites, some of which are hundreds of years old and require care to put on. Sprites can see like you and me, so covering yourself in gold won‚Äôt simply do the trick ‚Äî you should dress neatly and politely. It is not necessary to purge yourself of all modern things ‚Äî wristwatches, shoes, hairpieces are all fine, as long as you‚Äôve taken care in your appearance.\nAppease a sprite, and you might notice lost items turning up, and cracked roof tiles begin to sparkle like new. To befriend a spirit is to have plenty to harvest that season, as well as protection from heavy rains.\nTzipora Zelda Desmoines, miracle girl of the village of Montre-Lola, holds a pose in upotenne: the physical language of spirits. As potenne supplements language in Vekllei with sign gestures, upotenne turns your body into an ancient rune, and protects the site from disturbing fields that might scare a sprite. It‚Äôs not necessary to hold it for long ‚Äî just acknowledge it. This one performed by Tzipora predates Vekllei language and script ‚Äî no one today can speak it. It lives on today only in physical form, and in that moment time collapses and she is in this place with her ancestors.\nJust a quick sketch.

Hopefully you won‚Äôt have to worry about the police while you‚Äôre in Vekllei, but you‚Äôll likely notice them. Police are everywhere ‚Äî as an alternative to military (duoroten) service, conscripts can elect to enter domestic security (inroten). Most officers are young, bored, and live in the community they police. You‚Äôll likely be talking to them at some point in your visit, even if it‚Äôs only to ask for directions ‚Äî in Vekllei, cops are the bulletin boards of the community.\nAll beat cops are unarmed, and carry extendable truncheons that swing from their belt. Much more rarely, you‚Äôll see professional officers ‚Äî you‚Äôll notice them, because they ride in cars. Professional officers travel in pairs, and the senior officer is known as a firearm officer, and will carry a sidearm.\nShould you be detained by police, keep the following in mind:\n Vekllei is a casual culture. Some officers will speak English, but the concept of ‚Äòsir‚Äô has never entered their vocabulary. They will approach and interact with you casually ‚Äî professionalism operates differently here. Nor will they bow to you, except in stations. If you act hysterical, they will cease to take you seriously. Keep your cool, be friendly, talk clearly. Vekllei is a physical culture. Police will touch, pull, and push you without communicating. This is not an intimate or aggressive gesture ‚Äî they will just as soon pull you out of the thoroughfare of a sidewalk as restrain you. Vekllei police do not heavily employ firearms, but are liberal with the baton. Only when responding to a firearm call will police approach with a firearm in hand. Otherwise, they will rest a baton on their shoulder and are trained to use it against you, should you attempt to fight them. In a country without currency, there is no such thing as ‚Äòdamages‚Äô. Public drunkenness is not tolerated in Vekllei and is not an excuse for fighting with police.  With all that said, Vekllei has an extremely low crime rate and it is very unlikely you‚Äôll ever see cops responding to a crime. More often you‚Äôll see them escorting other emergency service vehicles through pedestrian streets, arguing with locals and doing odd jobs around the community. Especially in rural communities, there is very little distinction between on and off-duty cops, and beat cops will often wear their uniform around town while unassigned to a shift.\nIn the picture above we see professional cops, or copa, watching a suspect from across the street. We can tell they are professional officers because they wear red and white uniforms, instead of the navy, red and white of beat cops. The woman is a firearm officer, and carries a revolver in her holster. The man is not armed but carries a baton on his shoulder.\nThe police car, a Model 10 (Special), sits low to the ground, weighed with a 60MWe Molten Salt Reactor where we‚Äôd usually find the trunk. The car has a theoretical top speed of 400km/h, but will never reach anywhere close to that ‚Äî pursuits are extremely rare in the country, as almost no-one has a personal automobile. On its roof it carries two cherry lights and a single Dura wailer siren. The service number, 6, tells us that the unit is from the Montre region.\nAs for the suspect?

Vekllei has a pan-pacific flavour of greeting, usually a bow followed by a handshake. If you‚Äôre going to fit in, you‚Äôre going to have to learn how to do it right. Let‚Äôs get started.\nFirst, Vekllei is extremely physical in its language. Not expressive, like how you might picture an Italian or American. Instead, it incorporates an auxiliary language called potenne or, ‚ÄòHand-Talk‚Äô, which accompanies words. A forefinger sliding across a forefinger is ‚Äògood‚Äô or, ‚Äòacknowledged‚Äô, and can be used with verbalising the word or as a signal.\nSimilarly, bowing takes on elements of potenne. There are hundreds of ways to bow, but there are a few basic rules that will make your time in Vekllei easier.\n The angle of the bow determines the seriousness of the gesture. A ninety-degree bow is most-serious, used for meeting foreigners of importance, apologising profusely, or welcoming a prestigious guest. In modern Vekllei, where mateship has displaced traditional hierarchy, it is rarely used except in service of others. Most common is fifteen degrees, with a maximum of forty-five in polite, formal conversation. You must not speak while bowing. The act is a word in itself and it is loud and obnoxious to speak and act. Welcome, or apologise, or thank the partner. Then bow. Formal bowing, as employed in serious or dire times as a collective action, is taken on the knees on the floor. The head is pressed against the ground. Those unable to kneel can lower their heads. The most obvious example of this for the reader is in the ten-minutes mourning following the Lola nuclear attack, when every able-bodied citizen faced the district and bowed in honour of the dead.  Let‚Äôs observe Tzipora Zelda Desmoines, miracle girl of Montre-Lola, in three types of bowing you are most likely to encounter in your travels.\n With hands interlocked, hanging parallel to the legs, the greeting bow is most common and works as a friendly gesture. Make sure to lock your fingers properly. Only with foreigners will you bow with your arms straight by your sides, so make sure to let the arms dangle perpendicular to your legs. To apologise, or excuse yourself, place your fingers gently on your neck and bow to the degree it is appropriate. Close your eyes. If the person has more to say, release your hands from the back of your neck, listen, then repeat the gesture. A welcome bow, employed as a gesture of solidarity, welcomes you into homes and places of business. This is not a ‚Äòhello‚Äô, this is a, ‚Äòhow may I serve you?‚Äô. Forms fists with your hands and place them over your chest. Do not bow your head, and keep eye contact with the partner. It is unusual for foreigners to perform this bow, unless they are employed in some capacity. In Vekllei, this translates more literally to greetings, mate,‚Äô and the service is implied.  Keep in mind that Vekllei does not use honourifics, and supplements titles with bows. These are important. Use them luxuriously, and have fun! Vekllei people will appreciate the gesture from a foreigner.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2018-05-01-bowing/","title":"How to Bow (and Fashion in Vekllei)"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article predates the project, and should be considered non-canon.  Welcome to Vekllei. It is a strange country with a complex culture that is quite distinct (and sometimes outrageous) to Western countries. This will be a long post. I‚Äôve tried to keep it clear.\n Women in Vekllei usually wear skirts in winter. There are cultural and historical reasons for this, explained below. Pictured here is Tzipora in a winter Vekllei outfit so typical it works well enough here to give a show-and-tell. The outfit consists of underwear (vest, stockings/socks, etc.), an inner lace petticoat, a cotton thermal pettiskirt, and a wool outer skirt. They reach about the mid-shin. She wears a thick cotton shirt over her vest and a rayon cardigan on top, with cotton gloves. Although not pictured here, when heading out a long wool overcoat would protect from the fierce Vekllei wind.\nThe colours are not wintery, but that requires context. The history of language and gender are not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea, but if you want to know more, let‚Äôs get started.\n Winters in Vekllei are long and dark. In the depths of it the sun rises only for about an hour. Temperatures range between 5 and -15 centigrade. By all accounts it is not a place for skirts.\nBut many women don‚Äôt consider thick or multilayered trousers. This is because womanhood is tied very clearly to physical appearance. Vekllei lacks gender pronouns entirely, but has very clear feminine and masculine words. Vekllei written language is logographic, and so you ‚Äòconstruct‚Äô concepts out of images. So certain gender concepts, like femininity, are constructed out of feminine associations that ‚Äòbuild‚Äô a sensation and understanding of what it means to be female. Skirts are a part of that. To feel like a woman in Vekllei, there are explicit images that build femininity.\nThat is not to say Vekllei is necessarily misogynist, at least as we understand it through a Western lens ‚Äî the political and cultural understanding of the country (usually called ‚Äòpetticoat socialism‚Äô) strongly suggests that our fundamental ‚Äòhuman‚Äô traits are inherently female.\n It emphasises the overall ‚Äòfemininity‚Äô of humanity and shifts the human core to female, and then distinguishes masculine traits as radical and far from the centre of the human condition. Petticoat feminism takes on economic qualities and a radical reading of gender to describe its main point of function and praxis ‚Äî that masculine qualities are inherently economic, and that they will cease to be masculine as petticoat socialism achieves its aim of rendering labour unnecessary for all reasons except self-satisfaction. In petticoat feminism, the final form of the human race is female ‚Äî not in a biological sense, but in a cultural attitude that has essentially ceased to distinguish between masculine and feminine qualities, while retaining what it views as inherently female virtues.\nFragility, grace, beauty, leisure, and reproduction are placed upon the shoulders of men, rendering them ‚Äòfemale‚Äô in the lexicon of petticoat feminism, and thus relieving them of the economic burden of masculinity.\n Knowing all that, it still basically means that skirts are for women, and women wear skirts to feel like women. Vekllei clothing has thus become multilayered and insulated to adapt to the shift from summer to winter.\nAs far as colours go, Vekllei is volcanic and geographically active. Fire and ice are synonymous here. This means that red and blues are associated with keeping warm and ice, and yellows and greens are for the lush foliage in the warmer seasons. It is uncommon to wear reds in the summer ‚Äî it‚Äôs too hot to need colours associated with fire.\nThis post is long enough, I think. Tzipora is in the wind but looks happy enough. If you have questions about the language itself, or what the annotations say, just ask.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2018-04-16-winter-clothing/","title":"Winter Clothing (and Womanhood in Vekllei)"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article predates the project, and should be considered non-canon.  This is a concept of a Vekllei Rocketry Corp rail ICBM launcher. It has distinctive-looking carriages, and so it serves no real purpose in being a ‚Äòhidden‚Äô ICBM launcher. Instead, this train is for testing rail-mounted ICBMs, which are then employed in plain and unmarked railcars. Today it idles by the lakeside town of Dupot-Monan, as its senior control staff await a hot lunch driven in from the town. All equipment, including the silo, is extended.\nIt uses two nuclear locomotives, which produce many thousands of times more power than is required to operate the vehicle and launcher. They have radiating fans as a primary air intake. The launch car has an articulating hydraulic arm that raises the silo. Rail-mounted ICBMs launch ‚Äòcold‚Äô. They are propelled out of the tube by gases within the silo, and only ignite outside of the train.\nIn 2127, the Soviets, U.S., China and Vekllei all employ hidden rail-launched ICBMs as a ‚Äòdead-hand‚Äô that can retaliate after an atomic attack. They rove the countryside of these superpowers, by all appearances regular cargo trains, invisible to spies and spy satellites alike. Rail-mounted ICBMs, and their testing, is one of the more frequently-broken clauses of the latest atomic weapons treaties. It is an unkept secret. This train, ‚ÄòMissile Carriage 2,‚Äô is on its way to the rocketry test facility sixty kilometres away. With two nuclear locomotives attached, the trip will take less than fifteen minutes.

This post is part discussion, part lore.\nKojin Karatani, on the subject of childhood, writes;\n Of course, children have existed since ancient times, yet \u0026lsquo;the child\u0026rsquo; as we conceive of it and objectify it did not exist prior to a particular period [\u0026hellip;].\nFrom this viewpoint, it becomes clear that the grouping of children by age in the compulsory educational system of modern Japan signified the uprooting of children, as abstract and homogenous entities, from productive relations, social classes, and communities that had previously been their concrete contexts.\n For my own world (the city-state of Vekllei and her alternate future) this idea is is something I‚Äôm experimenting with. As people of a modern world, we may contain within ourselves biases about what ‚Äòchildhood‚Äô is.\nKaranati‚Äôs fundamental point is that, following the Meiji Restoration in Japan, their education system modernised, and took on the Western idea of a ‚Äòchild‚Äô. Today, the development of children is staggered through very specific age groups ‚Äî they play with kids their own age, they learn with kids their own age, and what we expect of them accompanies, in part, how we‚Äôve structured school.\nSo in my world, I‚Äôve tried to develop a system in which almost all age groups, or at least large groupings of them, learn inside the same classroom. If 25% of rooms in a school are dedicated general-learning classrooms, what could you do with the rest of the space? Dedicated science/language/athletic centres? Likewise, how would children playing with both older and younger kids influence their social development. And how would work (or employment), either in agrarian or industrial contexts, impact their growth as people?\nAs for lore:\nI‚Äôve tried to sketch a uniform here that is both visually interesting and simple enough to assemble (the girl, in this case, is wearing a less-common, formal variation). In keeping with the ideas above, the uniform would be consistent across all year groups.\nThings of note on the girl\n Flowers are a large part of femininity, in particular ‚Äògirlishness‚Äô, and elaborate headdresses like the one here are common for picture days and ceremony She wears a lace apron above her skirt, under the pleat, called a ‚ÄòSoitres Deh‚Äô (soo-treh deh), which is ceremonial and very delicate. Some wear it to announce they‚Äôve entered a relationship. Usually not worn to school.  Things of note on the boy\n His cap, while part of the uniform, is more commonly worn in fields and factories as a labourer‚Äôs cap, and is emblazoned with the emblem of the enterprise or school. Very common in Vekllei.  So what to you think? I‚Äôve given enough detail to stop people reading it, but not enough to properly explore the idea of childhood. What do you think?

Tzipora is the oldest person alive, now aged 1,056 years. With the body, temperament, and vitality of an 11-year-old, and the lived experience of a dozen generations, she is a victim Gregori syndrome. She has seen man rise from Earth into space, and although she still calls her birth-country of Vekllei on Earth home, she frequently tours the cosmos as part of complex interplanetary diplomacy. The press calls her the Princess of the Earth.\nIn 3,119 A.D., she visits the Ra system. She meets the people there, called Roala, who were once descendents of East Asia on Earth. Here she takes part in an ancient ritual in which she bridges herself between the spirit and human worlds.\n She is dressed in both ordinary Vekllei clothing, which is familiar and Earthly, and Roala ceremonial dress patterned with reflective gems.\n Using her left hand, she guides the angle of power. Her right hand, raised above her head, is the focus of power and is anchored to the human world by her left foot. If she breaks the angle directed by her left hand, and they become unaligned, she will lose her physical space in both worlds and collapse into nothing.  For a few minutes at a time, she is able to see and contact both the human and spirit worlds.\n As she closes the ritual, the power of the stars wane, and so her heart becomes an auxiliary power source to help close the bridge.

It is the largest of the localised Vekllei espionage agencies, with little judicial oversight and a nationalistic fervour that makes the Rocketry Corps one of the largest internal threats in the United States today.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2017-10-19-spies/","title":"Two Spies and a Vekllei Girl"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article predates the project, and should be considered non-canon.  Suddenly the blood drained from her lungs and she breathed in, only to double over, hacking blood into the grass between her shoes. She wiped her bloody mouth on the back of her arm and mumbled something like ‚Äòsorry‚Äô before coughing again. She slipped off her shoes and made her way to the clearing.\nShe saw the bones and knelt in front of them, laying some flowers out for it and waiting respectfully. After a few minutes she worked up the nerve to open her mouth, and when she wasn‚Äôt attacked, she began to talk to it in a soft little voice. She said she wanted to go to the spirit world, and it did nothing. She said she needed to go there because she‚Äôd been having dreams about great monsters rising up and destroying humanity. It didn‚Äôt move, and she glanced at the forest spirits that had gathered around her. She clasped her hands together and started to introduce herself to the bones. She was Tzipora, she grew up in the city of Vekllei not far from here, her parents died when she was young and her adoptive mother was struck by a truck and killed last summer. She loves her father and country and doesn‚Äôt want it to be destroyed.\nAs she talked more she found herself saying aloud things she‚Äôd never said before. About being a Gregori baby, about feeling separated from the rest of the human race, about the time she went to a festival with a Japanese boy who was gone now. She said she liked to write and hadn‚Äôt ever eaten a hotdog but she wanted to, and that once the older girls molested her out the back of the school. She said she liked her hair when it was like this; bouncy and self-regulating. She didn‚Äôt know why it wouldn‚Äôt stay like this all the time, but she didn‚Äôt have a hairbrush, so it was good that it looked good today.\nAn hour passed and she ran out of things to say and realised her entire life could fit in a conversation on an average bus trip. She unclasped her hands but didn‚Äôt dare shift from her kneel. All of a sudden, the grass beneath her disappeared and she plummeted, shoes, flowers and all, into darkness.\n The above passage was written with this picture. This is the moment that Tzipora, a Gregori baby enters the spirit world to stop ancient creatures called Lehmenan from destroying the world. The Lehmenan are restless after a nuclear war between China and the United States. Very few people, and all of them children, know that spirits exist. Alone and terrified of losing the world to the Lehmenan, Tzipora goes to the bones of the Lehmenan‚Äôs creator, the now-extinct Derden, and asks it to let her into the spirit world.\nI understand this is quite a lot to take in.

Vekllei people are usually buried in their national dress. It marks the important stages in their way of life; of graduation, of marriage, of ceremony. The carousel of festivals and parades and holidays that these Atlantic people enjoy are all spent in uniform, their national costume, that forms the public face of their country.\nLou and Mey here, two happy young things in love, are dressed up for the National Holiday. It is the biggest event of the year. Mey wears a flower as a hairpiece and a red pinafore in the national colours. Under her Lawhsk Ehma, which is equivalent to a ‚ÄúMaiden‚Äôs Apron‚Äù in English, she has a wide lace half-petticoat called a Doeh. The Doeh is unique to each girl, and is designed for them at menarche, or her first period. The little lace patterns have special meaning that inscribe parts of her personality, her background and her work. They are always buried with the girl, either worn or folded and pocketed. In Vekllei they wear red sandals and white socks or stockings to match the flag.\nThey both wear the Eliese flower, and usually another pin that marks their heritage ‚Äî the son of a shipbuilder will wear the maritime cross. Both Lou and Mey here wear the Industry Roundel Star. His father is a dyehouse foreman and her mother works as a machinist in a robot factory. Lou wears a half-cape, barely visible here, that is called a Toutahn and is usually handed down, as opposed to the Doeh. The white cap is both part of the national dress and ceremonial dress in the armed forces. Lou smokes, which is uncommon but not unheard of for sixteen-year-olds.\nOn the National Holiday, which lasts a week, all of Vekllei is put on display. Aircraft carriers dock for visitors, the parliament dissolves for a week and is opens its doors to the public, and a thumping nightlife begins to introduce teenagers like Lou and Mey here to the finer things of life.\nIf you have any questions or comments, let me know!\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2017-10-13-national-dress/","title":"The National Dress of Vekllei"},{"content":" Archived from the original article here  ‚ùñ This article predates the project, and should be considered non-canon.

Anyone who wasn‚Äôt looking at the sky didn‚Äôt know it yet. To folks indoors or out of view of the vapour trails, it was still a beautiful spring. It took a half hour for Vekllei missiles to reach China. Theirs took about the same to get here.\nThe sirens didn‚Äôt go off until five minutes after the missiles launched. You could tell they were civil defense sirens because they built up to a whine and stayed there, a sound they‚Äôd all heard in drills, but it wasn‚Äôt drill season.

In Vekllei, two bombs hit, and the rest of the Chinese delivery aircraft was downed by the air force. The two small-yield ground-burst weapons killed only 20,000. Many millions were saved by the comprehensive civil defense of the country. The United States lost forty million people. China is unknown, but is likely in the hundreds of millions after the full retaliatory strike from two separate countries.\nThe war had wider consequences, as it awakened ancient creatures underground that were built to protect the Earth. The creatures, called Lehmenan in a dead tongue, would in the weeks following the war attempt to wipe the surface of the world clean of human society.\nYou can read about Tzipora here and here.

In the narrow streets of the Lola district in Vekllei, artisans and artists hurry about, peddling art and fine goods and attracting the rest of the city to its stores.

Many serve their country, others fall in love. This shop owner found his. He stocks books, apples, rare foodstuffs and anything that takes his fancy, like an eclectic general store. There are few supermarkets in the country. The demands of the collectivised economy for constant overproduction and total employment results in decentralised distribution like we see here. Tzipora is eleven. She doesn‚Äôt understand all that. But she understands that her mother wants spiced meats for a platter, and Lola is the best place to find seasonal or exotic foods like spiced meat.\nTwelve festivals rouse creativity out of the otherwise sleepy Vekllei economy. The festival of feasts, in September, halts regular production and many restaurants switch to exotic foods. During this month, cafes and restaurants are overflowing with people jawing about where they‚Äôve been while cramming their mouths with Oriental, American and South American staples.

This is Tzipora. She is eleven years old, scruffy, and a Gregori baby. At the turn of the 21st century, Gregori Hordiyenko, a Ukrainian boy aged nine and a half, stopped aging entirely. By 2063, which is the year Tzipora turned eleven, there are about two hundred Gregori babies in the world, mostly living in secret. Certain religious sects, including Catholics, view Gregori babies as a sign of the Lord‚Äôs action and as a movement towards an approaching religious event.

The oldest Gregori baby is fifty-six and lives in Florida. Gregori himself was run down and killed in an accident in his twenties. Gregori babies have no other defining characteristic; they have been found in the Orient and in Africa and in Europe, they have different levels of wellness and many have entirely unremarkable lives.\nTzipora is Vekllei‚Äôs first Gregori baby, although she was abroad when she was diagnosed.

As a child, she has not yet quite understood the magnitude of what has been stripped from her: she will never be able to maintain friends as they age without her, she will never grow up or marry, and assuming she naturally survives, she will watch everyone die before her. As a Gregori baby, she can be killed as any other human being can. The one exception to her condition is cancer and tumour-related diseases, of which she will be immune. Her father calls her ‚Äúangel‚Äù, and the pet name took on a new meaning as her condition was realised.\nTzipora is religious and believes in a single God and spirits, but dislikes him and blames him for her own situation, shifting her faith into Vekllei and humanity.

Set ostensibly in Iceland, the history and geography of this country is radically different from our own, and welcomes an open exploration of new systems of living through a flexible alternate history.  V ekllei (also The Vekllei Commonwealth, Islandi, Iceland) is a sovereign island country situated in the northern Atlantic, between Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Besides the 100 boroughs of the conterminous Vekllei city-state (referred to as the Home Island or Crown Metropole), Vekllei includes two autonomous territories, six crown territories and various possessions including over a hundred satellite islands and islets. It is the 14th most densely-populated country in the world, with a population of 24.4 millions mostly situated around the Capital Region in the south-west of the Home Island. Its capital and largest city is Vekllei in the Capital Region, which is home to two-thirds of the total population. The interior plateau of the Home Island consists of sand and lava fields, flower-tundras, glaciers, and temperate rainforests, and its lowlands are home to many glacial rivers.\nThe Home Island has been inhabited for at least four thousand years by Arctic peoples migrating from Kalalist (Greenland). Evidence of European settlement in Vekllei can be determined from unearthed fishing towns dated to 1230BC, when settlers from Ireland established fishing communities along the southern coast.\nSubsequent centuries saw rapid growth of the local population, which was politically and culturally isolated from mainland Europe by the 6th Century BC. By the 4th Century BC, many contemporary cultural features of the country had become commonplace, including an early form of Upen and Vekllei logographs. During the following millennia Vekllei developed into a major economic and military power, but saw its influence decline between the 12th and 15th Centuries AD during the Period of Rest.\nLife in coastal boroughs like Santes continues much as it has for hundreds of years | Shrine-Minded Girls  During Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Middle Period, the country was struck by civil unrest that escalated into civil war, which installed Aismo Desimou as the first King of Vekllei. The monarchy succeeded until Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s colonial Late Period, which fell to a navy coup d\u0026rsquo;etat that installed a military junta in government, which rapidly expanded Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s colonial holdings. This practice would continue well into the 20th Century, and would spark the Africa Wars and Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s atomic bombing by the United Kingdom in 2005, which collapsed the existing regime and ushered in British occupation of the country.\nSince independence in 2015, Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Floral Period has transformed the country, and has been marked by a period of tremendous stability and economic growth. Vekllei does not use money domestically, with most internal trade dependent on social exchange, barter and state service, but operates twin currencies (the Government and Vekllei Crown) in its trade internationally.\nVekllei is a great power and has the world\u0026rsquo;s fifth highest military expenditure. The country is highly developed and has exceptional liveability, and is placed highly in key social indicators: education, healthcare, quality of life, personal safety and housing, with a home-ownership rate of nearly 96%. It is a member of the United Nations' Non-Aligned Concern League.\nSince independence, Vekllei has maintained a strong position of armed neutrality, and is home to many international organisations, including the new United Nations Office, the International Federation of Journalists and the Universal Post Union. Immigrants account for 30% of the population, and multiracialism is enshrined in the constitution, and continues to shape national policies in education, housing, and politics. Vekllei has large foreign-born populations from Eastern and Southern Europe, North Africa, the British Isles, Hong Kong, and Latin America.\nIntroduction A tourist map of Vekllei, showing the natural features of the Home Islands.  Vekllei, officially the Vekllei Commonwealth, is a society blossoming with contradictions and anachronisms, which reflect and fold into each other to produce new forms of living. The country advocates laissez-faire market participation and soviet-style central planning simultaneously; it is the site of a healthy new democracy utterly divorced by public apathy, and a place of midcentury science-worship and automation used to bolster backwardness and agrarian living. This idea carries on and on, cascading throughout all levels of society.\nThis is a nation bound constitutionally to secularism and religious freedoms, described in a document only legible through indigenous spiritualism. This is a culture intent on abolishing commodity-forms through the worship of products. To foreigners, Vekllei is a wonderland of contradictions that in conventional imagination would collapse in on each other, yet Vekllei has flourished in postwar independence, quickly rising up amongst the most developed and livable countries in the world.\nSuch a country deserves observation, then. This document and its subarticles are dedicated to the country of Vekllei and the facts of its utopian dimensions, and hope to illustrate a definitive and contemporary understanding of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Epoch of Rest (what they call their \u0026lsquo;floral period\u0026rsquo;). This is an illustration of how the beating systems in Vekllei look, the abstract data laid bare. Vekllei has an absurd multidimensionality about it, since it is a country in which all things are singularly perfect in their purity and good-heartedness while applying this qualifier to multiple ideas at the same time. In some ways, Vekllei thrives because of rather than in spite of these contradictions. This document is a good place to start.\nEtymology The word Vekllei comes from the Islandi-Quutetast fusion dialect called Topyas (\u0026lsquo;Old Vekllei\u0026rsquo; in English), which was in common use by the 1st Century AD. It comes from the Topyas words for \u0026ldquo;volcanic town,\u0026rdquo; or Vek, and \u0026ldquo;sea under the stars,\u0026rdquo; or Lei, meaning \u0026ldquo;town of the stars by the sea\u0026rdquo;. According to sagas, the name was gifted to the country by a volcanic spirit-god called Tipet (most likely present-day Kesmi) in the 3rd Century, but was likely a feature of Queen Souisviasn\u0026rsquo;s language reforms during that time.\nThe word \u0026ldquo;Vekllei\u0026rdquo; refers to both the country and the island, and is also pluralised.\nVekllei was first known as Islandi, or \u0026ldquo;Land of Ice\u0026rdquo; in an extinct Indo-European language documented under the same name in early sagas, but is likely at least partially derived from Algic-Aleutian Quutetast word for \u0026ldquo;snow,\u0026rdquo; Ismo. Sagas award Faroese settler Ann Sigf√∫sdottir with the island\u0026rsquo;s discovery and name, though little else is known of her.\nThe name Vekllei ostensibly applies foremost to the physical landscape of the country, of which the present city-state inherits its name. In addition, the people of Vekllei, language, and all subsequent pluralisations are also Vekllei.\nGeography Vekllei is an ancient country of striking geological monument. A landscape of igneous rock and lava flows, Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s dramatic geology is tempered by its healthy abundance of rainforests and flower-tundras, which paint the country in soft mossy hues of green and yellow.  Vekllei sits atop the constructive boundary of the Mid-Atlantic ridge, bridging the North American and the Eurasian tectonic plates. The country is also found between the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans, although the entirety of the Home Island is situated beneath the arctic circle. Despite this, the extreme latitude of inhabited areas means daylight is highly seasonal in the country, with dark winters and summer solstices that provide 23 consecutive hours of daylight. This dramatic seasonal environment has ongoing political, economic and cultural relevance in the country today, and contributes to the dependence on hothouses and greenhouses for agriculture throughout the year.\nThe unstable Atlantic pressure oscillation, of which Vekllei anchors as the Vekllei Low Pole, can pull in bitter cold from the Greenland currents, or warmth from the Azores tempestuously. This gifts the Home Islands a temperate, though subarctic climate, with average temperatures in summer of about 18-25 degrees centigrade that decline into an annual mean low of approximately 10 degrees in the Capital Region. The good weather and seasonal daylight inform Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s animistic spiritualism, with festivals to mark both solstices.\nVekllei sits between North American and Continental European territories, but is usually regarded as independent of both because of its central position in the North Atlantic and its peripheral possessions, which include Kala (Greenland) and the Aismious Islands (Faroe Islands). Because of its volcanic origins and position above the Earth\u0026rsquo;s Great Kiss (the Mantle Plume), Vekllei remains highly volcanic and several volcanoes remain active in the country. The world\u0026rsquo;s newest island, Liyra, was formed in 2056 off Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s South Coast.\nVekllei is the world\u0026rsquo;s 18th largest island, and has significant biological and climate diversity for a landmass of its size. Southern Vekllei is wet, seasonal and temperate, populated mostly by temperate rainforests and spruce forests. Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s glacial interior is dominated by flower-tundras, called Ro, and barren vegetation consisting mostly of grasslands, plains, and isolated woodland. Lava fields, mountains and massive freshwater glaciers are also common throughout the middle and east of the country. Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s north is dry and subarctic, and receives heavy snowfall and ice in winter months. The entire Home Islands are marked by dramatic volcanic landscapes of steep igneous rock, valleys and glacial monuments. Vekllei has some of the tallest waterfalls in the world. The country has the highest number of flowers per capita in the world.\nPolitics A map showing Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s dense rail network linking the 100 boroughs of the Home Islands | 100 Boroughs  Politics in Vekllei are characterised by postwar constitutional values of nonpartisan democracy and transparency of power. Political concern is aestheticised and developed along cultural and interpersonal lines; as a feature of life, but fundamentally participatory. In truth, at least with regards to domestic concern, Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s daily affairs are basically autonomous, and politics remains the concern of an educated, invested class of people.  Vekllei is a unitary city-state and nonpartisan parliamentary democracy, divided into crown lakes, boroughs and provincial administrative divisions. It retains the territory of Vekllei as a sovereign of the country, in keeping with Upen, but otherwise the prime ministers have equal executive power, with disputes mediated by the Crown Senate. Vekllei retains a parliamentary system as a legacy of British occupation, but has since developed several indigenous features including its land-sovereign and twin ministership. The Vekllei system also incorporates American political features, including a constitution and bicameral house system.\nVekllei\u0026rsquo;s government is portioned between three branches:\n The Legislature, represented by Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s bicameral parliament and the landscape sovereign. The Executive, represented by the prime ministers and the elected ministerial cabinet. The Judiciary, represented by the High Court and Constitutional Court of Vekllei, whose judges are appointed by the lower house and cabinet.  Vekllei uses a Hare-Clark single transferable vote system to elect two prime ministers, one man and one woman, the only such system in the world. Vekllei has a bicameral legislature, consisting of an upper house (the Crown Senate) of 100 senators and a lower house (People\u0026rsquo;s Assembly) of 200 members. Although voting is participatory and the country does not maintain a poll tax, electoral enrolment is mandatory from age 16 onwards.\nSince Vekllei is nonpartisan, it does not allow formal participation of parties within elections. Despite this, informal associations of elected representatives exist, in the form of sociopartit, or Party Associations. The largest of these include the Vekllei Industrial Working Concern, the Atlantic Party, and the Crown Brotherhood, and although membership is permitted among elected members they are otherwise disallowed within the electoral process.\nAdministrative divisions A map showing Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s overseas territories, including claims in the Lesser Antilles, Antarctica and the Lunar South Pole | Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Sprawling Commonwealth  ‚ùñ See also: Boroughs of Vekllei  Although Vekllei is unitary politically and considers itself a city-state, the Home Islands are divided geographically between 100 boroughs (as part of the borough system). Each borough is proportional to the land-sovereign\u0026rsquo;s natural wealth, which accounts for its history, folklore and natural features. Because of this, the human population of boroughs is highly disproportionate, the smallest being Bakur, in the Afouismeh region, with a population of 7,500 people, and the largest being Vekllei proper, in the Capital Region, of 2.4 millions.\nEach borough elects a Senator and two House Members. Overseas Crown Lakes territories vote in ministerial elections but do not vote for legislative members, and autonomous territories maintain their own parliaments.\n Crown Lakes, or Kronaislagaisdelfia, are governmental territories of human concern, analogous to public land or federal territory overseas. Crown Land, or Kronaismioudelfia, are nongovernmental territories of natural reservation. Although similar in some ways to nature reserves or national parks, their legal status in Vekllei is somewhat more complex; although de facto part of the country, the government does not recognise human sovereignty over these regions, a feature inherited from Upen. Boroughs, or Baras, are administrative regions in Vekllei named for their largest population centres. They form the basic subdivision of Vekllei territory and also constitute voting regions in the electoral system. Provinces, or Piousvincinia, are the territories in Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s possession outside of the Home Islands. Most notably these include Kala (Greenland), the Aismious Islands (Faroe Islands), the Kalina Isles and the Azores. As inhabited provinces, both Kala and the Azores are considered autonomous territories, under purview of the Kala People\u0026rsquo;s Assembly and the Azores Holiday Government respectively. The Aismious province and various other territories are considered Crown Lakes. Vekllei also retains over a hundred satellite islands and islets, most as Crown Lands.  In total, Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s various possessions, provinces and administrative systems can be argued for as a type of federalism, though in practice more closely resembles a canton system or disparate republic.\nFloral Society         Floral Society is the informal Vekllei phrase for the postwar Vekllei state, distinguishing it from the prewar junta and monarchy. The new period is characterised by democratisation and widespread personal freedoms, but has also recalled traditional cultural history into contemporary Vekllei life. Since the war, Vekllei has been marked by rapid change, and Floral Society\u0026rsquo;s growing cultural legacy, which continues to distance it from the prewar period.\nPetticoat constitution The Petticoat Constitution (officially the Constitution of Vekllei) is Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s founding constitutional document since independence, and remains a core political and cultural factor in the country. It provides for \u0026ldquo;Atlantic-style democracy,\u0026rdquo; free association and press, and a nonpartisan judicial system among other things.\nThe Constitution is underlined by four principles of postwar Vekllei life, outlined as follows:\n Self-management and self-interest through Sundress Municipalism. Classification of property as an independent social organ of the landscape-sovereign. Abolishment of currency and currency-substitutes. Economic feminisation.  These features manifest in various forms throughout modern Vekllei, including its moneylessness, place-metaphysics, and personal freedoms. Its association with the Rebirth of Vekllei, characterised as female in Upen, gave the document its colloquial name Petticoat Constitution, after its provisions for women in democratic Vekllei society.\n Sundress Municipalism Sundress Municipalism is the way in which Vekllei settlements are organised within boroughs, and informs the way in which cities are built. Vekllei has an indigenous architecture ideology, called Newda, which conforms to planning and lifestyle principles laid out in Sundress Municipalism. The principles themselves are often represented as a seven-pointed star, with each point marking a principle. They are as follows:\n Local employment, or \u0026ldquo;commutelessness.\u0026rdquo; Slumlessness, beautification, and a will to architecture. Property stewardship. Open air and clean water. Land usefulness (\u0026quot;friendliness\u0026quot;). Private ownership of private needs. Public ownership of public needs.  Sundress Municipalism folds into broader conceptual ideas indigenous to Vekllei about space and ownership, found throughout its political system (as in the landscape sovereign) and its economy (as in product atheism). To this end, most ongoing construction and civic planning in the country invoke Sundress Municipalism as a framework.\n  Economy The borough of Lava, part of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s dense, residential satellite belt | Moments in Love  Vekllei is land of plenty and small pleasures, afforded by a post-scarcity system that positions competing systems against each other. It is made up of a startling series of contradictions \u0026ndash; one after the other, each more unusual than the last. Vekllei is a planned economy; it is also a free market. Property ownership is obfuscated by portioned sovereignty of land and product. Decommodification has devalued products in a country based on manufacturing. There are many contradictions, inefficiencies and unusual mechanisms in the Vekllei domestic market, which total to benefit the living conditions of the average person.  Although a major power, Vekllei has an unusual hybrid market system called the Vekllei Bureau System (known colloquially as Petticoat Socialism), which incorporates state-owned socialist planned economics and deregulated syndicalist vertical bureaus to benefit a free, unregulated informal market system. Most unique about the Vekllei economy is its functional moneylessness, in which domestic society has abolished currency. No widespread currency substitutes are used in ordinary life. Each citizen owns a share of the Labour Bank of Vekllei, a portion of the Government Securities Bureau designed to allow emigration from the country, and so is theoretically entitled to an equal portion of the Bank.\nTrade and materials are provided by biosynthetic robotics infrastructure and participatory work, and is supplemented in places by mandatory military service. Vekllei people enjoy a high standard of living and access to most consumer goods.\nPostwar Vekllei economics champions free association, home-ownership and informal markets. Although microeconomically Vekllei is highly liberalised, most essential goods of the country are produced in vertically integrated in labour-union Bureaus, which, although representative of private companies and independent from the government, are associated with the general political processes of the country.\nBureaus (also Bureaus Proper, as distinguished from informal Petty Bureaus) are trade unions that organise business in the country, and the largest of them include thousands of individual companies and concerns. Companies are generally cooperative enterprises in Vekllei, and so worker votes are consolidated into \u0026ldquo;Company Ballots\u0026rdquo; used to influence political affairs within a Bureau and the country at large.\nAlthough moneyless domestically, the nation maintains two currencies, known as the Vekllei Crown and the Government Crown for foreign trade.\n         The Vekllei Crown is representative of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s export-import mechanism known as the International Market. It is gold-backed, and represents the bullion value of the Market. Since the International Market is completely closed and independent of the domestic economy, its value is controlled directly by the so-called Government Bank. It is one of the few gold-backed currencies in a developed nation today. The Government Crown is not minted and used only as an investment mechanism, backed by government ‚Äúwhite bonds‚Äù which are usually measures of labour-hours or refined materials. It is, in a sense, a fiat currency alongside a gold-backed currency.  Both currencies are used for trade internationally, and float on the labour-power of the domestic economy. The Vekllei Crown is minted as a novelty, but otherwise no money is printed in the country, since Government Crowns are essentially labour-backed state bonds. Moneylessness benefits citizens in many ways, as Vekllei people do not typically maintain debts, have access to unlimited small commodities, and enjoy some of the shortest workdays and working weeks in the world, with all citizens afforded two months holiday each year.\nEmployment Vekllei has a high unemployment rate for a developed country, reported at 12.5%. About 80% of Vekllei workers belong to a trade union, usually Pettiburos or Bureaus. Nearly 2 million Vekllei people are enrolled in higher education full-time, significantly reducing the nation\u0026rsquo;s labour pool. These are accounted for politically as natural fluctuations of the deregulated Bureau System, and unemployment in the country has seen a stable reduction since the initial decades of independence. Although many citizens in Vekllei are immigrants, the country has few foreign workers, and those employed in the country tend to be high-skill and high-wage workers.\nSince no work is compensated by money in the country, international standard metrics for poverty and income per capita are obfuscated. It is generally understood that urban populations have easier access to consumer goods, but inferior access to local produce and genuine meat products. Rural populations are also more likely to take on informal work in their village or town, and may not necessarily hold membership in an industry bureau.\nIndustry All commercial enterprise in Vekllei is founded along two legal and cultural classifications:\n Venrouive is business managed by a Bureau Proper, an organ consisting of trade unions in an industry. While Bureaus are independent from government, they are for the most part bound to their concern, and so in practice Venrouive businesses are beholden to the democratic processes of the country. Senrouive is business not managed by a Bureau Proper, though it may still hold membership in a Petty Bureau. It is analogous to private enterprise.  Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s sovereign wealth fund, the Government Securities Bureau, is the largest such fund in the world with commodity and non-commodity holdings totalling over VK‚ù¶45 trillion. It is the primary investment mechanism of the Vekllei state and has generated controversy around its substantial economic power and commodity holdings abroad. Vekllei is the second-largest logistics hub in the world, and as a maritime city-state sees millions of tonnes worth of shipping traffic each year pass through its ports.\nVekllei\u0026rsquo;s Dohyo Free Port is the largest in the Atlantic and among the busiest in the world. Most of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s liquid currency assets, denominated as Government Kroner, are generated through a shipping Goods and Services Tax (GST) on all foreign business in the country of approx. 10%, of which the Dohyo Free Port contributes VK‚ù¶12 trillion each year.\nVekllei primarily exports manufactured goods, which are produced by both human and automatic labour via commodity imports and extraterrestrial materials mining as part of the Solar Concern of the Vekllei Commonwealth Materials Bureau (or Solaburo).\nMost personal or private business in Vekllei is structured as either single-person shops (S.p.A., or senrouiva pettetie anaproiouya), co-operative businesses (S.q.A., or senrouiva qualitie anaproiouya), or village factories (S.p.M., or senrouiva persimonaya manufacturie). Any commercial enterprise larger than S.p.M. tends to hold membership in or is directly administered by a Bureau Proper, though there are exceptions.\nTourism Tourism is a major source of foreign income in Vekllei, and the country attracts some 6 million tourists annually. Although the number of tourists is low compared to popular destinations in North America and Europe, Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s strict entry requirements and state monopoly on hotels and tourist infrastructure means that most visitors are high-wealth business travellers or affluent foreigners, which together contribute around 0.5% of the country\u0026rsquo;s GDP annually.\nVekllei sponsors tourism abroad via the Social Government Bank, which allows Vekllei people to withdraw superannuated cash savings for tourism and travel abroad.\nDemographics The story of Vekllei is a story of rebirth, and no better is this revealed than in the country\u0026rsquo;s cultural Aliyah after the Atomic War. Vekllei is an ancient place rediscovering itself and its people, and in the rapid development of the postwar Floral Period there are novel shifts in how Vekllei people talk, behave, and look.  Vekllei has one of the highest population densities in the world, skewed largely by the populous Capital Region. Vekllei considers itself a city-state, and to this end fosters \u0026ldquo;commonhoods\u0026rdquo;, represented by common practice, common work and common landscape. Although Vekllei has been settled for thousands of years, postwar advocation of commonhoods emphasises landscape in place of the historic blood in wake of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s growing migrant population and multiculturalism. Nearly 30% of Vekllei people were born overseas, though this number is trending down as immigration quotas (set by emigration and housing availability) restrict inflow in recent decades.\nVekllei is experiencing a slight demographic trend towards an older population, and the average age of the country stands at 35 years old.\nVekllei maintains a stable fertility rate of about 1.8 children per woman, indicating a slight decline in population. Vekllei enjoys high rates of immigration, sponsored by the government, and sees settlement from Western and Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, South-East Asia and South America. Vekllei has also experienced high rates of emigration since independence, although many expats retain citizenship and later return to residence in Vekllei at some point. To this end, Vekllei is one of the largest exporters of skilled workers and tradesmen in the world.\nLanguage ‚ùñ Main article: Language in Vekllei  Modern Vekllei language (referred to simply as Vekllei) is the national language of the country and spoken universally within the Home Islands and Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s various Atlantic possessions. It is notable for its varied sublanguages, which include a signed language called Upotenne and various extant utility scripts.\nVekllei is spoken by around 25 million people, and a further 800,000 people around the world. Its relative complexity and provinciality lend to Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s cultural obscurity abroad, since few Vekllei people are English literate.\nReligion Tzipora stands in traditional Upen dress before an offerings box. | Spiritful  ‚ùñ Main article: Religion in Vekllei  Upen is the nondenominational animism of Vekllei, and is practiced nearly universally throughout the country in various forms and traditions. As much a secular cultural tradition as an organised religion, Upen coexists alongside abrahamic and miscellaneous faiths in the country, integrating most immigrant populations in Vekllei into its scripture on landscape and sumoismiaya, or the \u0026ldquo;spirit of things.\u0026rdquo;\nWhile Vekllei has no state religion, Upen is thoroughly integrated with Vekllei culture and policy, and informs life and practice in this country as an agonistic feature of culture. Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Floral Constitution prohibits governmental regulation of religion or prohibition of faith. Despite this, Upen is taught in state schools and practiced frequently, reinforcing its relevance across younger generations in a broader resurgence of traditional folklore in the postwar era.\nAlthough most people in the country observe Upen apolitically, several other religious cultures hold sway in the country, including Catholicism (11%) Judaism (9%), Buddhism (4%), Islam (2%), Hinduism (1.3%) and Sikhism (0.7%). Despite this, Vekllei has some of the lowest rates of religious adherence in the world, estimated at a mere 6%, signifying Upen\u0026rsquo;s cultural influence on personal practice and informal ritual.\nEducation Students in the uniform of Vekllei government schools | A New Generation  Education in Vekllei is structured as a State Requisite Bureau (rather than department) under the requoisesiasn amourisocietie scolastie, or A.r.E. Schooling is mandatory and universal between the ages of 5 and 14, and most schools in the country serve all ages between these years. All schools in Vekllei, aside from a half-dozen religious schools, are coeducational and operated directly by the A.r.E.\nAll institutions of higher learning, including universities, trade schools and adult education, are structured under the A.r.E.. School uniforms informed by traditional dress are provided and worn from preschool through to university, and faculty staff also often wear them.\nVekllei\u0026rsquo;s school enrolment is among the highest in the world, though this calculation includes untraditional and labour schools, including agricultural and maritime schooling.\nInfrastructure Sunny morning at the Ou Hydroburo Complex in Ou. | The Ou Hydroburo Office  If Vekllei is hesitant towards formal recognition of socialist aspects within its economy, in its infrastructure those concerns are discarded entirely. Vekllei is a midcentury state of nationalised infrastructure, led by grand modernist visions of progress and affluence. When combined with Upen\u0026rsquo;s spiritual emphasis on physicality and permanence, Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s affection for monuments of utility and public works are shown to be deeply embedded in the Vekllei national political spirit.  Unlike manufacturing and general industry, public infrastructure in the country is almost entirely monopolised by the government Utilities (A.r.Un.) and Construction (A.r.Lo.) state requisites, organs in Vekllei analogous to nationalised government industry. Infrastructure consistently ranks among Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s greatest national expenditure, with trillions of Kroner each year poured into projects across the country.\nMost large infrastructure projects, including transport, education, health, military and extraterrestrial interests, are completed in cyclical phases similar to Soviet half-decade plans, including production quotas and hard deadlines for completion. This system of construction has allowed the country to recover quickly from its devastation in the Atomic War and develop one of the most comprehensive public infrastructure systems in the world. Vekllei is a major transport hub for international flights and Atlantic ocean crossings, served largely by the Vekllei International Jetport and the historic Port of Vekllei respectively.\nTransport ‚ùñ Read more: Railways in Vekllei  Most Vekllei people do not own private autos, though they are available. Only 6% of the population possesses a driver license, and so most Vekllei people are dependent on the free and comprehensive network of transit systems that link settlement in the island, including trains of various guages, maglevs, trams, trolley busses, ferries, canal steamers, helijets, jets and light aircraft.\nVekllei has one of the highest density rail networks in the world, with some 14,000 kilometres of rail of various gauges. Trains vary from maglev hypertrains that connect Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Five Crown Cities to steam locomotives still in use for cultural reasons in the Home Island\u0026rsquo;s rural interior. Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s smallest rail gauge used in commercial service spans fifteen inches, and is commonly found in mountainous local service. Vekllei simultaneously has the oldest passenger locomotives in regular service in the world alongside some of the newest, including regular overhauls and innovations in maglev and bullet train types.\nThe Vekllei coast is ringed by various rail types, including the Coastal Bullet Train Network and a series of fast trams. A coastal highway, known as Motorway One, links Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s single continuous neighbourhood by road. Motorways are not generally speed limited in Vekllei.\nFor most Vekllei people, automobiles are accessed via autopools, shared vehicle depots that operate like rental cars for trips not easily made via public transit. Licenses are required to drive, though this is rarely enforced and few drivers renew their licenses, especially outside of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s urban centres.\nVekllei has five state air carriers, which constitute a government monopoly on all air travel in the country. The international flag carrier is Vekllei Overseas Airways, which serves air routes internationally with a fleet of various aircraft, including nuclear monowings and supersonic jets.\nHousing All real estate in Vekllei is negotiated, purchased and leased at a municipal level. Vekllei depends heavily on stewardship as a factor of ownership. Free homes are rented on an open market and are awarded via a complicated interview process rife with favouritism, mitigated by the mandatory circulation of real estate agents around Vekllei. The more time a landholder spends working a property, the larger their portion of ownership over it grows. If the children of a landholder continue to live in the house, they will continue to own it, and the stronger their proportion of ownership will become.\n He who works and lives above the shop, owns the shop\n \u0026ndash; Welcome to Vekllei, Handbook to the Atlantic, 2023\nUnusually, in Vekllei land has rights and owns itself, and human ownership is more or less a contract with that land. The borough positions itself as an intermediary. All land is, at its foundation, owned by the Landscape Sovereign; \u0026ndash; in other words, the land itself through Upen metaphysics.\nIn practice, land ownership is portioned between several different things depending on their relationship to that land. The borough has a monopoly, but most Vekllei people \u0026ldquo;own\u0026rdquo; their houses. All buildings are built by an architect with contracts from the municipality and the client. It would be nearly impossible for the Vekllei state to evict someone who has lived and worked land for generations, but a borough can intervene on the behalf of landscape or the structure if it\u0026rsquo;s being damaged.\nReal estate is also used as compensation for difficult jobs. Doctors are usually housed close to their place of work in nice apartments built for that purpose. Most people who \u0026ldquo;rent\u0026rdquo; in Vekllei are in this situation, where their house depends on their work. Usually, after a certain amount of time, they naturally wrest ownership away from the company (although in common good faith the property is officially gifted). Another good example is submariners, who have good real estate near Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s naval bases. This post mentions Ayn now owns her home from her work after a decade of service.\nVekllei\u0026rsquo;s borough municipalities maintain a monopoly on real estate purchase in the country, although the national government and high court retain the right of compulsory acquisition. Most neighbourhoods are planned by municipal architects, leading some to call Vekllei an \u0026lsquo;architocracy\u0026rsquo;. Homes in planned neighbourhoods are often awarded via a lottery system in places of high demand, or are otherwise floated freely on the market. It is common for housing to be dependent on employment, especially in the Capital Region, and real estate often forms part of viede compaszion, or \u0026lsquo;life compensation,\u0026rsquo; which is how most business in Vekllei rewards labour.\nLand ownership is common and usually proven by stewardship. Place-metaphysics in Upen also portion ownership between multiple agents simultaneously; the municipality, the land itself, architecture and the homeowner may all share ownership over land, awarded by common interest, community and utility. Although this muddies a traditional understanding of property, all homes in Vekllei are de facto owned by their residents, except in certain professions.\nHomes are also commonly inherited in Vekllei. All Vekllei people are guaranteed a right to home and property under the Petticoat Constitution. Some 92% of adults own their residence in Vekllei.\nCommunications Tzipora races a Royal Mail rural mail train to its next stop. | Racing the Post Office to the Station  ‚ùñ Main article: Post in Vekllei  The Royal Mail of Vekllei is the postal service of the country, and counts among its oldest surviving institutions. Founded in 1422, its origins as a military communications organ manifest today in its contemporary designation as a military state requisite, rather than civilian postal carrier. Despite this, the Royal Mail remains thoroughly civilian in its oversight and practice, and delivers around 50 million mail pieces a day in peak periods, including courier work abroad.\nTelephones, telegrams and videophones are structured under the Mail as the Office of Telecommunications, which acts as an independent organ of the Mail A.r.\nPower \u0026amp; Water Utilities are provided for by the national Thunderburo (the Hydro, Geo, Nuclear-Electric Commissions) and the Hydroburo (Water Commission) across the country, which were reestablished upon independence in 2015, both managed as proper bureaus of majority government ownership. Vekllei operates sixteen nuclear power plants, but most nuclear energy is sold to Europe via undersea cables. All domestic electricity is supplied by Geothermal power plants and Hydroelectric dams for political and religious reasons, making Vekllei one of the only countries of its size to rely exclusively on renewable energy supply for residential and commercial services.\nVekllei has the cleanest drinking water in the world, supplied by the country\u0026rsquo;s interior freshwater glaciers. Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s Hydroburo is also responsible for sewerage treatment and processing in the country.\n","permalink":"https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/","title":"Vekllei"}]
