      <description>🌺 Note from the Editor
This article was originally published in October 2019.  👒 Landscape in the Age of Frustration: Waugh’s Handful of Dust as Anti-Utopia #  Hobart Phillips #   Waugh&amp;rsquo;s A Handful of Dust has remarkable topography. The word can be extrapolated in this case in several ways; for one, the book is occupied by worldly, secular affairs, inextricably bound to a particular cultural landscape and absence of metaphysic.</description>

This article was originally published in October 2019.  🇭🇰 Not Long in Hong Kong #  Hobart Phillips #   Hong Kong is a loud, bustling jewel of a city. It is perhaps my favourite city in the world. On sweltering days, what sounds like raindrops smack the pavement as hundreds of air-conditioning units drip liquid into the streets below. In North Point, you might as well be fifty years back in time.</description>

      <description>🌺 Note from the Editor
This article was originally published in December 2018. Yes, it’s painfully self-concerned and a little painful to read back, but for newcomers to the project you might find some “obvious truths” about Vekllei you have not yet encountered.  🗼 A Cashless Tokyo #  Hobart Phillips #   I did not come to Tokyo to find a reference for the Petticoat Project, because utopia does not exist there for me.</description>
