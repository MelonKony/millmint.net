    <p><strong>Tzipora Desmoisnes</strong> (also <em>Zelda lo Ula de Helette Desmoisnes</em>, born May 5 2047) is a Vekllei <a href="docs/landscape/gregori.md">Gregori Baby</a> and librarian, and is the <a href="/docs/MillMint/Intro/#three-utopias">character utopia</a> of the <a href="docs/author/petticoat.md">Petticoat Project</a>. Born to artist and political activist <a href="/docs/landscape/economy.md">Mette Sumoisnesn</a> and an unknown father, the family moved to Colombia when Tzipora was six months old. Her return to Vekllei as a teen-ager would mark her integration into Vekllei society and her diagnosis as Vekllei&rsquo;s first victim of Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome.</p>
<p>Tzipora is characterised by her intense disposition and conservative tastes, informed in part by her youth in Colombia and the United States. Although she is naturally self-sustaining and independent, she dearly loves her adoptive father <a href="docs/characters/baron.md">Baron Desmoisnes</a> and family friend <a href="docs/characters/ayn.md">Ayn Rumouisen</a>, and holds affectionate, close relationships with those important to her.</p>

<p>Tzipora struggles with shell-shock, which interferes with her sleep and is spurred by several triggers, including large dogs and lying on her chest. Her nervous behaviour manifests in various tics, most obviously pulling and rubbing of her clothes and nose. She is relatively unknown in Vekllei, except as an occasional medical curiosity, but is somewhat renowned internationally as the oldest surviving Gregori Baby.</p>
<p>After the American invasion of Colombia in 2057, Mette paid an education broker several thousands of pesos to arrange Tzipora’s education in California. Although Tzipora would graduate in 2061, she had lost contact with her mother and had lapsed on her education visa. Without an allowance and barred from legitimate work, she moved to Utah the same year in search of income.</p>
<p>After finding work as a maid and residence at a women’s shelter, Tzipora witnesses to much of the industrial unrest in Utah in the early 2060s. After being threatened and nearly murdered by strikebreakers for her tacit association with the United Mine Workers, at that time an illegal organisation, she met 
  <a href="docs/characters/baron.md">Baron Desmoisnes</a>, an agent of the Vekllei 
  <a href="docs/landscape/intelligence.md">Americas Bureau at National Intelligence</a>. In 2063, she would flee Utah under his advice and return to Vekllei as an expatriated citizen.</p>
<p>Since arriving in 
  <a href="/docs/millmint/vekllei/">Vekllei</a> at the age of 16, Tzipora has received two doctorates from Montre University and currently works as a community librarian in the small Montre village of Montre-Lola, where she is well-loved.</p>

<p>Mette became pregnant aged 22 during her revival as an underground sculpture artist. Unsure of whether she was ready to raise a child, she later returned home to her family home for the first time in six years on the advice of her friends. The following Autumn, Tzipora was born.</p>
<p>She was delivered at the Ro Maternity Clinic without a father, since Mette was involved with several partners at the time.</p>

  An illicit relationship

</h4>
<p>By early summer in 2060, Tzipora came to rely emotionally on John Suzak, her mathematics teacher. The intensification of her feelings for him culminated in July, when Suzak discussed taking her to Disneyland. Although nothing would come of these plans, they would come back to haunt Tzipora.</p>
<h4 id="school-pariah">
  School Pariah
  <a class="anchor" href="#school-pariah">#</a>
</h4>
<p>By August 2060, Suzak had been quietly reassigned by the school board and disappeared from classes soon after. His predation on students had been an open secret, and rumour of his lovers soon focused on one of his students, a sixteen-year-old named Sue Jacobson. Suspicion was raised further by Jacobson&rsquo;s absence from classes in the month following Suzak&rsquo;s departure, leading to speculation by her peers that she had run off with him. By the time Jacobson returned to school in September, she found herself the subject of intense ridicule and gossip.</p>
<p>Although Jacobson was never sure of who Suzak&rsquo;s other girlfriends were, her friend Dolly told her that Tzipora, with whom she shared a dorm, had visited Disneyland with him in August. Hoping to distract attention from herself, Jacobson told peers that Tzipora had fallen pregnant while vacationing with him at Disneyland, which was why she&rsquo;d been in the hospital. Although it was a preposterous fabrication, and Tzipora had never been to Disneyland or so much as kissed a boy, she was already regarded as a loser among her classmates and the rumour quickly stuck.</p>
<p>Even though most quietly considered Jacobson to have been Suzak&rsquo;s illicit lover, Tzipora was an easy target and much of the ridicule was directed towards her. Although public bullying quickly settled in the weeks following, most of her classmates would never quite see Tzipora the same way. Worst of all, the rumour had spread throughout her year and the school, and had poisoned most people&rsquo;s impressions of Tzipora before they&rsquo;d met her. Tzipora, for her part, struggled to defend herself &ndash; she&rsquo;d never been to Disneyland, and had never been pregnant, but it was true that she&rsquo;d had a crush on Suzak. The grain of truth was enough to falter her confidence in defence.</p>
<p>Tzipora failed most of her exams in October, in part because of the stress the incident with Suzak had caused her. After her mother failed to return her letters sent in early December, Tzipora was rapidly becoming convinced that she was now alone in the world.</p>
<h4 id="a-physical-toll">
  A Physical Toll
  <a class="anchor" href="#a-physical-toll">#</a>
</h4>
<p>Around the time the bullying started, Tzipora fell ill from the stress. Although she would later remark that her visible tics were brought about by her time in Utah, the truth was that she first exhibited physical tics sometime during her experience in September-thru-November. Even when mildly anxious she would cover her speech with pulling and tugging on her shirt, and would wipe her nose with her fingers and hand incessantly.</p>

  Sue Jacobson&rsquo;s Arrest
  <a class="anchor" href="#sue-jacobsons-arrest">#</a>
</h4>
<p>In March, Dolly, who had told the falsehood about Tzipora and Suzak going to Disneyland, had a falling out with Sue Jacobson. Shortly after, when confronted about lying about Jacobson in class, Dolly let slip that it was Jacobson who was the liar, as Jacobson had lied about Tzipora&rsquo;s pregnancy in the first place. This information made its way back to Tzipora, whose bewilderment at the mundanity of Jacobson&rsquo;s reasoning quickly transformed into rage.</p>
<p>Although powerless to act out her revenge fantasies, Tzipora kept a close eye on everything Jacobson did from then on. Then, in May, shortly after Tzipora&rsquo;s 14th birthday, an opportunity presented itself.</p>
<p>One week to the day after Tzipora&rsquo;s birthday, Jacobson left her schoolbag behind in the classroom while the class changed for gym class. Tzipora, who had received permission from the nurse to sit out activities, quickly seized on her absence and began rummaging through her belongings, looking for something to steal or destroy. She came across Jacobson&rsquo;s diary, which, among other things, mentioned Jacobson&rsquo;s involvement with a book club run by her cousin. Taking note of the names in her contacts and looking to cause trouble, Tzipora placed an anonymous tip with the police that a girl in her class was organising communist support among the students.</p>
<p>Unknown to Tzipora was that the book club in question occasionally circulated banned literature, and an investigation the day after the call revealed anarchist works hidden in Sue&rsquo;s dorm. Sue Jacobson, her cousin, three other girls from St Mary&rsquo;s and six other people in total were arrested in the weeks following. Most, Sue among them, were sentenced to 8 years in prison after an investigation by the House Committee for Unamerican Activities. Six months later, in November, John Suzak would also be arrested in connection to the circulation of terrorist works.</p>
<p>Tzipora, terrified by her actions and that she might be implicated, found herself concerned for her safety. Unable to contact her mother and with her school debt due in June, Tzipora began to make plans to pool the last of her money and travel back to Colombia, hopefully finding her mother there.</p>

<p>Tzipora first met Baron Desmoisnes in May, just before her 16th birthday. He ran a bookshop on the outskirts of Cherry, nestled on a business street between the Greenwood and Salt Flats subdivisions.</p>
