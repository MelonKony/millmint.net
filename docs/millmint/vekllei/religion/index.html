  1. Overview
  <a class="anchor" href="#1-overview">#</a>
</h2>
<div id="intro">
<b><i>Upen</b></i> is the nondenominational animistic spiritualism of Vekllei. It is both an organised religious belief system and a decentralised local animism, localised regionally across the Home Islands and beyond. As a basis for Vekllei metaphysics and general belief systems, <i>Upen</i> is a central part of Vekllei cultural identity and informs most parts of life at all levels in the country.
</div>
<p><span class="fc">U</span>
pen is the animistic, nondenominational dominant and historical religion of Vekllei. Practiced commonly throughout the Home Islands and Vekllei&rsquo;s possessions, it is a core component of Vekllei culture and heritage, and has existed in various forms for thousands of years. Because <em>Upen</em> is fundamentally provincial and decentralised, its scripture and practice vary significantly between boroughs. Most forms emphasise object animism, impermanence, petite materialism, land dependence, existentialism and fear of nature.</p>
<p>Upen can be practiced at natural shrines, usually designated by a cairn, at running or still water, or the seaside. Maritime living and seafood are important aspects of Vekllei life, and fishing and ocean myths are key elements in <em>Upen</em>. Within its spiritualism, traditional folk-tales and scripture are called <em>sagas</em>, which have also archived much of Vekllei&rsquo;s early history.</p>
<p>Although traditionally atheist, <em>Upen</em> is commonly adopted by immigrant populations that include Catholic, Jewish and Buddhist faiths. In these contexts, <em>Upen</em>&rsquo;s animism and dependence on landscape is held alongside traditional beliefs, which are so common postwar that both Jewish and Catholic metaphysics have appeared in mainstream <em>Upen</em> doctrine in some cities, where large immigrant populations reside.</p>
<h3 id="introduction">
  Introduction
  <a class="anchor" href="#introduction">#</a>
</h3>
<p>You can find <em>Upen</em> all around you in Vekllei since, by its own spiritual metaphysics, animism is not human. It exists independently of human understanding or spirit, and <em>Upen</em> is merely the practice by which humans are cognisant and interact with the spirit of things. Wherever people and material existence collide, including man-made objects, you find <em>Upen</em>.</p>
<p>In this sense, <em>Upen</em> can be understood as having two distinct forms, practiced differently depending on the occasion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public <em>Upen</em>, which involves priests, communities, ceremony and cultural artefacts (like 
  <a href="/docs/millmint/vekllei/language/#25--upotenne"><em>Upotenne</em></a> and 
  <a href="/docs/millmint/vekllei/language/#23--rapotenne"><em>Rapotenne</em></a>). Public <em>Upen</em> manifests similarly to other faiths, in which sites of worship, historical texts and sacred spaces inform practice and understanding.</li>
<li>Private <em>Upen</em>, which involves personal understanding and direct physicality with the aspects of material being <em>Upen</em> holds sacred, namely the spirit of all things and the human form.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although <em>Upen</em> does retain priests informally, it lacks a hierarchical structure and is largely agnostic towards organised religion, lived and practiced instead through traditions, folklore, lifestyle and metaphysics.</p>

  2. Etymology
  <a class="anchor" href="#2-etymology">#</a>
</h2>
<p><span class="fc">U</span>
pen as a word has its origins lost to time, but its linguistic characteristics can be found throughout modern Vekllei language. <em>U</em> (pronounced &lsquo;oo&rsquo;) is a prefix applied to matters of consciousness considered sacred or special, as replicated in the spirit-language of 
  <a href="/docs/millmint/vekllei/language/#6-upotenne"><em>Upotenne</em></a>. <em>Upen</em> likely has origins in a proto-<em>Islandi</em> language called <em>Kala</em>, which later was absorbed into <em>Topyas</em>, the predecessor to 
  <a href="/docs/millmint/vekllei/language/">Vekllei</a>.</p>
<p>In modern usage, <em>Upen</em> refers to both the faith and metaphysic of Vekllei&rsquo;s local animism, as well as a general indicator for Vekllei faith, myth and traditional folklore.</p>

he practice of <em>Upen</em> varies dramatically between communities and persons, and its emphasis on nature is understood and practiced in different ways.</p>

<p><em>Upen</em>, as atheistic and animistic, shelters the landscape from becoming ‘simply nature’, as it does when viewed as a product of a monotheistic creator god. Within Vekllei&rsquo;s &lsquo;landscape&rsquo; agnosticism, nature is not ‘simply nature’; it is a spiritual vessel in itself, inalienable and inextricably linked to human purpose and satisfaction. Industry is divorced from the whole concept; it is a country of forest commons, collective stewardship, and volcanic unrest.</p>
<h3 id="product-atheism">
  Product atheism
  <a class="anchor" href="#product-atheism">#</a>
</h3>
<p><em>Atismoprodarte,</em> lit. “product atheism,” is the process by which Vekllei culture breaks down and rebuilds social preconceptions of objects, including products. Vekllei does not really have <strong>commodities</strong> in the traditional idea of the word, so it is supplemented here by ‘<strong>product</strong>,’ which more closely resembles the Vekllei word for commodity-forms: <em>prodart</em> or <em>prodatte</em>. This concept is a part of <em>Upen</em>, which is found throughout Vekllei culture and its constitution, and coexists agnostically with organised religion.</p>
<p>“Product Atheism” is the term for how Vekllei people think about the objects that make up their lives — clothes, appliances, toys, trinkets and treasures. These things are not quite commodities, because they are not “sold”. Vekllei does not use money, and so it does not produce items of any economic value.</p>
<p>An object’s economic form, then, is replaced by social form. Among Marxists, they call these social forms <em>fetishistic</em>, because products are given lives of their own and exist independently of the labour that created them. But this doesn’t work in Vekllei, because</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Labour-value is social, not economic.</strong> Vekllei people are not paid for work and they do not pay money for products. All work is for social reasons; all consumption is for social needs. Any object that is prohibited from the ordinary Vekllei person is merely landscape; it has no form.</li>
<li><strong>Labour-value is simultaneously suppressed, in imitation of commodity, and celebrated, in imitation of dereification.</strong> Vekllei shops look like any foreign shops, because they participate in the same fantasy ritual of shopping and allow easy access to products. At the same time, <em>Upen</em> emphasises the importance of local consumption and objects made by hand, and so Vekllei appliances are generally hand-made. This creates a social bond between the producer and consumer, and breaks down commodity-form, but it can’t escape the fetishised valuations encouraged by the consumer-fantasy. So it is neither a social or economic product while being both; resulting in a permanent contradiction.</li>
</ol>

</h2>
<p>Vekllei is a deeply superstitious country, a fact that informs political policy and personal belief alike.</p>
<p>First are <em>spirits</em> and <em>sprites</em>, which are the souls and fabric of the forests and hills. They are as old as the Earth itself and predate humans by billions of years, a fact that seems implied when you are joined in physical presence with them. They treasure, and indeed, embody the Earth and can reap wealth or chaos among us. Spirits take many forms, sometimes anthropomorphic, sometimes only partially corporeal. This one here has collected jewellery, gold, and peratin leaves, as they are fiercely attracted to precious metals. Just as we dress up for them, peaceful spirits will dress up for us and mimic parts of our bodies. <em>Sprites</em> (as opposed to spirits) are smaller, more emotional, and are fragments of reproduction &ndash; think of them like spores of ferns, of the pollen of flowers. You can see a small one floating beside the spirit.</p>
<p><em>Christ</em> was the first and only time that God is recorded to have walked among the living. He might visit the spirit world often; Tzipora wouldn’t know. As a creator and guide for humans, He was born as a human and taught ways to live well. Humanity is very young and is still learning to live on the Earth. The ritual of communion is a way of reminding us that We are in His image, and We are unworthy. He died for our sins; sins Tzipora is very sure will eventually usurp Him altogether in whatever deicidal sci-fi utopia she&rsquo;s got going on in her head.</p>
<p>Then, there are <em>humans</em> themselves. Here, Tzipora is in full costume designed for religious ceremony to talk to spirits. 
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/8lqzuj/the_dress_code_for_talking_to_spirits/">You can read more about the costume here</a>. She might ask for rains, or a long summer, or for the forest to return a missing child. Food offerings are presented. She forms a whole rune with her body as part of <em>Upotenne</em>, or the language of spirits. <em>Upotenne</em> itself is an ancient type of <em>Potenne</em>, which is modern Vekllei sign language. This is a calming rune, indicating maternal affection, and you can see the written hieroglyph appears visually similar to the pose.</p>
<p>Finally, demons walk the Earth and can manifest in many different ways. This one has taken the form of a girl, and carries the severed head of a goat. Its eyelids are painted with ritualistic eyes in mockery of proper funeral rites. They often wander aimlessly through uninhabited areas, as noise in intolerable to most demons. They are mysterious creatures, and their purpose is unknown. They come from the place spirits go to die. Like apex predators, they wander aimlessly and without purpose, hunting and feeding at random. They are feeble in physical forms, with one exception: they can form physical runes quickly and maliciously. The one cast here is an omen of suffering (translated literally as &lsquo;harpoiseanin&rsquo;, or overpowering the body with its own stomach acids). In Vekllei, a &lsquo;demon&rsquo; is any biplanar or otherwise supernatural creature that takes corporeal form and harms folk directly. Spirits can maim and kill, but only through the forces of nature &ndash; a demon attacks physically. There are many types of demons, 
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/97sckc/old_dead_demons_still_wander_the_countryside/">and you can read more about them here</a>.</p>
