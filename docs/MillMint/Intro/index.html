  What is this project?

</h2>
<p><strong>Vekllei is supposed to be an &lsquo;epoch of rest&rsquo;</strong>. It&rsquo;s a project that&rsquo;s become very big, with a long storyline and lots of characters, but at its heart this world is about peaceful escapism and whimsical nostalgia.</p>
<p>Vekllei is a &lsquo;worldbuilding&rsquo; project, which means it doesn&rsquo;t always look like a traditional storytelling endeavour. It introduces parts of an imaginary place that might not be revealed in a traditional linear story.</p>
<p>Vekllei is also a &lsquo;utopian&rsquo; project, which means that it&rsquo;s a form of <em>social dreaming</em>. It&rsquo;s a fantasy built out of the stresses and problems of the present, and so even if Vekllei people might not <em>talk</em> like you or <em>look</em> like you, there&rsquo;s a chance some part of this world may feel like you do.</p>
<p>This means that all sorts of themes and influences show up in my work. Vekllei has the 
  <a href="docs/landscape/language.md">language</a> of French-Chinese spoken with an Australian accent, a 
  <a href="docs/landscape/people.md">native people</a> of mixed Inuit-Scandinavian descent, and a modern industrial society that&rsquo;s

<ol>
<li>This place is <strong>iterative</strong> &ndash; canon disappears, people change appearance and the systems of Vekllei twist and turn as I do.</li>
<li>This place is <strong>good-spirited</strong> &ndash; Vekllei is escapism, and although the dark accompanies the light, this project is supposed to be calming and fun.</li>
<li>This place is <strong>constantly expanding</strong> &ndash; I try out new styles, mediums and methods of distribution all the time. Some of them work, some of them don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m looking to start a comic and make an animated trailer for the project, so stay tuned for that!</li>

  Three Utopias
  <a class="anchor" href="#three-utopias">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Vekllei is <strong>place</strong>, but it&rsquo;s also a <strong>people</strong>, created by 
  <a href="/docs/author/about/">Hobart</a>. In this sense, there are three utopias in this project, along which posts are categorised.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Author</strong> &ndash; essays, reflection and discussion</li>
<li><strong>Landscape</strong> &ndash; guides, diagrams and analysis</li>
<li><strong>Character</strong> &ndash; stories, moments and memories</li>
</ul>
<p>So what does &lsquo;utopia&rsquo; mean? It’s latin for “no place”. It&rsquo;s a forgotten history, a missed opportunity &ndash; a perfect place to escape to. It&rsquo;s a dream facing our past.</p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/roadtrip.jpg" alt="Vekllei kids on road trip" /></p>
<p>Vekllei is a very good place to live, but <strong>it is not perfect</strong>. Although many utopias are presented as perfect Edens of Earth, Vekllei is <em>utopie concreté</em>. It is a <em>dirty utopia</em> full of the inconveniences, inefficiencies and heartbreak of reality. The idea of my utopia, then, is to settle the bad things of life in a beautiful framework.</p>
<p>Utopia is a form of <em>social dreaming</em>, much like worldbuilding, linked to the values and priorities of its author. In utopian studies, “utopia” is usually broken down further:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eutopia —</strong> “good place”</li>
<li><strong>Dystopia —</strong> “bad place”</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that both form a part of the “utopia” — this is appropriate, since Vekllei is grounded in a social realism that acknowledges the good and bad parts of life. Indeed, they are inseparable — you cannot have the light without the dark. Such is the internal contradiction of any good utopia.</p>
<h3 id="utopia-as-author">
  Utopia as Author
  <a class="anchor" href="#utopia-as-author">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The project is the creation of an <strong>Author</strong>, the producer of the whole thing. The creative and personal products are theirs, as unique as a fingerprint. They most likely produce a lot of different societies and characters in trying to tell a story, or flesh out an idea they’ve had — but for the purposes of the idea of an <em>epoch of rest</em>, there are two perfect utopias: <strong>landscape</strong> (society and the world), and
<strong>character</strong> (personality and appearance). In this sense, the author is the genesis of the utopia.</p>
<h3 id="utopia-as-landscape">
  Utopia as Landscape
  <a class="anchor" href="#utopia-as-landscape">#</a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Utopias of landscape</strong> (the <em>topos</em>) are the stuff you traditionally associate with the utopian tradition &ndash; these are utopias of place. They include utopian cities, states, economies, machines, and any part of local physicality. When I talk about <em>landscape</em>, I use it in one of two ways.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Landscape</strong> as it refers to physical space, like cities, woodlands and oceans.</li>
<li><strong>Landscape</strong> as it refers to the human metaphysic of place &ndash; the way we build and identify physical spaces in our mind. For example, most people today distinguish between &lsquo;the city&rsquo; and &lsquo;nature&rsquo;. In Vekllei, they don&rsquo;t.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Vekllei</strong> is a country in which the external burdens of the
world can be shifted. Worries are relegated to the personal —
an arena in utopian fiction that conveniently still falls under
the domain of the author. In Vekllei, self-actualisation is
tangible, vivid, only metres away. It might be in creativity or
power or love, but it is attainable, because the economic and
cultural orchestra of the country is in the imagination of the
author, and so it is perfect as by definition of utopia.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="utopia-as-character">
  Utopia as Character
  <a class="anchor" href="#utopia-as-character">#</a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Utopias of character</strong> are what I call utopian premises of life experience; stuff you can&rsquo;t construct from stone and concrete. Character utopias make up for the limitations of utopian space by recognising and providing for a new utopian dimension &ndash; people, and personality. If the obsessive utopian can create imaginary communities from social dreams, why not people? Character utopias sum up an ideal life experience, personality, body and taste. 
  <a href="/docs/characters/tzipora/">Zelda</a> is one such character utopia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If Vekllei is the arena of external burden, <strong>Tzipora</strong> is a girl on
which the internal pressures of self-doubt and conscious flaw
are cast aside like a rag. In the sense of a narrative, Tzipora
might suffer because of her behaviours (her nervous tics, her
jealousy, her body and image), but they are adopted in a way
that is graceful. So despite her fierce problems, it fades away
in the fact that she will not die; she will not be unsuccessful;
she will not be unloved. As long as those core premises are
true, then every other nervous tic or obsessive-compulsive
behaviour are storytelling; window-dressing to an aesthetic
taste.</p>
</blockquote>

  Where to from here?
  <a class="anchor" href="#where-to-from-here">#</a>
</h2>
<p>My little &lsquo;epoch of rest&rsquo; is pretty much the only thing I enjoy doing. It&rsquo;s the melting pot of my whole life experience &ndash; from interest and hobbyism to ideology and insecurity. It&rsquo;s the sum of a worldview, a whole person, and to that end I think utopia is a powerful form of self-expression.</p>
<p>I plan to tell lots of stories in Vekllei in lots of different ways. This wiki is one of them &ndash; it allows me to fill out the world in a new format that better catalogues the scope of this project.</p>
<p>I also plan to start work on a comic in late October 2020, and in 2021 I intent to produce a short animated trailer for the project. You can follow me along on these adventures on 
  <a href="https://discord.gg/dCE6vSU">my Discord</a> or the

<p>Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy this adventure in dreaming.</p>

  F.A.Q.
  <a class="anchor" href="#faq">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s run through some frequently asked questions and common misconceptions about the project.</p>
<p><strong>Who are you?</strong></p>
<p>A Tasmanian illustrator.</p>
<p><strong>You’re not Japanese?</strong></p>
<p>お前はもう死んでいる</p>
<p><strong>Why is Vekllei a utopia?</strong></p>
<p>It makes me feel better about my life and the world. It’s escapism; it’s a dream.</p>
<p><strong>It’s a bit cringe to grandstand your political beliefs, doncha think?</strong></p>
<p>Vekllei is a personal utopia. That’s what I’m selling. At least you’re getting good opinions.</p>
<p><strong>Where’s the tension if it’s perfect?</strong></p>
<p>Vekllei is very cynical and tragic in places. Utopia is just a reflection of the author, good and bad.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a novel? A story? A comic?</strong></p>
<p>I’m working on a comic right now. I’m pretty much working on Vekllei full-time so I’m hoping to announce it soon. I’ve got a lot of different Vekllei projects going.</p>
<p><strong>Where is Vekllei?</strong></p>
<p>Iceland.</p>
<p><strong>Why does Vekllei look Japanese?</strong></p>
<p>Vekllei is like a country of Scandinavians speaking French with an Aussie accent in Shōwa era Japan/Maoist China/Taiwan etc. Vekllei looks however I imagine utopia looks.</p>
<p><strong>How does that make sense?</strong></p>
<p>Why can’t it just be cool?</p>
<p><strong>Is your alt-history thought out?</strong></p>
<p>Vekllei’s history is whatever I need it to be. I’m always trying to be realistic, but it’s all worked backwards from the setting. I’m not really “worldbuilding” in a typical sense. Very little of it is published, most of it is retrieved on request. Just ask if you have questions.</p>
<p><strong>Is Vekllei communist?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>But Vekllei calls itself “petticoat socialist”.</strong></p>
<p>Vekllei is set in a culture of Marxist revivalism in the 50s and 60s. A lot of Vekllei’s lexicon is set in that context. Vekllei is a decentralised democracy that doesn’t use money. It’s a sort of participatory economy.</p>
<p><strong>Why the &ldquo;petticoat&rdquo;?</strong></p>
<p>Vekllei is a female country. Womanhood is decommodified. It&rsquo;s maternal, social and friendly where socialist rhetoric is masculine, technocratic and progressive.</p>
<p><strong>Who is Zelda?</strong></p>
<p>Zelda is another name for Tzipora. She has two names specifically to confuse you.</p>
<p><strong>What is the “bulletin”?</strong></p>
<p>I publish the <em>Atlantic Bulletin</em> once a month via email. It’s got the month’s posts in it as well as facts and tidbits from Vekllei. DM me an email if you want to join.</p>
