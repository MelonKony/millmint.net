This article was originally published in October 2019. It offers an analysis of Evelyn Waugh&amp;rsquo;s Handful of Dust through an anti-utopian prism.👒Landscape in the Age of Frustration: Waugh’s Handful of Dust as Anti-Utopia #Hobart Phillips#Waugh&amp;rsquo;s A Handful of Dust has remarkable topography. The word can be extrapolated in this case in several ways; for one, the book is occupied by worldly, secular affairs, inextricably bound to a particular cultural landscape and absence of metaphysic.</description>

      <description>🌺 Note from the Editor
This article was originally published in October 2019.
