Utopia is a form of social dreaming, much like worldbuilding, linked to the values and priorities of its author. In utopian studies, ‚Äúutopia‚Äù is usually broken down further:\n Eutopia ‚Äî ‚Äúgood place‚Äù Dystopia ‚Äî ‚Äúbad place‚Äù  Note that both form a part of the ‚Äúutopia‚Äù ‚Äî this is appropriate, since Vekllei is grounded in a social realism that acknowledges the good and bad parts of life.

The word can be extrapolated in this case in several ways; for one, the book is occupied by worldly, secular affairs, inextricably bound to a particular cultural landscape and absence of metaphysic. Further, as a satirical novel of deep conservative utopian lament, there is a physical, temporal dimension to its present context and history. Finally, the topography of Waugh\u0026rsquo;s novel can be taken literally, as a landscape of modernity (cities) and counter-modernity (rural life), modernism (civilisation) and anti-modernism (savagery). Because of this, there is a playful relationship with Waugh\u0026rsquo;s anti-utopian world and his utopian instincts ‚Äî one that warrants closer analysis. This essay will focus on the dichotomous, often schismatic landscapes at play in A Handful of Dust, and situate it in a modern utopian framework.    It is easiest to understand A Handful of Dust in a utopian context when the reader first recognises the novel as a worldview, or as Edward Lobb1 calls it, a ‚Äùpicture of an entire society,‚Äù citing Waugh\u0026rsquo;s employment of Eliot\u0026rsquo;s Waste Land in its title and epigraph p.130. This scope is almost invariably unsentimental, especially in satirical works, and this quirk of genre is calcified into something more deliberate when looking at the novel‚Äôs literary context, which Peter Firchow recognised as a deliberate rejection of Victorian sentimentalism and moral arbitration as characterised by Dickensian literature2 p.415. The satirical edge of the novel‚Äôs climax is only shallowly buried; Nicholas Joost wrote that ‚Äúbeneath the incongruity, there is a chilling propriety. The relationship between Mr Todd and Tony is as Dickensian in kind and proportion as is that between Miss Havisham and Estella in Great Expectations.‚Äù3 p.186\nThe Waugh landscape is marked by unusual topography, where people and places are made foreign through their own alienation from purpose and time. Tony is a secular humanist (evidenced through his irreverence towards faith throughout the novel) dependent parasitically on the romantic nostalgia for the restrained way of life under the Judea-Christian tradition, without the metaphysic provided by pious faith1 p.133. Brenda is a modern woman attached socially and historically to London, the icon of modern (and Victorian) life, which informs her unfaithfulness and various missteps. In fact, nearly every character in the novel suffers from a kind of displacement of both place and intention, which in Waugh\u0026rsquo;s parody of a humanist framework forces a series of unfortunate events that unfold throughout. This all takes place, of course, in the tumultuousness of the interwar years, marked first by hedonism and excess in the 1920s and instability and poverty in the 1930s, the decade in which A Handful of Dust was written. H.G. Wells in his 1933 novel The Shape of Things to Come called it \u0026ldquo;The Age of Frustration,‚Äù for the vast cultural and political changes threatening an unravelling of the world. Waugh, like many of his fellow British authors (including Eliot, Orwell, and Wells himself), hedged existential concerns about the state of his homeland in his work.\nA Handful of Dust is distracted from pure reactionary critique by the (in his mind) far more egregious severing of morality from the metaphysic, and the adoption of previously Judeo-Christian ethics by secular, ungrounded humanist movements. Tony is estranged from real spiritual purpose or existential satisfaction by his secularity and passivity. He spends most of the novel surprised and wounded by sharp moments of tragedy only to be utterly unequipped to deal with them in his total vacuum of Self. In fact, his worldview is less an empty epistemological constellation than it is a fog where no stars or points of reference are visible at all. This culminates, of course, in his ironic fate, in which his old material life essentially reasserts itself in an absurd parody, where his fake, superficial Dickensian existence is resumed against his will in the jungles of Brazil. Quite literally, to Lobb, ‚Äúhis reading of Dickens is a reversion to Victorian sentimentality‚Äù1 p.135, concluding spatially in the same meaningless fantasy as his life at Hetton Abbey.\nSuch is the Waugh‚Äôs illustration of the world in the Age of Frustration, and his fundamental alienation from it. The novel contains not merely glimpses of anti-utopias, but in fact presents a particular anti-utopian philosophy, which can be inverted to better clarify the images of utopia present throughout the work. For example, even though the novel has clear misgivings about the state of England in the late 1930s, the utopian foundation on which A Handful of Dust is built upon nonetheless participates in a philosophy of place, gesturing towards a conservative progression of history. After all, it is not just the revolutionary that understands history as an arc of progress ‚Äî liberals and conservatives alike recognise the horizon, but disagree on the changes made to meet it. Walter Benjamin illustrated this idea cleanly in 1940:\n Progress, as it was painted in the minds of the social democrats, was once upon a time the progress of humanity itself (not only that of its abilities and knowledges). It was, secondly, something unending (something corresponding to an endless perfectibility of humanity). It counted, thirdly, as something essentially unstoppable (as something self-activating, pursuing a straight or spiral path).4 pp.9-10\n Waugh‚Äôs conservatism in a utopian context thus reveals interesting temporal locations through the framework built by sociologist Karl Mannheim. Conservatism, and to a lesser extent liberalism, are fundamentally \u0026ldquo;socially congruent\u0026rdquo; utopias (as opposed, Mannheim supposes, to the socially transcendent topos of the radical and anarchic). White5 expands on this classification, explaining that the differences among utopian sectors \u0026ldquo;are matters more of emphasis than of content,‚Äù since all are fundamentally agents of change p.25. All utopias are efforts to envision and manifest a shift in politics or culture, either consciously in praxis or unconsciously as a collection of values and ideas. Under White\u0026rsquo;s summary, conservatives (to whom Waugh undeniably belongs) are \u0026ldquo;inclined to imagine historical evolution as a progressive elaboration of the institutional structure that currently prevails,\u0026rdquo; where anarchic/radical utopias tend to treat utopia as a non-temporal phenomena that is essentially timeless, dependent only on man\u0026rsquo;s ability to wrest control of their own humanity. Thus is the distinction between ideology and utopia in the inversion characteristic of Mannheim\u0026rsquo;s definitions, where ideology proves socially useful but practically impossible, and utopia is necessary in genuine social change as an element whose \u0026ldquo;ideas and values in which are contained in condensed form the unrealised and the unfulfilled tendencies which represent the needs of each age.\u0026quot;5 p.179 It marks a break from the lineage of utopia\u0026rsquo;s etymology from More\u0026rsquo;s original Utopia. Particularly relevant to Waugh\u0026rsquo;s work here is utopia as a practicable element of social change, as Mannheim writes6 p.178 \u0026ldquo;the road of history leads from one topia over a utopia to the next topia, etc.\u0026rdquo;\nWith Mannheim\u0026rsquo;s redefinition in mind, it is important to assert A Handful of Dust\u0026rsquo;s place in this epistemology. Phillip Wegner notes that the four utopian mentalities outlined by Mannheim (conservative, liberal, radical, and anarchic) are in fact present within their own \u0026ldquo;mode of historical consciousness,\u0026rdquo; existing independently while \u0026ldquo;representing a critical \u0026lsquo;counter-utopia\u0026rsquo; to its three competitors\u0026rdquo; 7 p.192. In this sense, Waugh\u0026rsquo;s conservative utopia is less a concrete set of values and principles than it is a device for clarifying the horizons of political imagination, dynamically reacting to and reflecting the other three corners of possibility.\nYou can see these possibilities through the further inversion of the anti-utopia, like the cyclical nature of faithless humanism. In the case of Tony, the interjection of reality into his absurd fantasy results in an eternity of Hetton-style superficiality manifested literally through Victorian moralism. John Beaver, still materialistic and dependent on his ‚Äúmumsy,‚Äù leaves Britain only to presumably carry on in decadence in Californiap.176. Brenda‚Äôs desire for excitement and romantic satisfaction, meanwhile, leave her alone in the city and without money to sponsor a colourful lifestyle (Characteristically, Waugh does not mince words: ‚ÄúIt was August and she was entirely alone,‚Äùp.193). By the end of the novel, in which the characters themselves are as unresolved as the arc of the story itself, it is clear that the spiritual emptiness that subsumes the purpose of these people is not merely thematic, but is in fact a clarified anti-utopia in itself, not as place but as ‚Äúbody utopias‚Äù 8 p.4. Or rather, anti-utopias of spiritual/sensual gratification. These are people who have no connection to anything fixed or meaningful in their own pasts or culture.\nThis reassessment of utopian writing acknowledges A Handful of Dust not as mere satire for satire‚Äôs sake, but as in fact a vessel of practicable ideas well within potentiality for a hypothetical conservative utopia. After all, should the interwar years have been marked by a series of different events, who is to say Britain might not have become marked at a national cultural level the kind of reactionary nostalgia visible in Waugh\u0026rsquo;s novel? It is not, after all, a simple utopia of place. Jean Ward9 p.679 describes the vision of the novel as a story of \u0026ldquo;human selfishness and self-delusion,\u0026rdquo; in contrast to a simpler misanthropic adventure of human misfortune. This characterisation better illustrates Waugh\u0026rsquo;s pointed absence of framework, or metaphysic, for the world depicted.\nAfter all, it is not as though people will cease to fall out of love, or commit adultery, or accidentally maim children in a world built upon Catholic social norms and the accompanying spiritual bedrock. Nor is it reasonable to suggest Waugh\u0026rsquo;s nostalgia for a pre-war (or pre-modern) England would be blind to the fact that human moral failure would continue to exist. But in the worldview of A Handful of Dust, the characters shown are merely symptomatic of a global cheapness, a sort of international hedonism, that is presented as a sort of era without end. Ann Slater10 notes the novel\u0026rsquo;s displacement of people and intention, citing a recurring motif in which a well-meaning or pleasurable thing is made bad and uncomfortable by its displacementpp.49-66. It is not difficult to find examples of this sardonic irony in the text; Brenda\u0026rsquo;s mourning of the wrong personp.118, and Tony\u0026rsquo;s ironic torturous imprisonment (which takes his pleasures and makes them agony)p.210 are just two examples. In fact, the instances of a correct sentiment or honest effort backfiring and causing trouble so thoroughly pervades the Waugh landscape that it becomes an indispensable part of its satirical edge, culminating in its ironic juxtaposition of life in London against Tony\u0026rsquo;s feverish delusions of the city in the jungle. As Slater notes:\n Civilisation and the savage world fuse. London turns into a desert for Brenda, once Beaver leaves for New York and the entire beau monde goes off cruising in the Mediterranean [\u0026hellip;] Tony, on the other hand, discovers that the bush at night is noisier than a city square.10 p.63\n This fusion of anti-utopian landscape, both as a wasteland composed of good intentions and a jungle of bad outcomes, is an interesting illustration of Waugh\u0026rsquo;s wider satirical targets in the novel. Despite ostensibly satirising the bankruptcy of modern life and its secular humanism, Waugh\u0026rsquo;s ruthless antisentimentality marks A Handful of Dust as a thoroughly modernist novel. Indeed, outside of the aesthetic framework provided by modernism (which Waugh, at least spiritually and politically, rejects), A Handful of Dust was one of many English novels documenting the social disintegration and futility of the modern world. As put by Jonathan Greenburg, ‚ÄúIn Waugh, the satiric and the modem often look very much alike; while the author may claim to satirise a decadent modernity, the disruptive mechanism of his satire fosters the very modem decadence he decries‚Äù11 p.352. The novel is at once a critique and a product of modernism. This dissonance was noted by his biographer as occurring shortly after his entry into the Catholic Church:\n Conversion meant that in one way Waugh had withdrawn from the world of meaninglessness, godlessness, and chaos, yet he remained passionately interested in it, with it if not spiritually or intellectually of it. He could confidently judge and condemn the world he described, but he would not turn away from it.12 p.76\n For Waugh, his conversion equipped him with a worldview that had already been formulating for some years. He was a great believer in the supernatural metaphysics of the Church as a place of order and stability12 p.76, and this would colour his personal politics as well as his personal writing, as well as condemn in his eyes the mortal and material desires of those without faith. A Handful of Dust is a work particularly relevant to his conversion, since an oft-cited quote of his declares the the novel ‚Äúwas humanist and contained all I had to say about humanism.‚Äù13 p.118. According to John Cunningham, ‚Äúin this novel he considered the dead end of a humanism that supposes one may have a moral purpose and yet have no metaphysic in which that purpose is grounded.‚Äùp.118. It was not just a humanist topography in which A Handful of Dust was situated, however. In understanding utopia as a function of place as well as form, it becomes clear that the anti-utopia of the novel is multidimensional, incorporating criticisms of topos as well as body.\nIn his seminal work on the origins of landscape and historicism, Karatani Kojin wrote, \u0026ldquo;in the very moment when we become capable of perceiving landscape, it appears to us as if it had been there, outside of us, from the start‚Äù14 p.34. So too does the iconography of \u0026ldquo;old England\u0026rdquo; illustrated in A Handful of Dust suppress its origins as landscape as soon as it is introduced. Most obviously, the \u0026ldquo;old country\u0026rdquo; of Hetton Abbey is expressed only in transcendental terms and is thoroughly defamiliarised. It is, in effect, not a place at all, but a sham landscape only supported by the value given to it by the Lasts (which further recalls Eliot‚Äôs poem in the epigraph; ‚ÄúThese fragments I have shored against my ruins‚Äù). To further draw on Karatani: ‚ÄúIt brings into existence landscapes which, although they had always been there, had never been seen\u0026quot;p.29. This then informs the ability of the novel to set within it subjects and objects of action, as it is important to recognise the subjects and objects of action arise from within a landscape upon discovery, rather than having existed as immutable factsp.34. Tony is thoroughly alienated from landscape as it is depicted in the novel; it is only appropriate, then, that he struggles to find an appropriate metaphysical foundation for his existence. The discovery of landscape predates modernism as Waugh understands it, but it remains in fact a modern creation brought about the artistic and religious reformations of centuries prior (namely protestant reformations, notable in context of Waugh\u0026rsquo;s catholicism). As described by Gleiter:\n The modern Self is indebted to a process of extraneation which is also a process of objectification. Both the landscape and the Self become alien and enigmatic, and these, precisely, are the qualities that made them visible.15 p.73\n Furthermore, Hetton Abbey is acknowledged as a Victorian Gothic reconstruction, a revivalist style that reflects his romantic fetishisation of the preindustrial and rural1 p.131. The investment of his spirit into an inauthentic commodity grotesquely acknowledges his spiritual bankruptcy, which cascades into all parts of his delusions (his inability to respond to the death of his son and his wife\u0026rsquo;s unfaithfulness, etc.). Firchow describes Hetton as ‚Äúroughly from the same period of Dickens‚Äô novels; both seem to represent the last gasping certainties of an old order. And both, by implication, are possibly intended to be recognised as shams‚Äù2 p.415. Even his response to grief is filtered through this plastic understanding of the world, as Tony exclaims, ‚ÄúA whole Gothic world had come to grief.., there was now no armour, glittering in the forest glades, no embroidered feet on the greensward; the cream and dappled unicorns had fled\u0026hellip;\u0026ldquo;p.147.\nThe reconfiguring of landscape as iconography also enables Waugh to further satirise the characters of the novel, and strip back their agency as a consequence of their own hedonism. Brenda is suffocated socially by Tony‚Äôs blind love for the Abbey; Tony is trapped by Mr Todd in the Brazilian jungle; Mr Todd is trapped by his illiteracy, and so on. Indeed, the book concludes on a cage of silver foxes. Through their social and physical imprisonment, the people of the novel are better illustrated against both the hellish topos and their own critical character flaws that prevent them from breaking out of their cyclical lifestyles. Their spiritual emptiness is reflected in their ability to take the metaphysical institutions of life seriously, and renders them (socially and in their ability to enact change over their own lives) as children10 p.61. John Beaver, in his poverty and dependence on his mother, seems to typify this psychospiritual bankruptcy, but the patronising tone of the novel leaves few characters unmarked. Nowhere is this more apparent than when Jock finally presents the request regarding the importation of pork pies on behalf of his constituents, only to bungle the department to which he was supposed to address it. Waugh‚Äôs sardonic line encloses this caricature of the man: ‚ÄúJock left the House that afternoon with the comfortable feeling that he had at last done something tangible in the interest of his constituents‚Äù.p.216\nWith the intensity of the satirical edge in A Handful of Dust, it is only suitable that its anti-utopian foundations are expressed with great clarity. The defamiliarisation (and often outright absence of sympathy) for the people of this book only serve to better collapse the sort of Victorian sentimentalism to which Waugh seems averse. Just as Tony is isolated from sincere accomplishment of preindustrial, rural nobility by his time in history and material circumstance, so too are his metaphysical aspirations undermined by their baselessness. To the Catholic Waugh, the idea of morals without metaphysic is vacuous and empty of real substance. Similarly, Waugh‚Äôs perceived savagery embedded within civilisation is not just as a condemnation of changing cultural icebergs, but a literalist judgement of the products of modernists ‚Äî that is to say, modern people. Waugh presents a paper landscape and plastic people, and through a simple inversion it easy enough to pull genuine utopian social dreaming from this novel. Utopia undeniably exists in the conservative anti-utopia, and in the case of A Handful of Dust, it invokes a broader context of a unique period of time for British literature, one marked by material uncertainty and cultural retreat. For that reason, Waugh‚Äôs A Handful of Dust is an undeniably important work of fiction, both as a biting critique of modernism (which itself has long-since given way to later movements) and as a zeitgeist for conservative apprehension in a remarkable period of history.

Everyone is shouting, all of the time.\nEnough people have asked me to share my experience in Hong Kong that I‚Äôve decided to get around to doing it. I was reluctant for a few reasons. The first is that I felt I didn‚Äôt have anything particularly profound to say (it recalls white tourists returning home from building a cowshed in Vietnam and describing how seeing poverty really, like, made them grateful). The second was that there are enough Western voices telling us how to feel about police brutality and freedom movements, and I don‚Äôt see how my anecdotes would contribute to anything but further anxiety and sorrow for Hong Kong. I am not some kind of saviour, or for that matter a journalist. I did not do anything good for Hong Kong. I don‚Äôt see how I‚Äôve earned my right to talk about it. So treat this only as a collection of thoughts, influenced and calcified by my time in a wonderful city.\nDo not go to Hong Kong right now unless you‚Äôre willing to get hurt for it. These are not localised outbreaks of violence. In Tsim Sha Tsui, the trendy shopping heart of Hong Kong, I saw a female tourist carried out of a tear smoke plume by her partner. I next saw her laid out several streets away amidst protester paramedics. It can be difficult to tell which places are safe, even when trying to avoid or escape a protest. I had not realised I was across from a besieged police station when I first had a taste of tear smoke. I hadn‚Äôt seen the smoke warning flags or police lights.\nThe night after the events of TST, the police used tear smoke in an underground MTR station. It should not take an expert to realise why using chemical weapons in an enclosed, unventilated space is an escalation of police violence. Quite frankly, considering the scale of the protests and the hostility of the HK riot police, it is only chance that someone hasn‚Äôt been killed (or at least confirmed to be). Hong Kong is a gorgeous, wonderful city, but the risks are obvious and largely unavoidable.\nI recall running with some strangers to the corner of Haiphong and Nathan Road, where an MTR station was still operating, as three busses of riot police arrived and unloaded onto the pavement beside me. The protests on Nathan Road clearly hadn‚Äôt dispersed to their liking. I was there by chance, doing tourist things. They were carrying tear smoke guns and shields. It is very surreal to be surrounded by some of the most valuable commercial real estate in the world, stocked with Tiffany Blue gift boxes and BVLGARI fragrances, only to be racing riot police to the station entrance before the metro shut down. The following night, my hotel in North Point boarded up its doors in preparation of a riot between protesters and pro-Beijing counterprotesters. I hung around for a while, but it seemed the protesters were smart enough to avoid North Point that night. My point is that, after dark, tourist impulses to see sights and enjoy good food will lead you into an escalating civil disturbance that has been ongoing for nearly three months now.\nWhat are we, the world, supposed to do about Hong Kong? Just this week, protesters marched on the U.S. embassy waving American flags. What do they expect the Yanks to do? Appear off-shore with a aircraft carrier as a show of force? Despite the sacrifice of Hong Kongers at home and abroad, the dialogue still seems to be not of Hong Kong and her future, but of China. Even if every demand should be met, the ‚Äútwo systems, one country‚Äù promise will expire in a few decades, and what do we plan to do about it then? Dump more opium into China and demand Hong Kong back?\nDespite my unwavering solidarity with Hong Kongers and their struggle, I find myself reeling from the gloating of our media, on social networks and in print, over the grisly iconography of the protests. Crows and carrion, I say. We don‚Äôt really intend to do anything about it ‚Äî China could perpetrate another massacre and we‚Äôd only wring our hands about the incivility of it all. Who would we sanction the Chinese mainland from? Ourselves? We‚Äôve spent the entire post-war era comfortably offloading our manufacturing into the cheap, exploited labour markets of East Asia. Are we willing to sacrifice our entire manufacturing base over the blood of Hong Kongers?\nJournalists scribble. Social media lurkers like. Politicians wrestle with the reality that our mother country‚Äôs navy is no longer able to stomp about the world anymore. Even America, our World Police, seem to be flexing only their civil service ‚Äî intensifying bureaus and firing up cabinet meetings. So what are we, the world, supposed to do about Hong Kong?\nI watched thousands of Hong Kongers risk livelihoods and safety, only to return to the infantilising paternalism of Western commentary, with loaded notions of Hong Kong as a ‚ÄòWestern pocket‚Äô of Asia, flicking between sympathy theatre and condemnation of Beijing. It seems disingenuous and lurid, and although our free press is more decent about the matter than the Chinese state media could ever be (my Twitter in Hong Kong was sponsored exclusively by Chinese newspapers decrying the violence of protestors), it‚Äôs nonetheless uncomfortable for me to tout my own righteous, democratic superiority when all my morals and all my democracy leave me useless in the face of Chinese hegemony.\nIt‚Äôs left me burnt out and cynical in a way that tear smoke and street fires never could. There is spirit and vigilance in the protests in Hong Kong, but we live in a world of global trade and information overload. Hong Kong is very small place, and the world is very big. Our sympathy does the reality of the situation no good.\nHong Kong is not the tipping point ‚Äî Hong Kong is the first of an ongoing shift of power in our region. There will be more crises like Hong Kong, and our neutered ability to cohesively respond to them without drawing upon our supposed moral superiority is a weakness. China does not understand Western presence and commentary in Hong Kong as a democratic effort ‚Äî it sees it as the legacy of imperial ambition and colonial politics. How much of Australian shock and outcry is about reconciling our own powerlessness with our principles? What good is an opinion of the People‚Äôs Republic or of the HK police? We recognise the distastefulness and incivility of violence, but that does little to influence the imbalance of power spilling blood in Hong Kong right now.\nAwareness is not enough ‚Äî we‚Äôre only a few taps and two clicks away from live minute-by-minute updates of every tear shed in the ongoing protests. There are thousands of journalists in Hong Kong covering every angle of police brutality. And yet the violence goes on‚Ä¶\nThis is my announcement that I am, in fact, useless ‚Äî that for all my Australian pretensions of decency and agency, the situation has changed not one bit. I thus volunteer my honourable withdrawal from the Discourse. All I‚Äôll say is this:\nHong Kong is the first of many. Consider what Hong Kong means to you, and what you can do about it.\n"});index.add({'id':11,'href':'/docs/landscape/economy/','title':"Sundress Municipalism",'section':"Landscape",'content':"Under Construction\nThis page is still under construction, and may be incomplete.  The Vekllei Economy #  Sundress Municipalism #  1. Participatory Economics in Utopia #  1.1. Introduction #  The daily functioning of the Vekllei economy is as miraculous as it is unique. Key organs and mechanisms of the Vekllei economy reality are positioned against or outright opposed against each other. And a startling series of contradictions \u0026ndash; one after the other, each more unusual than the last. Vekllei is a planned economy; it is also a free market. Property ownership is obfuscated by portioned sovereignty of land and product. Decommodification has devalued products in a country based on manufacturing. There are many contradictions, inefficiencies and simply unusual mechanisms in the Vekllei domestic market, and this article hopes to elucidate at least some of them.\nThe Bureau System, sometimes called Product Socialism, is the name by which Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s economy is most often described. A primitive form was found in the anarchy in the wake of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s atomic bombing, but by 2020 it was written into the document that would become Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s postwar constitution.\n Prior to the Atomic War, Vekllei was a closed, protectionist market under rule of a monarchy puppeted by a military junta. A backwards and quaint country for much of its 20th century, there is no period in Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s history which we might describe as \u0026ldquo;industrial capitalism\u0026rdquo;. It is in this context, in the ashes of the Atomic War and under British occupation, that we can sympathise with the barter economy that would eventually modernise into the Bureau System, a thoroughly unique economic ideology in the world today.\n  What makes the Bureau System unique? Simply that, in common contexts, no money exists in Vekllei whatsoever. This is moneylessness in spirit, too \u0026ndash; there are no currency substitutes, be they labour vouchers or ration systems. This initial fact of life and symptom of destitution is now codified and vigorously defended by the Vekllei state, making the country the only example of a moneyless state of its size in the world.\nThe abolition of currency is allowed by two facts:\n1. A general post-scarcity and surplus of goods.  2. The inefficiencies of a profitless market compensated by the total abolition of waged labour/labour costs. The function fo Vekllei   1.2. Principles #  The economy informs the high standard of living, but also influences architecture, culture and even the Vekllei person himself. In the context of the Vekllei participist economy, even the notions of manhood and womanhood are reorganised around the basic principles of the economy, which are themselves symptoms of Vekllei‚Äôs history, landscape and culture.\nThe core principles of Vekllei‚Äôs parecon, usually identified by name as petticoat society, are as follows:\n Self-management and self-interest through Sundress Municipalism. Classification of property as an independent social organ, like nature. Abolishment of currency and currency-substitutes. Participatory employment. Economic feminisation.  1.3. Culture #  Most unusual is Vekllei‚Äôs cultural phantom of property and its absence in business and the home. That is not to indicate a tendency of either private or shared commodity, but rather an absence of commodity altogether ‚Äî a fiscal kingdom divorced entirely from neighbouring notions of property, usurped instead by a common understanding of cityscape and objects alike as products of nature, capable neither of possessing or communalising it, codified mostly by a cultural intuition that forms one part of the Vekllei idea of ‚Äòownership‚Äô.\nYes, these people do not recognise property in their domestic lives, nor do they carry with them any currency or currency-substitute (labour vouchers, crediting systems, etc.) ‚Äî but to describe the economic function of society as simply utopian in the fashion of 19th century fiction-writers would be misleading. Vekllei is a miracle produced in the intersection of culture and power that have determined national priority since the First Atomic War. Vekllei is not a blueprint or mathematical template, and appears to be so far irreproducible abroad. This could be because of any or all of the following:\n  Vekllei is perhaps the most highly concentrated country of its size on Earth ‚Äî 80 percent of the 20 millions that call it home are located in the wide urban region referred to as the Capital and the city-state of Vekllei. Indeed, domestically the entire inhabited coastline is considered to be part of one large, singular city community. Vekllei was devastated entirely by the First Atomic War, which extinguished the protectionist Denoisesn regime and left the urban centres bare of infrastructure, allowing architects and urban planners to implement a so-called ‚Äògarden city‚Äô design in the principle of traditional Vekllei spiritualism. Vekllei does not suffer from internal factionalism of the other great powers, and is ethnically and culturally homogenous. The modern Vekllei economy bypassed liberalisation of trade entirely through its monarchical-authoritarian-utopian progression, and has no nostalgia for either currency or real market economics. Most crucially, the last fifty years of advanced robotics has essentially relegated vast swaths of the labour of the majority of her workforce as unnecessary, or comfortable. Automation is not universal, and so all people must work in fairness, but society has reorganised around professional hierarchies where every person casts their lot in at the lowest rung ‚Äî essentially, in theory, alleviating work as anything other than hobby.  So Vekllei has an unusual system that is desperate to consume work-hours. It is labour-intensive where wanted, alleviated by industrial machinery where preferred, and completely automated where necessary.   2. Petticoat Socialism #  3.

Under Construction\nThis page is still under construction, and may be incomplete.  Starred Article\nThis article is complete. It was last updated in July 2020.  üçÅ Tzipora Desmoisnes #  1. Overview #  1.1 Introduction #  Tzipora Desmoisnes (also Zelda lo Ula de Helette Desmoisnes, born May 5 2047) is a Vekllei Gregori Baby and librarian, and is the character utopia of the Petticoat Project. Born to artist and political activist Mette Sumoisnesn and an unknown father, the family moved to Colombia when Tzipora was six months old. Her return to Vekllei as a teen-ager would mark her integration into Vekllei society and her diagnosis as Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s first victim of Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome.\nTzipora is characterised by her intense disposition and conservative tastes, informed in part by her youth growing up poor in Colombia and the United States. Although she is naturally quiet and independent, she loves dearly her adoptive father Baron Desmoisnes and family friend Ayn Rumouisen, and holds affectionate, close relationships with those important to her.\n   Tzipora struggles with undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder, which interferes with her sleep and manifests as several triggers, including large dogs and lying on her chest. Her nervous behaviour has manifested in various tics, she is most obviously nervous pulling and rubbing of her clothes and nose. She is relatively unknown at a national level in Vekllei, except as an occasional medical curiosity, but is relatively famous internationally as the oldest surviving Gregori Baby.\nAfter the American invasion of Colombia in 2057, Mette paid an education broker several thousands of pesos to arrange Tzipora‚Äôs education in California. Although Tzipora would graduate in 2061, she had lost contact with her mother and had lapsed on her education visa. Without an allowance and barred from legitimate work, she moved to Utah the same year in search of income.\nAfter finding work as a motel maid and residence at a women‚Äôs shelter, Tzipora was witness to much of the industrial unrest in Utah in the early 2060s. After being threatened and later nearly murdered by strikebreakers for her association with the United Mine Workers, at that time an illegal organisation, she met [[Baron Desmoisnes]], an agent of the Vekllei Americas Bureau at National Intelligence. In 2063, she would flee Utah under his advice and return to Vekllei under emergency asylum.\nSince arriving in [[Vekllei]] at the age of 16, Tzipora has received two doctorates from Montre University and currently works as a community librarian in the small Montre village of Montre-Lola.\n2. Early Life #  Birth in Ro #  Mette Sumoisnesn #  Mette became pregnant aged 22 during her revival as an underground sculpture artist. Unsure of whether she was ready to raise a child, she later returned home to her family home for the first time in six years on the advice of her friends. The following Autumn, Tzipora was born.\nShe was delivered at the Ro Maternity Clinic without a father, since Mette was involved with several partners at the time.\nChildhood in Colombia #  3. Education in the United States #  2057 (First Year) #  Shaky beginnings #  In 2057, Tzipora began her first year at St Mary\u0026rsquo;s Catholic College in Sacramento at age 10.\n2058 (Second Year) #  2059 (Third Year) #  2060 (Fourth Year) #  An illicit relationship #  By early summer in 2060, Tzipora came to rely emotionally on John Suzak, her mathematics teacher. The intensification of her feelings for him culminated in July, when Suzak discussed taking her to Disneyland. Although nothing would come of these plans, they would come back to haunt Tzipora.\nSchool Pariah #  By August 2060, Suzak had been quietly reassigned by the school board and disappeared from classes soon after. His predation on students had been an open secret, and rumour of his lovers soon focused on one of his students, a sixteen-year-old named Sue Jacobson. Suspicion was raised further by Jacobson\u0026rsquo;s absence from classes in the month following Suzak\u0026rsquo;s departure, leading to speculation by her peers that she had run off with him. By the time Jacobson returned to school in September, she found herself the subject of intense ridicule and gossip.\nAlthough Jacobson was never sure of who Suzak\u0026rsquo;s other girlfriends were, her friend Dolly told her that Tzipora, with whom she shared a dorm, had visited Disneyland with him in August. Hoping to distract attention from herself, Jacobson told peers that Tzipora had fallen pregnant while vacationing with him at Disneyland, which was why she\u0026rsquo;d been in the hospital. Although it was a preposterous fabrication, and Tzipora had never been to Disneyland or so much as kissed a boy, she was already regarded as a loser among her classmates and the rumour quickly stuck.\nEven though most quietly considered Jacobson to have been Suzak\u0026rsquo;s illicit lover, Tzipora was an easy target and much of the ridicule was directed towards her. Although public bullying quickly settled in the weeks following, most of her classmates would never quite see Tzipora the same way. Worst of all, the rumour had spread throughout her year and the school, and had poisoned most people\u0026rsquo;s impressions of Tzipora before they\u0026rsquo;d met her. Tzipora, for her part, struggled to defend herself \u0026ndash; she\u0026rsquo;d never been to Disneyland, and had never been pregnant, but it was true that she\u0026rsquo;d had a crush on Suzak. The grain of truth was enough to falter her confidence in defence.\nTzipora failed most of her exams in October, in part because of the stress the incident with Suzak had caused her. After her mother failed to return her letters sent in early December, Tzipora was rapidly becoming convinced that she was now alone in the world.\nA Physical Toll #  Around the time the bullying started, Tzipora fell ill from the stress. Although she would later remark that her visible tics were brought about by her time in Utah, the truth was that she first exhibited physical tics sometime during her experience in September-thru-November. Even when mildly anxious she would cover her speech with pulling and tugging on her shirt, and would wipe her nose with her fingers and hand incessantly.\n2061 (Final Year) #  A Lonely New Year #  Sue Jacobson\u0026rsquo;s Arrest #  In March, Dolly, who had told the falsehood about Tzipora and Suzak going to Disneyland, had a falling out with Sue Jacobson. Shortly after, when confronted about lying about Jacobson in class, Dolly let slip that it was Jacobson who was the liar, as Jacobson had lied about Tzipora\u0026rsquo;s pregnancy in the first place. This information made its way back to Tzipora, whose bewilderment at the mundanity of Jacobson\u0026rsquo;s reasoning quickly transformed into rage.\nAlthough powerless to act out her revenge fantasies, Tzipora kept a close eye on everything Jacobson did from then on. Then, in May, shortly after Tzipora\u0026rsquo;s 14th birthday, an opportunity presented itself.\nOne week to the day after Tzipora\u0026rsquo;s birthday, Jacobson left her schoolbag behind in the classroom while the class changed for gym class. Tzipora, who had received permission from the nurse to sit out activities, quickly seized on her absence and began rummaging through her belongings, looking for something to steal or destroy. She came across Jacobson\u0026rsquo;s diary, which, among other things, mentioned Jacobson\u0026rsquo;s involvement with a book club run by her cousin. Taking note of the names in her contacts and looking to cause trouble, Tzipora placed an anonymous tip with the police that a girl in her class was organising communist support among the students.\nUnknown to Tzipora was that the book club in question occasionally circulated banned literature, and an investigation the day after the call revealed anarchist works hidden in Sue\u0026rsquo;s dorm. Sue Jacobson, her cousin, three other girls from St Mary\u0026rsquo;s and six other people in total were arrested in the weeks following. Most, Sue among them, were sentenced to 8 years in prison after an investigation by the House Committee for Unamerican Activities. Six months later, in November, John Suzak would also be arrested in connection to the circulation of terrorist works.\nTzipora, terrified by her actions and that she might be implicated, found herself concerned for her safety. Unable to contact her mother and with her school debt due in June, Tzipora began to make plans to pool the last of her money and travel back to Colombia, hopefully finding her mother there.\n4.

It consists of the Vekllei city-state (referred to as the Home Island or Crown Metropole), two autonomous territories, six crown territories and various possessions including over a hundred satellite islands and islets. It is the 14th most densely-populated country in the world, with a population of 24.4 millions mostly situated around the Capital Region in the south-west of the Home Island. Its capital and largest city is Vekllei in the Capital Region, which is home to two-thirds of the total population. The interior plateau of the Home Island consists of sand and lava fields, flower-tundras, glaciers, and temperate rainforests, and its lowlands are home to many glacial rivers.\nThe Home Island has been inhabited for at least four thousand years by Arctic peoples migrating from Kalalist (Greenland).

Yes, it‚Äôs painfully self-concerned and a little painful to read back, but for newcomers to the project you might find some ‚Äúobvious truths‚Äù about Vekllei you have not yet encountered.  üóº A Cashless Tokyo #  Hobart Phillips #   I did not come to Tokyo to find a reference for the Petticoat Project, because utopia does not exist there for me. In fact, by nearly every Vekllei metric, Tokyo is positively dystopian ‚Äî a consumer paradise of the crushing, isolating modernity Vekllei is supposed to escape. And yet, marks of this city (and this country) are prevalent through Vekllei as a constructed country and my aesthetic as a writer and an artist. I can‚Äôt bring myself to love all of Japanese society, but I do love the country and its people. This intersection between traditional utopian world-building (along the lines of News from Nowhere or even the original Utopia) and the emotional, linear fragments of utopian storytelling which realise the cold encyclopaedia of a utopian world were the focus of my expedition to Japan. The premise of Vekllei society is at odds with so much of Japanese society ‚Äî yet the emotional, aesthetic culture of the country (what I call the ‚Äòcharacter‚Äô of utopianism) has influenced my media creation tremendously.\nAs a supplementary preface, I would like to note that it would be terrible of me to dismiss Japan as an oriental wonder of salarymen and neo-Zaibatsu. That approach has more in common with Frank Capra‚Äôs wartime propaganda piece Know Your Enemy: Japan than it does with real structural criticism. It is all too easy to dismiss the social and economic conditions of the country today as the natural inclination of a Japanese caricature ‚Äî a homogenous hive-mind of enormously productive and obedient people. This is of course a terrible attack on the proud and long-standing tradition of dissent and progressiveness in the country ‚Äî which is also home to one of the world‚Äôs largest opposition communist parties. It is a country of student mobilisation, protests and intense factionalism between the left and right-wing radicals1. It is important not to conflate the impersonal structures of a society with the orientalist idea of cultural predisposition.\nA love of Studio Ghibli films and a desire for material and emotional escapism is what drives my utopian world-building. Where co-founder Isao Takahata had a penchant for artful emotional realism and domestic drama, Hayao Miyazaki has found tremendous success in Japan and abroad with his fantastical stories rich with nostalgia and warmth. They have obvious recurring themes ‚Äî childhood, environmentalism, aircraft, etc., but it is no real secret (at least to media critics and Ghibli superfans) that these overt recurrences are symptomatic of more serious and grounded beliefs. In a fantastic analysis of My Neighbour Totoro, Phillip E. Wegner makes use of Kojin Karatani‚Äôs works (another great influence of mine) to illustrate Miyazaki‚Äôs uniquely Japanese pre-Meiji cross-generational nostalgia evident in the film.\n What Miyazaki presents us with in My Neighbor Totoro is a vision in which the classic \u0026ldquo;what if\u0026rdquo; question of the genre has been proposed: that is, what if the Meiji revolution did not happen? Moreover, since it is the dramatic and rapid modernization of the Meiji period that gives rise to the virulent imperialist nationalism and militarism that ultimately results in the Second World War, Miyazaki also offers in his film us a glimpse of a Japan in which the catastrophe of World War II did not occur2.\n Japan‚Äôs spectre of modernity is a recurring character in many of Miyazaki‚Äôs films, just as the villain of war revives itself time and time again ‚Äî from the steel production of Iron Town in Princess Mononoke to the death of the golden age of aviation in The Wind Rises. Karatani‚Äôs landmark work, Origins of Japanese Literature, makes clear that basic premises of modern society ‚Äî from children to history to nature ‚Äî are not immutable items atomised by scientific fact, but instead products of modern society that have not always existed3 pp.12-44, 113-135. Vekllei reflects this concept, at least superficially ‚Äî children are represented as independent agents desegregated from modern age-based schooling, nature is regarded as a fellow social organ, and work is largely self-satisfying and decommodified. These are things that are important to me and it makes sense enough that Vekllei reflects that.\nSimilarly, even supposedly less political Ghibli films like Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service carry powerful images of the ‚Äòspectre of modernity‚Äô. Regarding the climax of the film in which a zeppelin soars hopelessly out of control over a city, A.J. Rocca hauntingly writes:\n [We] find that this is not truly a witch‚Äôs story, but a ghost story. The ghost died in a fire on 6 May 1937, foreshadowing the fires of a war that would change the world forever. The ghost is called the Spirit of Freedom in the film, but its true name is LZ 129 Hindenburg, and it‚Äôs not the spirit of freedom but the ghost of modernity.4\n So the material manifestation of Japanese society for me‚Äî despite all the glory of her bright packaging and dense infrastructure ‚Äî is an aesthetic and satirical media culture that saturates the Petticoat Project. Vekllei is a \u0026lsquo;poor man‚Äôs Utopia\u0026rsquo;, inspired in part by my superficial understanding of a ‚Äòpoor man‚Äôs Japan\u0026rsquo;. Vekllei, like media representations of postwar Sh≈çwa Japan, has a shadow of pacifism and shame about it (that idea that \u0026lsquo;all politics is sexual pathology‚Äô occurs to me). These are deliberate aesthetic choices that reflect not landscape utopianism but character utopianism ‚Äî the real colour of a constructed world that acts out the structure of mean ideology and culture-constructs. These ill-defined images of utopian society, and a rejection of landscape world-building, are excellent vehicles for utopian writing. After all, it is sustained engagement with utopia that betrays the totality of it5. What fascinates me particularly about Miyazaki‚Äôs unique utopian instincts is his recurring premise is essentially nostalgic and escapist ‚Äî the aesthetic of a Miyazaki film is almost always midcentury or earlier, illustrating a time before Japan‚Äôs ‚Äòmodern century‚Äô. This is in stark contrast to the saccharine optimism of utopian socialists like Morris, Chernyshevsky, and Bellemy, telling stories of a future yet to come.\nAnd that is to say nothing of the aesthetic qualities of a Japanese city! Tokyo is a wonderful glimpse of a retro-future as imagined by the 1980s ‚Äî as though the economic crisis of the 1990s has since suspended time. Japan is clean and modern, but also retrofuturistic. The lifeblood of the city is in rebar and concrete as infrastructure. The people on the street are dressed in conservative items that go without the prudish connotations of similar Western fashion. Working men and women are suited traditionally, many with waistcoats. Such is the visual language of modern Japan. Young men sport tech-wear or innovative types of street-wear dominated by colour and comfort. General women‚Äôs fashion leans heavily on items popularly discarded in Western markets, at least until recently. Pleat or patterned skirts, blouses, cardigans, hosiery and socks, loafers and brogues, etc. are very common and provide a wonderful anecdotal rebuff to the outrageous images of ‚ÄòHarajuku girls‚Äô and Lolita style that epitomise some ideas of Japanese fashion. The famous ‚Äòsailor uniform‚Äô has been largely phased out of junior and senior high schooling, replaced with Western-style blazers and ties. Tokyo is not ‚Äòbehind‚Äô the rest of the world; that is not what it means to be retrofuturistic. In my eyes, it has disembarked from Western technological and fashion attitudes some time ago and has since progressed on its own collective cultural intuition, and has subsequently spent the last few decades exporting media, fashion and culture into the West. It‚Äôs a great thing to see in person, at the heart of it all.\nDespite my qualms with modern Japanese consumer society, Vekllei is perched on a romanticised and fictitious Japanese aesthetic, and the country is enormously influential on the way I go about world-construction. With one sentence I will denounce the complexity of Japanese honorific language systems and in the other fawn over the mixed agricultural-residential suburbs that make up so much of the land outside of Tokyo‚Äôs city limits. Koka parks were inspired by these displays of community food production. The Vekllei Constabulary were created after research and experience with the Japanese Police Box system. Vekllei‚Äôs knotted network of trains and streetcars are reminiscent of Tokyo and Hiroshima. For all my public rejection of modern consumer society, and my begrudging participation in it, the Japanese qualities of Vekllei are valuable and are utopian in their own right ‚Äî and so Tokyo remains one of the most important inspirations of Petticoat Society in the world.\nSo what of that dichotomy? Of deep ideological incongruities with Japanese consumer society, but an embarrassing affection for the mythological post-war aesthetic and Japanese culture? The truth of it is that Vekllei is first and foremost a collection of stories, and stories are the domain of the emotional. Wonderful, vague images of utopia ‚Äî like washing corn in My Neighbour Totoro or an all-night writing session in Whisper of the Heart. My time in Tokyo introduced me to a wealth of these nostalgic feelings ‚Äî of curiosity in a cauldron of social atomisation. Life in Tokyo is not without problems, and it is certainly not my perfect idea of utopia, but the intersection of the culture and promise of Japanese society, either in the past as alt-history or in the future as science fiction, has me coming back time and time again to better realise my own projects of utopia.

Broadly, Newda buildings emphasise distinction from the surrounding landscape (called Dumousiantopet, or ‚Äòbeautiful and seperate‚Äô), natural decay, and honesty in material and construction. Vekllei‚Äôs great Parliament House is Newda; as are the little rural homes found in the mountains inland in Vekllei.\nTzipora‚Äôs house in the village of Montre-Lola ( as depicted on the map here) is built in what Vekllei calls ‚ÄúAzores revivalism‚Äù, a Newda style heavily influenced by the stripped deco and streamline moderne buildings of a century prior. It is part of a constant conversation Newda holds with its past, as both a deeply modernist, progressive school and one bound up in the wider aesthetic and cultural traditions of Upen, the spiritualism of Vekllei.\nHer house is small, but appears larger due to the layout of the structure. A small sleeping loft sits atop the living, bathing and cooking areas of the home, and opens out into a private rooftop garden. The utilities tower also hides a small staircase leading to the roof, which is also accessible for outdoor recreation. Her home stands amidst the farmland of Montre-Lola, and very near the library and primary school where she works. Her property is marked at its end by a creek that runs into the Dentre River. She has a vegetable garden in her backyard, and shares her paddocks with her neighbours for grazing periodically throughout the year.\nHer house was erected in gratitude by her neighbours out of prefab components, and assisted by a ‚Äúconstruction line,‚Äù ‚Äî a temporary rail line in which goods are delivered and cranes are supported, minimising the need for lorries. Houses of this type and period are rarely seen in agricultural settings in other countries, but in Vekllei, where Landscape has been abolished, there might as well be no difference between a building suitable for the cosmopolitan, coastal cities and a dwelling for a farmer-girl.\n"});index.add({'id':21,'href':'/posts/2020-08-12-ageless/','title':"The Thousand-Year-Old Girl",'section':"Archive",'content':" The concept of living forever jumps out at people uncomfortable with their own existence. There is a contemplative instinct among educated people that ‚Äî if they could simply will themselves into a state of self-actualisation ‚Äî death would only be an obstacle to greatness.\nAs Tzipora found out quickly, the opposite was true ‚Äî death and temporality were wells of meaning against which all great people, beauty, and human constructions were cast.\nTzipora Desmoisnes is what is known as a Gregori Baby, a catch-all term for a unique genetic condition that has seemingly produced a variety of miracle children appropriate for the frothing futurism of the atomic age ‚Äî boys and girls who, suspended in the purity and good-naturedness of childhood ‚Äî live forever.\nThere is no single ‚ÄúGregori Baby‚Äù ‚Äî each is unique, and Tzipora is the 13th to have been recognised overall. The phrase is a shortening of Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome, a stand-in for medical information that isn‚Äôt there. The first, Gregori Hordiyenko, was born in 2024. He was healthy, and died of unrelated causes in his 20s. Tzipora, at 13th, continues to live to this day and is the oldest person on Earth.\nThere is a disturbing trend among the Gregori children, first heralded as miracles and symptoms of the space age, to deteriorate medically as more are born. The culprit is the malfunctioning of telomeres in their DNA ‚Äî the source of their longevity ‚Äî which regularly produce devastating chromosomal disorders, including Trisomy 13 \u0026amp; 18, killing most ‚Äúageless children‚Äù before their third birthday. Those that survive are often victims of a severe anaphylaxis caused by a hyperactive immune system ‚Äî rendering many of them permanently sickly. Others find themselves unageing, but continue to grow ‚Äî reaching as tall as 2.5m before their bodies give out from exhaustion and osteoporosis.\nSo what is Gregori syndrome? What does your average (healthy) Gregori baby look like? Their genetic miracle is linked to the structures of the body that activate at puberty, and so girls vary between 11-16 years of age at onset depending on many factors that affect their development. Boys tend to be a little younger, from 8-14. Between the two, girls tend to be more stable, and all but two of the supercentenarian Gregori children are female.\nAmong girls, they are prepubescent and generally stop ageing on the eve of menarche, or their first period. In Tzipora‚Äôs case, her body is estimated to be 13 years and 11 months old. Unlike many Gregori children, Tzipora lives in a wealthy country and has volunteered for extensive research into her genetic makeup, meaning that much of early medical documentation around Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome was received directly from her case.\nMost obvious is that, at a foundational level, her cells are similar in function to unipotent stem cells, and have been since hormones at the end of thelarche suspended her ageing. This change has occurred somewhere in her DNA ‚Äî exactly where is unknown ‚Äî but the end result is that, unlike regular progenitor cells that make up most adult bodies, the building blocks of her body are capable of cell-renewal. Her telomeres, the endcaps of chromosomal DNA in mammals, are undamaged. And so there is an amazing shift in her basic human structure ‚Äî in which human cell lineage, which usually ends in a mature cell incapable of division, is caught and rearranged. With this considered, it is no wonder that Gregori children suffer from such catastrophic chromosomal instability, and why healthy ageless babies are a rarity. Her body is not exactly a ‚Äúbody of stem cells,‚Äù but for their function in a healthy Gregori child, they might as well be.\nSo it is that nothing about Tzipora is changing. She suffers from pains in her legs often ‚Äî called growing pains, although they are not from growing ‚Äî and her cells continue to replenish, albeit at a rate 1.25 times that of normal people. She is, in essence, ‚Äúgrowing‚Äù as any other premenarchal girl would, but she is not getting bigger or becoming older.\nTzipora is blessed with an adult life in Vekllei, where the ‚ÄúChild‚Äù does not exist as it does in the West, and her individual freedoms are far-ranging. She may smoke, and drink, and has held many different jobs in her life. She holds two doctorates in English and Vekllei Literature. She is obviously sterile ‚Äî even if she were to somehow ‚Äúage out‚Äù of prepubescence into pubescence and receive the required hormones, she simply lacks the genetic code to reproduce ‚Äî but raises many children through her active participation in village life and her roles as Montre-Lola‚Äôs municipal and school librarian.\nIn other countries, with coded roles for children, their problems are much greater. Unable to form adult relationships and often incapable of finding work, many work in entertainment or fall into poverty as they outlive their friends and parents. Socially ostracised and forever young, many are victims of superstition and fear. As the pattern of Gregori children indicates an increase in mortality, even as more are born, their appearance is both a miracle and a tragedy ‚Äî ageing not through mitosis but through weathering the societies in which they live.\n"});index.add({'id':22,'href':'/posts/2020-08-09-spaceship/','title':"The 31st Century ‚Äî Vekllei throughout our Solar System",'section':"Archive",'content':" The Epoch of Rest #  We‚Äôve spent a lot of time in the 21st century ‚Äî but Tzipora is biologically immortal. Where does she go from here? Well, let‚Äôs enjoy a small glimpse at that future together, by winding the clock forward one thousand years.\nBy 3076, our Solar System is a pleasant place to be. Most of the planets we once gazed at from afar are now habitable and lived on. The Great Epoch of Rest has begun.\nThere is no great interstellar empire, no rise and fall of spacefaring supernations ‚Äî a Vekllei way of life is now lived out in multicultural, prosperous clusters of people across our Solar System. The ordinary person is afforded incredible freedoms previously reserved for science fiction through the accessibility of personal light spacecraft, translated literally as ‚Äúboats‚Äù.\nThis here is the M-7000 APRICOT, manufactured by the Government Aerospace Factories (GAF) of Vekllei. Many companies are contracted by the GAF, including General Reactor S.A., to whom this boat lends most of its flight control systems and all of its power plant. It is a light, personal boat for women built in 2807, making it relatively unique in both its 28th century design language and its gendered marketing. While the personal boat market was growing rapidly by this time, the vast majority of owners and pilots were men. The APRICOT set out to change that, and Tzipora, the world‚Äôs oldest living person with a youthful face, was among the first to demonstrate the accessibility and freedoms of space travel for women and girls in the personal boat market. It was her first boat, and despite its orientation for women it was christened with a male name: BARON.\nIt is a comfortable and pleasant craft that can be lived in for extended periods of time. Tzipora has done just that, travelling to stars in search of water-planets with Micronesian archipelagos, where she likes to spend most of her time. Its glass roof across the entire accessible cabin, including bubbled cockpit, gives it breathtaking visibility in the depths of space and the most scenic of planets alike. Like almost all spacecraft, it is unarmed, save for the pacifying ‚Äújazz‚Äù electric canon, named for its firing sound reminiscent of a double bass strum.\nWhen she tires of being alone, she returns to her hometown of Montre-Lola in Vekllei frequently. Boats are usually parked at off-world stations, preserving the aerospace and quiet of the Solar System.\nLight speed is exceeded through superluminal travel. So-called black boxes require extraordinarily precise programming, since superluminal travel is in all ways but name time travel, and the universe does not tolerate time travel. Coordinates calculated in the universal pyramid system by a pyramid computer ensure that a vessel arrives when it arrives, so to speak. The alternative is going nowhere at all ‚Äî there is no in-between.\nSuperluminal systems are affected by gravity, so any person looking to exceed the speed of light and subsequently visit other stars must take the highways beyond our home system‚Äôs planetary orbit and launch into so-called free-travel from there. There are only a handful of these highways ‚Äî the solar system is very, very large, and human construction is very, very small.\nThere was an instinct among many people that human progress would naturally scale exponentially ‚Äî these were extrapolated from the remarkable progress in the lifetime of Tzipora‚Äôs parents and grandparents, who saw canvas aircraft in their childhood advance to the landing of a man on the moon, and again in her own exaggerated lifetime, in which the provinciality of her youth has simultaneously seen an expansion and exploitation of the planets in our native solar system.\nThis curve of progress was not to be, however ‚Äî and it also explains why we had such trouble meeting aliens in the first place. Part of it was simply that there are very few worlds with water that also formed earthlike landmasses nearby ‚Äî there are many aliens, and Tzipora has seen many herself, but most of them are fish and fish-adjacent. The second is that, if there is civilised life out there, it has most probably encountered the same engineering truths that humanity did, in our great interstellar project of the last thousand years. Namely that, all accounted for, there is no use for wasteful megastructures when a small one will do. People are having less children ‚Äî on Mars, Mercury and Neptune, the population is actually shrinking. What good is the so-called ‚Äúocean liner of the stars,‚Äù with a capacity of millions? There are around 12 billion people across the solar system today. Maybe another 8 billion in the Ala system. Maybe a few millions more who have simply given up society for scattered stars in our neighbourhood.\nIt is likely that if any other civilised races exist, they are simply of our scale, or have destroyed themselves completely in the reckless pursuit of expansion. Humanity is lucky not to count themselves among them.\nThe APRICOT is one of many models produced by Vekllei‚Äôs Government Aerospace Factories. It is now possible for the ordinary person to explore distant stars for themselves, granting freedoms unimaginable in a previous age. Such is life in the Great Epoch of Rest.\n"});index.add({'id':23,'href':'/posts/2020-08-01-tzipora-concept/','title':"Meet Tzipora ‚Äî concept panel for a Vekllei comic",'section':"Archive",'content':" Unique among girls #  There are a lot of things Tzipora does differently to everybody else, and they start to make a lot more sense when you realise Tzipora either does not realise she is unusual, or does not care.\nShe has a lot of endearing characteristics that give great character to her mannerisms and physicality. She has a small overbite that makes her look a little froggy, and ritually pulls on her shirt and wipes her nose in anxious conversation. She is round-headed and cuts her hair herself. She talks in a low, expressive voice. She has been poorly socialised in childhood, and is afraid of casual conversation with people she does not know. She is keenly socially attuned and feels awkwardness painfully.\nShe wears the same clothes two or three days in a row.

She doesn‚Äôt like fashionable or voguish people, whom she regards as decadent and offensive. To Tzipora, taste is timeless and bound to the soul. In her case, this fact has held true ‚Äî she has dressed the same as childhood, and very little else has changed about her in that time.\nShe is paranoid and conservative, good-natured and austere, with a moral outlook bound by her deepest anxieties and obsessions. She is deeply spiritual and material, fascinated with objects and their history. She has many collections of many things she‚Äôs found.

No food was ever left on her plate. There was a deep anxiety that whatever wasn‚Äôt claimed would be lost.\nShe was also naturally obsessive and material-oriented, keenly aware of the importance of objects measured by metrics in her own silly head. You can discover a lot about a person from their trinkets and toys ‚Äî let‚Äôs discover a bit about Tzipora.\n Her handbag is manufactured by Spaa S.p.A., a design firm in the capital. They‚Äôre a luxury item in the international market but readily available in Vekllei, since few other handbag makers operate on the scale of Spaa. Ayn picked it out shortly after Tzipora‚Äôs arrival for its colour, after Tzipora told her she did not own any red things. Tzipora has a sweet tooth. Especially for soda, which she calls ‚Äúfizzy drink‚Äù. On her person at any time, she carries a flavoured beverage from one of several brands capable of meeting her discerning tastes. She supplements them with a water bottle, since not even fizzy drink refreshes as well as water after phys-ed or a hot day. She also stocks her arsenal of snacks with good fruit picked off trees that overhang footpaths, as well as devastating salvos of Vekllei‚Äôs finest confectionary, including Fruit Tingles and chocolate pearls. Other girls in her class bemoan her childish metabolism as she drinks soda for lunch while they watch the scales. The nostalgic whimsy of the sweets is tempered by two or three loose cigarettes that float around in her purse at any given time. She‚Äôs not a regular smoker, but she‚Äôs prone to attacks related to stress, and nothing helps as much as a drag. She carries matches, for not much reason other than that‚Äôs what Baron uses, and Tzipora is notoriously sentimental. Tzipora has a rock collection that sits on her bedroom sill, and her recent additions sit at the bottom of her purse. She‚Äôs not a rock elitist; quartz from footpaths catches her attention as easily as igneous treasures like palagonite. Her favourite is obsidian. She carries a small collection of useful books, including a contemporary paperback and a notebook. The paperback is for recess and lunch; the notebook is for language notes and phone numbers. Her Vekllei I.D. papers, which are both a passport and a reference booklet of key information and services, are carried on her at all times. It‚Äôs not really necessary in day-to-day life ‚Äî but who knows when it might be, and Tzipora won‚Äôt be the one patting her pockets at the airport gate. Finally, there are a few accessories sitting in the bag. Tzipora made a ring for Cobian in metalworking class, but Cobian is on a school trip to France at the moment and Tzipora is waiting for her return. She has a wristwatch given to her by Baron, which she wears sometimes depending on the occasion. Other items are more precautionary ‚Äî a scarf for the wind, a handkerchief for sneezing, and a spare pair of socks for when she visits Cobian‚Äôs house or if she needs to double up in cold weather. As summer turns to autumn, she also carries gloves and a beanie.  With everything in its place, her handbag is her anchor in the world outside her small second-floor apartment. The decommodification of society has only intensified the social value of objects, and they remain as important as ever in the life of the ordinary Vekllei person.\n"});index.add({'id':27,'href':'/posts/2020-07-13-economy/','title':"The Race for Inefficiency ‚Äî Vekllei‚Äôs advocation of austerity, apathy, and playfulness as economic principles",'section':"Archive",'content':" This post is about the economy of Vekllei. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a long one. If you have any questions, just ask.\nOverview of the Bureau System #  There are many thousands of companies busy with work in Vekllei. The vast majority of these companies are single-person shops (S.p.A., or senrouiva pettetie anaproiouya). Also common are wobbly shops, or co-operative businesses (S.q.A., or senrouiva qualitie anaproiouya). The largest of the non-bureau companies are village factories (S.p.M., or senrouiva persimonaya manufacturie).\nThe bureau-level world is full of company mastheads that emphasise modernity, dynamism and progress. Vekllei‚Äôs ‚Äúprivate businesses‚Äù, however, tend to be local in taste. The vast majority of S.p.A. and S.q.A. businesses bear the family names of their founders ‚Äî Desmesyo S.p.A., Risyiouisnesn Home Machines S.q.A., etc. Their legal denominations are almost always affixed to the end of their nameplates.\nTheir senrouiva designation marks them as non-bureau businesses. A bureau, as a reminder, is simply the top-level organisation of a trade union that organises business in the country. In practice, it means that a company is responsible to the political organs of the country. Although independent from the government, bureau business is inextricably entwined in government concern and runs parallel to it.\nSenrouvia businesses are also part of the bureau structure, but are in practice not managed directly by them. They are usually united in local concern by so-called petty bureaus; small cooperative organs that safeguard local interest and business. These petty bureaus are often at odds with the bureau organs proper, and so even though they are part of the same structure, they are fundamentally political opposed.\nSo what is sort of business goes on in a bureau proper?\nThere are two common categories of so-called ‚Äúbureau firms‚Äù. You have state industries (S.A., or societie indastrie), which deal with manufacturing and exploitation of resources that require direct management by a public organ. You‚Äôll already be familiar with several ‚Äî General Reactor S.A., Comen Aeroyards S.A., Farmer‚Äôs Syndicate S.A. to name a few.\nYou also have state requisites (A.r., or requoisesiasn amourisocietie), which refer to the vast government-operated organs made up six categories primarily.\n Utilities (A.r.Un.) Transport (A.r.R.) Education (A.r.E.) Local healthcare (A.r.F.) Construction (A.r.Lo.) Automation (A.r.M.)  Yes ‚Äî education is not organised as a government department, but a bureau business. Other state responsibilities are folded directly into government departments ‚Äî war, intelligence, healthcare, police, fire, and the mint are all managed directly by the government.\nArgument #  With the legal division of enterprise laid out, let us examine again the four precepts of the Vekllei economic ideology.\n Self-management and self-interest through Sundress Municipalism. Classification of property as an independent social organ, like nature. Abolishment of currency and currency-substitutes. Participatory employment. Economic feminisation.  These four principles reveal a great deal about the character of the country, and stand largely at face value. There is an interest in chasing the promises of modernity while deconstructing its metaphysical constructions, through the abolishment of exchange-value, property and the overhaul of gender-economics. There are anarchist gestures in each principle, yet it is obvious that the product of these values complexify the conventional anarchist imagination. This is part of a series of contradictions ‚Äî between free and planned markets, between internationalism and provinciality, between man and woman, between freedom and security.\nAusterity #  The bureau system is plagued by inefficiencies, arising from logistic systems premised on warehousing, poor Coasean bargaining between petty bureaus and proper bureaus, a political emphasis on macroeconomic outcomes, a decoupling of aggregate demand and national economic output, cultural intolerance for Pareto inefficiencies, etc.\nLuxury goods often vary in both supply and access, and economies are often severely localised to the point of provincialism, meaning that Vekllei has failed to transition reliably to a modern consumer society. The inhabitants of the Montre borough most often eat seafood because speciality meats, especially authentic red meat, are scarce. The opposite is true in Yana. Clothes are repaired and regifted, appliances are available only from regional outlets usually located in the same city as the factory, and culture and diet are fiercely regional.\nThis is, in part, a result of unflinching national austerity and the sublimation of artificial markets prompted by Vekllei‚Äôs gold-based auxiliary currency, which necessitates meeting debt obligations for its strength internationally. There is a belief in Vekllei that the wealth of the country allowed the abolition of the currency ‚Äî in fact, the opposite is true. The abolition of currency allows a permanent wealth that compensates for the inefficiencies of the bureau system. The bureau firms do not pay their workers ‚Äî on paper, there are no expenses for anything beyond raw commodity exchange. This is how Vekllei‚Äôs largest companies ‚Äî and, per the bureau system, its government ‚Äî remain solvent.\nAusterity is a cultural force, too ‚Äî the scarcity of luxury goods inflates their social value, where comforts and necessities are largely abundant in automation. It creates an unimportant hardship that keeps Vekllei people forward-facing, lean, and ambitious. To acquire Picco S.p.A.‚Äôs iconic lounge chairs, you have to travel to their outlet in Horn, hundreds of kilometres from the capital area. There is no motivation for a craftsman to meet demand ‚Äî there is no petty consumption, either. To own a Picco chair means you have understood its cultural value, utility and craftsmanship, and have made the effort to find and transport one to your home. Inconvenience, and by extension, austerity, is celebrated as a ‚Äútrial of ownership.‚Äù Objects are very important in Vekllei, and craftsmanship is highly valued, and so people like to surround themselves with hand-made, sublime things wrought not just by the labour of the artisan, but their own effort to acquire it.\nPetty austerity instills a national sentiment that tells the ordinary Vekllei person they are hardier than the ordinary American or European, even if the wealth of the ordinary Vekllei person is much greater than that of the ordinary American or European.\nApathy #  Despite a vast, loosely organised private market in the senrouiva categorisation, Vekllei does not reward entrepreneurial ambition. Ambitious people are funnelled into positions of power in bureau firms and political office, but the founding of S.p.As and S.q.As is rarely motivated by a desire for influence or power. Indeed, artisanal S.p.As are often incapable of the sort of economies of scale needed for expansion. Vekllei instead relies on a sort of economic apathy, in which aggregate demand and productivity are spurned for immediate interest and pleasure.\nThis ensures that\n luxury products remain creative, personal works per Upen‚Äôs insistence on the symbiosis of labour and product the private senrouiva market is not capable of threatening the provincialism of Sundress Municipalism, which might make a commodity universally accessible and threaten to introduce generic consumer society into Vekllei life the private senrouiva market under petty bureau organisation does not threaten the organised de facto monopolies of the bureau companies  If Vekllei has replaced the commodity with the object, then it is through economic apathy that they have ensured objects will never again become commodities. Just as the ordinary Vekllei person is apolitical, so too are they apathetic towards change in their purchasing habits, favouring small, inconvenient and personal brands over those exploiting aggregate demand. In a sense, this also contributed to the popular Vekllei term product atheism, in which the metaphysics of products are dismantled and rearranged into social forms.\nIn this sense, the apathy is found on both ends ‚Äî within the senrouiva business owner, who is provided little upward mobility to satisfy ambition beyond local and regional expansion, and within the consumer, who recognises products only within cultural and social dimensions. Neither is conducive to a functioning, fair market on an interregional scale.\nPlay #  Play is the foundational motivation of most work in Vekllei. There are existential motivators, too ‚Äî a desire to wield power, or professional legacy ‚Äî but in many professions it is play by which a Vekllei person justifies labour. It is also why work is fiercely protected by petty bureaus and other labour organisations ‚Äî work is their connection to wider society, and that connection is held sacred in Upen.\nIt is through work as play that Vekllei is able to justify the employment of children. Financial motivations for work have all but disappeared ‚Äî in its place, the workplace has to convince people to work. There are few state protections for businesses unable to maintain a workforce, either ‚Äî it is one of the most common reasons for the shuttering of a company. The boss must convince his workers to stay, and so a total inversion of power has occurred.\nIn place of money, there is prestige, and in prestige there is myth. Few people have genuine interest in Fordism. Many more are attracted to the hand-crafted furniture of Picco S.p.A., and becoming recognised as a builder of great things. In a sense, a person ‚Äúacts out‚Äù the role of a craftsman, in the same way a person ‚Äúacts out‚Äù the role of a police officer, or ‚Äúacts out‚Äù life as a pilot.\nIn this system, the childish spirit of recreation, duty and ‚Äúthe adult world‚Äù is acted out by millions of Vekllei people each day. Seeds planted by a child play-acting as a farmer continue to grow, and so too does the Vekllei economy feed its population through the intersection of fantasy and labour. At this point it is obvious that play is not fantasy at all, but in fact a motivation for labour as genuine as profit. Where it falls short, in hard, disempowering jobs, it is automated and conscripted through the mandatory service system. As it is often described:\n‚ÄúThe Bureau System is labour-intensive where wanted, alleviated by industrial machinery where preferred, and automated where necessary.‚Äù\nIn its wake are states of play, and through play comes a decent framework for living, obvious in the basic satisfaction of the Vekllei people.\n"});index.add({'id':28,'href':'/posts/2020-07-08-police/','title':"Police in Vekllei",'section':"Archive",'content':" There are two regular police organs in Vekllei.\n Fedecenoayan porits (national police, or venopor) Comoisniyan denporitsa (local police, or cosmopor)  A young venopor officer stands on the left, in the full street regalia they‚Äôre renowned for. Unlike cosmopor, they often carry machine guns while on patrol and are stationed outside of government buildings, hospitals, train stations, ports, schools and any company managed directly by a bureau, which is a trade organ of national importance. They are special units of special purpose, and supplement the deficiencies of local policing through their training and tactical deployment.\nThey are police insofar as they protect and respond to their community, including through special tactics situations, but are paramilitary in their wider function as a defence force for critical infrastructure. This is reflected in their history, traced cleanly back past independence and the Atomic War to the royal guards and junta federal police of old society, which continue to be reflected in their uniforms and several other ceremonial artefacts, like swords and knee boots. Venopor is a complex organisation with many different purposes. There are street patrols, pictured here, but there are also intelligence units associated with HO/NI and by extension the military, as well as tactical response teams, bomb squads, search and rescue and most other specialised emergency units outside of the capabilities of any given local police station.\nThis is contrast to the cosmopor, a more conventional police outfit. A cosmopor officer stands on the right, in standard summer uniform. He carries a radio, revolver and rubber baton for the worst of his duties, and is embedded deep into his local community. Cosmopor officers traditionally visit and introduce themselves to each house in their beat, and spend far more of their time mediating, counselling and organising than they do making arrests. The autonomy of most Vekllei communities largely spurns petty legal proceedings, and so the cosmopor are a critical aspect of sundress municipalism, resolving disputes personally and taking custody of a person only when it‚Äôs needed. Most crime in Vekllei tends to be emotionally motivated ‚Äî so it is in this domain that cosmopor navigate.\nThis makes the cosmopor especially powerful figures in a Vekllei village or township, but their duties are closely watched. While the Vekllei village may be autonomous, all officers in Vekllei are responsible to a division of venopor called ‚Äúofficer welfare,‚Äù or picosec, which operates autonomously to seek out incompetent or misbehaving police officers, no matter their jurisdiction or status. Where most business in Vekllei has very little in the way of professional behaviour or ‚Äúwork culture‚Äù, policing in Vekllei is held to high standards, and they are severely bound by traditions that have become codified as the country has grown. This is a time and place where the children of police often inherit the jobs of their parents, and the constables of a village often have roots that go back centuries. This often makes cosmopor very respected figures, and their successors and recruits are expected to work for that respect.\nIn a country that has done away with money as a measure of success, professional legacy is profoundly important in Vekllei. In this inversion of priority, teachers, doctors, pilots, constables and librarians are celebrated. This is not founded in a general egalitarianism, but in fact the precise opposite ‚Äî a celebration of success and influence, touching the lives of those around them. The glamour, and paycheque, has largely been stripped away. Only the work remains, and so that work has become more important than ever.\n"});index.add({'id':29,'href':'/posts/2020-06-14-map/','title':"A Map of Vekllei ‚Äî 100 Boroughs; 100 Hearts",'section':"Archive",'content':" Map Key\n Red: Magjet trains, 750km/h\nYellow: Bullet trains, 300-400km/h\nOrange: Regional trains, \u0026lt;150km/h\nBrown: Local trains, including limited express, \u0026lt;100km/h\nBlue: National highway\nDashed: Ferry line\nGreen: tarmacadamed airport\n The largest division of any portion of Vekllei land is the borough; a region of varying size and population with common culture, food dependency and economic interest. Anything larger than that is simply Vekllei ‚Äî they are ‚Äúone city‚Äù, after all, and consider themselves a city-state.\nThere have been exactly 100 boroughs since 2015. Each is named after the largest city in its region.\n The smallest borough is Bakur, in Afouismeh, with a population of 7,500 people. The largest is Vekllei proper, in the Capital Region, of 2.4 millions.  This transit map illustrates all 100 boroughs, Vekllei‚Äôs five tallest mountains, its permafrost glaciers and Tzipora‚Äôs home in Montre-Lola. Her five largest boroughs ‚Äî namely Vekllei, Lonne, Adouisneh, Montre and Copette, are highlighted.\nEven in this simple transit map we can see several truths about the country, like its population bias on the West Coast and the emptiness of the Lava volcanic region. You might recognise a few names there, like Lola in the West (Tzipora‚Äôs home with Baron) and Yana in Vekllei‚Äôs Ro Highlands (Ayn‚Äôs birthplace).\nTrains are clean, reliable, fast, efficient and safe. They are incorporated under Vekllei Rail, owned by the Transport Group Bureau. Using this map, designed for domestic tourists and foreigners, the adequacy of Vekllei‚Äôs rail transport is easy to plan around ‚Äî you can eat breakfast in a cafe in the seaside town of Mumen, and hike before midday on the glacial slopes of Askayoisn. Since there are no tickets or costs, there are no excuses for not visiting relatives in the country, now that transport is now a trivial inconvenience.\nEach borough is represented in Vekllei‚Äôs parliament by an elected representative. These representatives wield extraordinarily disproportionate power ‚Äî the representative for Callaisn, for example, represents hundreds of times more people than the representative for Tanger, but both have the same vote. This is because boroughs are not just representative of their populations, but also their environments, industry and other social organs otherwise unable to vote. It is important to keep in mind that Upen (and consequently, policy) recognises the landscape itself as the sovereign organ of the country, and so in this sense it has its own interests and projections.\nIn practice, representatives act in an advisory, nonpartisan role in government, voting rarely in an auxiliary role to the professionalised, elected legislature. Vekllei has a strictly constitutional parliament, and the economy largely prohibits interference. In this sense, the parliament is both partially undemocratic in its inefficiency and apolitical in its orientation as a sort of civil service bureau, managing state affairs and reacting to pressures and the long-term aims outlined in the 2015 constitution. In the Vekllei mindset, the ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù is more or less another bureau, no different or particularly more interesting than the Transport Group Bureau. The trains, at least, have a tangible impact on their daily lives.\nHow appropriate, then, that this transit map produced in the summer months of 2076 combines both monuments of society. It also offers a glimpse of a larger, documented country not necessarily revealed in piecemeal story posts.\n"});index.add({'id':30,'href':'/posts/2020-06-24-crown/','title':"The Vekllei Crown ‚Äî coins of a moneyless country",'section':"Archive",'content':" Vekllei, legendarily, does not use circulate currency. Goods and services are moved and offered arbitrarily, provided amply in abundance. Anything that is not abundant is manufactured and distributed directly under the control of a bureau, which is a trade organ responsible to the affairs of the country. At no point do coins or paper currency change hands in the day-to-day affairs of the country.\nIn this sense, Vekllei is usually described as ‚Äúmoneyless‚Äù ‚Äî yet it does in fact have a currency. The Vekllei Kroner, or ‚ÄúCrown,‚Äù is hundreds of years old, and Vekllei still operates a mint for currency. At any time, a Vekllei person can write to the National Mint and order a set of coins, like the ones pictured above. So what is going on here?\nAlthough the Kroner has not been used since 2022, after the last village in Stochi returned coinage to the Mint, it continues to exist to this day as a gold-backed currency in the International Market, through which Vekllei trades with other countries. The physical coins, produced mostly as a novelty in the tradition of mayaesdiou (medallions, or small metal pieces commonly collected and given in Vekllei), are a physical coinage of the International Market. The coins also operate as a form of bullion, or wealth reserve, since each coin is worth exactly its face value in gold. Since the International Market is completely closed and independent of the domestic economy, its value is controlled directly by the so-called Government Bank. It is one of the few gold-backed currencies in a developed nation today.\nTo further complicate things, there are actually two different Kroner in Vekllei. There is the Vekllei Kroner, which represents the International Market, but there is also a seperate Government/State Kroner, which is not minted and used only as an investment mechanism, backed by government \u0026ldquo;white bonds\u0026rdquo; which are usually measures of labour-hours or refined materials. It is, in a sense, a fiat currency alongside a gold-backed currency.\nThey exist independently because they are used for two seperate purposes. The Vekllei Kroner is used a wealth reserve and bullion, and also represents the collective wealth of the Vekllei people. Each citizen, in theory, is entitled to an equal share of the Government Bank, although it can only be withdrawn as currency in specific circumstances. Vekllei also holds substantial amounts of foreign currency in the Government Bank and Vekllei Kroner, which is used to invest and stabilise holdings and capital in foreign countries. The Government Kroner, on the other hand, is used as an investment mechanism abroad, usually in support of infrastructure. It is also used to acquire foreign currencies through investment in foreign capital.\nDespite having two currencies, neither the \u0026ldquo;Vekllei Crown\u0026rdquo; or the \u0026ldquo;Government Crown\u0026rdquo; are used in the domestic economy in Vekllei, which is autonomous and not subject to a central bank. So it is that Vekllei‚Äôs currency is both little more than a novelty and essential to the function of the country in a world still ruled by money.\n In the coinage depicted above ‚Äî 8 coins are minted in Vekllei today. They were designed in 2015, in the year of independence. They represent eight core values in the country.\nThe ‚Äúsmall crowns,‚Äù worth 1VK and 10VK respectively, represent fraternity and liberty, two founding elements of the Vekllei constitution. The 50VK coin is plated in silver and has a small ruby inset. Rubies are used to represent energy, in this case, the vitality of the spirits, which dominate Upen and the Vekllei landscape. The 100, 200, 500 and 1,000VK coins represent different landscapes of the country. As a volcanic island nation, the ocean (100) and landscape (200) coins are fairly straightforward. The humanity coin (500) represents the Vekllei people and ancestry ‚Äî note how humans are placed alongside other natural forces. The flower coin (1,000VK) represents the flowers of the country, which are important spiritually and have formed part of the Vekllei identity. Vekllei has the most flowers per capita in the world. The final, larger 10,000VK coin represents the previous seven together, as a total sum of Vekllei landscape and identity.\n To answer Tzipora‚Äôs question ‚Äî a bottle of fizzy drink cost about 2VK in the waning days of coinage in the early 2020s.\n"});index.add({'id':31,'href':'/posts/2020-06-29-montrelola/','title':"Village Map of Montre-Lola",'section':"Archive",'content':" The village of Montre-Lola is home to about 400 people in its entirety, a stone‚Äôs throw from the Aisyo borough. Each morning, however, the population swells as 300 children from tiny villages in both Aisyo and Montre take a fast tram to the Montre-Lola Area School No. 2, a district school raising all ages of local youth.\nLike many Vekllei villages, Montre-Lola‚Äôs history is complex and has origin stories in both viking-inuit settlement as well as less sentimental government programmes that flourished after the atomic war. By historical accounts, Montre-Lola has been inhabited since at least 1500CE. By contemporaneous records, however, it was established as a village in land reform during the 1960s and revitalised by the building of the area school in 2057.\nMontre-Lola features many civic objects common to Vekllei villages ‚Äî a nondenominational place of worship (in this case, a historical Catholic church), a constabulary, a doctor, an auto/tractor pool, a general store, a station platform, and a village hall. A map of the village centre is dominated by the Area School, built in an Edunewda style, which features many new facilities that distinguish it from smaller, 20th-century schools. It‚Äôs a good place to grow up; where farmland and earnest modernity collide.\n Montre-Lola is most relevant as the residence of Tzipora Desmoisnes, the world‚Äôs oldest person and one of the first people to be diagnosed with Gregori-Heitzfeld Syndrome. She works as a librarian in both the Montre-Lola Area School and the Montre-Lola Library \u0026amp; Archives, spending most of her 12-hour workday in either of these institutions. She commutes via fast trams, which arrive automatically at the two platforms in Montre-Lola every half-hour and continue out into the surrounding farms. This means that, if she sets her watch right, she can step outside her front door and arrive at the school library in under ten minutes. This journey is marked in red on the map above.\n Dominated by farmland, Montre-Lola is communal and more traditionally ‚Äòanarchist‚Äô in flavour than Vekllei‚Äôs urban boroughs, which are obscured by convenience. As charming as it is suffocating, the community is very close-knit and made up of all sorts ‚Äî smart educated young men and women sent from Montre to teach, as well as farming families that have resided here for centuries.

As an island nation with a large and multifaceted naval armada, the Oa-Class Battlecruiser is the heart of her armed forces, as the flagship of her fleets.\nWhere U.S. doctrine places carriers offensively in the structure of its ship-groups, the Vekllei Navy is considerably more Soviet in its employ of carriers as primarily defensive air-bases to exercise sovereignty over her far-flung territories and island possessions. Oa-class Battlecruisers are notable as hybrid carrier-battleships, and feature a diagonal jetway with capacity for carrier-type naval jets (almost indistinguishable in the illustration above) and a variety of VTOL aircraft, which are common by the 2050s.\nFirst built in the 2050s by the sprawling National Naval Arsenal (located on Vekllei‚Äôs Far East coast, close to the foundries that pour her iron), 12 Oa-Class Battlecruisers are in service in the 2070s.

Her unusual serpentine funnel is characteristic of Vekllei‚Äôs navy, and is a distinguishing feature of their naval design language.\nHer hulking superstructure and massive 15-inch fore guns recall the capital battleships of yesteryear, but she is a thoroughly modern battlecruiser with contemporary armament and electrics for combat and fleet administration. Named after Vekllei‚Äôs National flower, these Battlecruisers are the third-largest vessels in the navy and are multifunctional by design, often operated as strategic and operational platforms to support Vekllei‚Äôs large defensive armadas that patrol the North Atlantic.\n She is armed with two triple-barrelled 15-inch shore guns that can be loaded with a variety of shells including nuclear payloads, silos for guided missiles, and specialised guns and missile platforms for anti-ship, submarine and satellite warfare. Her powerful communications array and sensors are positioned 80 meters above the surface for the benefit of radar and subsurface monitoring. She can also support up to 12 standard carrier jets at one time, or 16 individual helijets/VTOL craft.\n Vekllei has larger battlecruisers (the so-called super-battlecruisers match her height and are nearly twice her length) and much larger carriers, but the displacement of the vessel was never a priority.

Fish was traded fresh in markets or turned into emulsifiers and fertiliser.\nThe canals were worked heavily, and few fishing vessels were incorporated. The vast majority of Vekllei‚Äôs fishing fleet was owned by the people that worked them, trading with the Sea Office. From a quaisiosn or ‚Äúcanal park‚Äù you might see a dozen vessels in an hour. Some were run-down prewar things limping out to the shallow coasts, while others were nuclear-powered salmon trawlers designed for the storms of the Atlantic.

A picturesque vision of rural utopia ‚Äî if only they were a part of it.\n"});index.add({'id':38,'href':'/posts/2020-05-16-winter-uniforms/','title':"Winter Uniforms in Vekllei",'section':"Archive",'content':" When I paint Vekllei, I usually depict the warmer months. Hems are shorter, days are longer, and the destabilisation of the world‚Äôs climate has only benefited these arctic people. At the gift end of the Vekllei low pressure system, Scandinavian misery has become Mediterranean pleasure, with warm summers and a mild Autumn and Spring.\nStill, by late October, the the earth is hard with cold and the days are short. The world may be warmer, but Vekllei‚Äôs polar latitude is unchanged, and in the depths of winter the sun only rises for an hour a day. These are Vekllei‚Äôs ‚Äúmoon months‚Äù, and they announce some of the most important spiritual festivals in Upen.\n Although school hours are reduced in winter, life carries on and Vekllei fashion becomes traditionally utilitarian. Tzipora has poor circulation and cold hands even in the warm months, and by November she‚Äôs traded the skirt and gi for traditional rouisha trousers and a cloak. Rouisha, like a lot of traditional clothing, have origins in agriculture and are characterised by a loose, baggy fit and insulated lining. Cobian is wearing a heavy wool sack-type dress, which is worn like an apron over other clothing. Winter brings forth ‚Äúpetticoat society‚Äù literally. Note the leather plate on her shoulder, to which her christmas aiguillette is attached.\n In this sense, Winter‚Äôs revival of traditional clothing and customs further evidences its practice as the most traditional season of the year. Although the warm calendar flourishes with the futurist sympathies of a modernist Vekllei, not even the atomic age has been able to dispense with its hard-worked pragmatism developed in a millennia of bitter cold.\n"});index.add({'id':39,'href':'/posts/2020-05-15-apartment/','title':"2031 Apartment Diagram",'section':"Archive",'content':" Baron had inherited the apartment from his uncle, who passed in the year following his parents. It was in a mixed residential-industrial neighbourhood, adjacent to a canvas factory. Out back was a rivulet, which roared in the long rainstorms of early April.\n Each January, the Colour Bureau of the Architecture Assembly announces the year‚Äôs colours, and tradition in mainstream architecture and interior design is to incorporate the announced palettes, which usually contain a hundred or so colours. His uncle‚Äôs apartment had been built and furnished in 2031, and so it had a #2031 Colour Profile.\n In some ways, it was a very conventional apartment in the Vekllei tradition. It had a sauna and bath in the wetroom, a bidet, a sunken living room and a bread oven. In others, it was more peculiar. The apartment was bizarrely allocated across three levels. You alighted the entrance light well into a sunken living space, then climbed back up into the kitchen. The main living room and master bedroom were another step above the kitchen. Adjacent to the main living area was a closet and study, which overlooked the entrance from a half-meter mezzanine.\nIt was in this study that Tzipora set up shop when she arrived in March 2063. Baron had been reluctant to take her even provisionally, not least because it would mean searching for a new apartment in his busy return period after being abroad for ten years. Tzipora, however, had lived in a dormitory for much of her life and had settled in the alcove once she acquired a dresser screen. She refused outright the master bedroom, which sparked a sleepy agoraphobia. By the time Baron had made other accomodations, Tzipora had entrenched herself in the neighbourhood and had developed a severe sentimentality about the apartment and its rivulet, and so that was where he lived for the rest of his life.\nIn this sense, Tzipora had a strange kinship with the apartment. Baron sealed himself off in the master bedroom each night, but she never left the main living space. It was warm in there, especially in the flickering light of the enormous oven and fireplace, and when she moved the screen aside in the morning her little corner became part of the living area.\nShe had a lot of good memories of that apartment.\n"});index.add({'id':40,'href':'/posts/2020-05-13-tzipostcards/','title':"Announcing Tzipo-stcards",'section':"Archive",'content':" Hello everyone.

She made good time, and after three hours had happened upon the shoulders of the bright Volouisnesnkull Glacier. It was about here that she heard a morbid industrial siren, echoing up the valleys from far away.\nAt first she thought it might have come from Ada, since Boya Chemical had a large plant there, but as she lay out her things for lunch she heard the distinct whine of a turbojet. It grew louder, and deeper, until a National Fire VTOL tanker roared across the sky, swirling powdered snow on nearby peaks as it arced across the glacier. It was close enough to catch the sun ablaze in the reflection of its glass nosecone.\nShe later learned that lava streams had opened up not far from where she‚Äôd hiked, and had been making their way towards a geothermal power plant nestled in the highlands. In the evening, on her way back, she saw a long line of fire supertankers and pumpers spraying water in beautiful arcs, where it caught hisses from bright streams of melted rock. It was a common enough sight in Vekllei ‚Äî hoses were the only defence you could reasonably make against the the fracturing earth.\nStill, it was not often you saw jets flying so low. It was funny to her that even the barren glaciers were tamed in this age.\n"});index.add({'id':42,'href':'/posts/2020-05-06-chemical-feast/','title':"The Chemical Feast",'section':"Archive",'content':" East of Montre, West of Tjornes, waits a rare sight among Vekllei‚Äôs hard igneous slopes ‚Äî a crown of gentle sedimentary cliffs packed with ruddy sandstone, which melt glacially into the sea chasing blue-sky bergs.\nTzipora was, at the time, making her way on foot from Montre-Lola to Ada, which was a coastal town in the North-East known for its luxurious health spas. Tzipora was not much interested in health, but she was interested in walking, and she made a pilgrimage along the coast every few years to make sense of the world. She was going whichaway and destined for nowhere in particular. Tzipora was very much Baron‚Äôs daughter, in the end.\nShe had stopped to see the Red Cliffs forty kilometres out from Tjornes when she saw a cruiser of the constabulary parked unusually by the shore. The constabulary were not local police ‚Äî they were a national outfit tasked with policing government and ‚Äúbureau business‚Äù. You found them at power plants, outside universities, guarding the prime minister and providing bodies for HO/NI (Home Office at National Intelligence) when they needed doors kicked.\nTzipora was not the sort of girl to be intimidated by a badge, and she wandered innocently to the shore where she found the cruiser empty. She looked across a beach of black sand and saw some sort of operation playing out ‚Äî there was a gun boat not too far from the shore, and a police hydrofoil beached on the sand. She counted maybe a dozen officers. She wondered if they‚Äôd arrest her if she walked down to see what was happening. She climbed onto the hood of the cruiser to get a better look. Perhaps it was immigrants ‚Äî or smugglers.\nIt only took another moment to spot the smashed crates broken across the rocks before she knew what was going on. She was witnessing the dying days of the countercultural decade, and its chemical fuel was now smashed open before her.\n The 2070s were a wild time for the so-called ‚Äúpink years‚Äù in Vekllei, and for the first time in Tzipora‚Äôs memory she started seeing ‚Äúpleasure drugs‚Äù on the streets. There had always been plenty of sin carrying on in Vekllei, even in her early days ‚Äî hallucinogenics, alcohol, and synthesised highs were legal and easy. But you didn‚Äôt see much of the exotic stuff, which grew in a better climate. Hash, coke, H ‚Äî it was all underground stuff for personal use. These drugs were listed among many others in the class-A import prohibition orders, which made them hard to find and illegal to import. These were ‚Äúpleasure drugs‚Äù ‚Äî the Vekllei phrase for overseas narcotics that didn‚Äôt have a place in Upen or a preexisting cultural history. Comparatively, they were just ‚Äòfor pleasure‚Äô.\nH for heroin was a big news item for a long time, and with it you had one the largest moral panics in modern Vekllei cultural memory. Crackdowns came soon after. Tzipora found it difficult to describe the feeling of the time. It was a new generation ‚Äî one she didn‚Äôt belong to, despite her appearance ‚Äî and she didn‚Äôt have much sympathy for hedonists. They might tell her different, but she never thought the pink years were about much more than feeling good all of the time. She wondered if she was growing old and grumpy inside.\n She wondered how the crates had got there. Had the coast guard sunk another smugger? You heard about the navy firing shots in the news sometimes.\nRuined with seawater and picked over by constables, the chemical feast of Vekllei‚Äôs pink years died with the times. Tzipora wouldn‚Äôt miss it.\nShe stepped off the hood and set off back towards the road, where a warm inn and hot food awaited her.\n"});index.add({'id':43,'href':'/posts/2020-05-02-trials/','title':"The Trials of Cobian",'section':"Archive",'content':" According to her friends, Tzipora‚Äôs contemporary afflictions were tragic. Her medical problems; her violent childhood; her sensitivity and melancholy ‚Äî you could feel sorry for her, because a lot of her problems were not her fault. She invoked sympathy.\nTzipora never considered herself particularly tragic. It seemed straightforward, if difficult; she continued to live ‚Äî and so she lived. Tzipora\u0026rsquo;s sympathy was instead reserved for her first and closest friend: Cobian.\nCobian was not well-liked at school, and it did not take long for Tzipora to find out why. She had a childish edge for a sixteen-year-old, and bitterly hated losing. She was not good at school or sports, was not particularly charming, and came across as desperately lonely. She was a quiet misandrist, which would have been fine if she could play the part of a self-assured social matriarch, but her mother‚Äôs despotic conservatism struck out that possibility early on. Such is life.\nAnd because her world was predicated on being liked and living a normal life, her psyche prohibited self-reflection. That was the great difference between Cobian and Tzipora. They may both have been young and neurotic, but Tzipora‚Äôs relentless self-interrogation left great space for personal growth. Cobian was instead trapped in a domestic play-fantasy, in which she could live out a mythical high-school life, and shattering that illusion would collapse her whole reason for being.\n Tzipora recalled visiting Cobian‚Äôs home for the first time. Cobian‚Äôs mother asked Tzipora to remove her shoes and socks and wash her feet before going to play inside. By the time Tzipora found Cobian in her room, the girl had already changed and handed over her uniform to be laundered. Tzipora, in her tomboyish indigence, had never encountered such a brutally hygienic regime.\nCobian was a different girl at home. Her anxiety and neurosis washed out a little, and her confidence was propped up by the routines her mother had set out for her since she was a child. There was a friendly, curious girl buried under a decade of loneliness.\n Tzipora wondered what Cobian thought about lying in bed at night, and why the girl worried so much about things that didn‚Äôt matter. And it was precisely in the smallness of those things and the tremendous anxiety Cobian owed toward them that made Tzipora want to hug her. To be so worked up over something so pathetic was startlingly moving. The idea that the girl had deluded herself into a corner of hopelessness seemed sad ‚Äî and the fact that no one would reasonably care about such a feeble, meaningless, self-inflicted state of affairs made it tragic.\nThrough Tzipora‚Äôs friendship and the world it opened up for her, some of Cobian‚Äôs edges were sanded down. Some of it was a late maturity ‚Äî some of it was Tzipora‚Äôs dismantling of the scaffolding the girl‚Äôs mother had shoved in there. With that effort, and obvious love, Cobian‚Äôs reason for being changed too. One day, in Tzipora‚Äôs presence, it didn‚Äôt seem so important to be liked by everybody anymore.\n"});index.add({'id':44,'href':'/posts/2019-08-16-station-dog/','title':"The People of Vekllei‚Äôs Railway (plus Dog)",'section':"Archive",'content':" Station Dogs #  I‚Äôm starting a series looking at the lives and machines of domestic Vekllei life.\nVekllei National Railways, or ‚ÄòVK Rail‚Äô was the bastard of six major pre-war rail companies that were extinguished along with the society that housed them. Today there are three rail companies in Vekllei, but all of them operate under direct supervision of a Vekllei Industry Bureau ( making it Venrouiva, in other words) and are only broken up for reasons of logistics. So even though a train may run under the Montre Inclinantor Rail Company, it is fundamentally a Vekllei National Railways train much in the same way that all regional airlines are actually fully subsumed by Vekllei International Airways.\nA few characters you‚Äôll find at every manned Vekllei station have been illustrated below.\nThe first, the locomotive engineer, drives a train in four hour shifts. They wear a shoulder plate to distinguish them from other miscellaneous station staff and carry a pedigree in Vekllei culture, as a country dependent almost entirely on rail internally.\nEach station has a station master, who manages the station. In small stations, they do many types of work including maintenance and assisting public enquiry. In large stations, like Vekllei Central Terminus, there are dozens of station masters commanding multiple platforms each and are extremely demanding jobs.\nMost stations also have a most unusual employee, nicknamed in Vekllei a ‚Äòdaughter‚Äô or ‚Äòson of the station,‚Äô who are usually children or teen-agers particularly interested in entering employment with Vekllei Rail and are thus apprenticed in many different roles. They are usually taught some English in a special extracurricular programme and are used as guides for tourists, as Vekllei signage is usually written only in the country‚Äôs native tongue. After a few hours of miscellaneous works a child of the station might ride the trains, checking carriages and platforms for cleanliness and observing passenger behaviour.\nMore recently, stations have been adopting station dogs to help lift spirits among commuters and tourists alike. These dogs, usually of breeds too large for Vekllei apartment lifestyles, have no work but to meet people and offer pets to passing commuters. Some are trained in rescue and as service dogs to those who need them, but for the most part they are simply large dogs in uniform who wander with the station master or child of the station to look for love from strangers.\nAt nearly 20,000kms of rail, Vekllei has one of the most dense and intricate rail systems in the world. Stations are built to receive modern transonic maglevs and century-old steam engines simultaneously, and nearly 15,000 people are employed in some form to keep these railways running.\n"});index.add({'id':45,'href':'/posts/2019-07-26-what-is-vekllei/','title':"What is Vekllei?",'section':"Archive",'content':"Vekllei is a country in my alt-world; a utopian fever dream of googie aesthetics, participatory economics and nostalgia.\nWelcome to the ‚ÄòPetticoat Project‚Äô, a collection of stories about a country and a girl.¬†The concept is broken down into three sections:\n Author:¬†for blog posts and articles on the Petticoat Project, utopian fiction, personal news item, etc. Character:¬†for posts about Tzipora, people in her life, or otherwise events that occur during her time on Earth. Landscape:¬†for articles on Vekllei and her society, incorporating all that goes with it.  Otherwise, read on for an introduction to this project and what I intend to do with it.\n The Epilogue to the Epoch of Rest #  The core of the Vekllei project¬†is in understanding utopian fiction as a viable means for expressing yourself in two arenas.¬†Creative, as a way of articulating a worldview, and personal, as a way of introspection and projection.\nIn this case, the creative worldview is that of Vekllei ‚Äî a thought experiment in economics, socialpolitik, infrastructure, architecture, demographics, spirituality, language, actualisation, etc. The personal product is Tzipora ‚Äî a character of good mannerisms, language, sense of fashion, ideological disposition, personality and body.\n The premise of an epoch of rest is that the problems unique to an author, the conductor of the orchestra, can be reasoned with and turned into beautiful monuments in a way they can‚Äôt in reality.\n Running low on money? Vekllei does not use money ‚Äî go to a cinema, eat out; have a nice time. Likewise, are you shameful of your body or your ability? Tzipora is fraught with problems, too ‚Äî but look at her!¬†She is beautiful. Repeat this process for all creative arenas and you will find a world you can escape to, away from the problems of your reality.\nKeep in mind that utopia and perfection are two different things.¬†A city can be utopian without it being perfect ‚Äî a relative judgement. Carrying on in this sense, the concept of utopia can equally be applied to a person. The character is not necessarily a romantic interest or charming or intelligent or sexual product, because none of those things really describe utopia ‚Äî instead, a person (a utopian?) is perfect as a collection of ideas and experience. Vekllei is a place of utopia, Tzipora is utopian. And so there are three actors in this project.\nThe Author #  The producer of the whole thing, the creative and personal products are theirs, as unique as a fingerprint. They most likely produce a lot of different societies and characters in trying to tell a story, or flesh out an idea they‚Äôve had ‚Äî but for the purposes of the idea of an epoch of rest, there are two perfect utopias: landscape (society and the world), and character (personality and appearance).\nVekllei [/v∆êk.la…™/] #  Vekllei is a country in which the external burdens of the world can be shifted. Worries are relegated to the personal ‚Äî an arena in utopian fiction that conveniently still falls under the domain of the author. In Vekllei, self-actualisation is tangible, vivid, only metres away. It might be in creativity or power or love, but it is attainable, because the economic and cultural orchestra of the country is in the imagination of the author, and so it is perfect as by definition of utopia.\nTzipora/Zelda Desmoines [/dz…™pÀà…îÀêr.…ô‚Äôd∆êm.w…ôÀên.∆êÀêh/] #  If Vekllei is the arena of external burden, Tzipora is a girl on which the internal pressures of self-doubt and conscious flaw are cast aside like a rag. In the sense of a narrative, Tzipora might suffer because of her behaviours (her nervous tics, her jealousy, her body and image), but they are adopted in a way that is graceful. So despite her fierce problems, it fades away in the fact that she will not die; she will not be unsuccessful; she will not be unloved. As long as those core premises are true, then every other nervous tic or obsessive-compulsive behaviour are commodity; window-dressing to an aesthetic taste.\nThis project is sort of what I want to do, and I can‚Äôt imagine slowing down anytime soon. Stick around and I‚Äôll do my best materialise the world and story of Vekllei.
