This is a crash course on what this website (and the project at large) is all about.\r\rüöö Under Construction\nThis page is still under construction, and may be incomplete.\r\rüéä The Epilogue of the Epoch of Rest\r#\r\r1. üìÑ What is this project?\r#\r\rVekllei is supposed to be an \u0026lsquo;epoch of rest\u0026rsquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s a project that\u0026rsquo;s become very big, with a long storyline and lots of characters, but at its heart this world is about peaceful escapism and whimsical nostalgia.\nVekllei is a \u0026lsquo;worldbuilding\u0026rsquo; project, which means it doesn\u0026rsquo;t always look like a traditional storytelling endeavour. It introduces parts of an imaginary place that might not be revealed in a traditional linear story.\nVekllei is also a \u0026lsquo;utopian\u0026rsquo; project, which means that it\u0026rsquo;s a form of social dreaming. It\u0026rsquo;s a fantasy built out of the stresses and problems of the present, and so even if Vekllei people might not talk like you or look like you, there\u0026rsquo;s a chance some part of this world may feel like you do.\nThis means that all sorts of themes and influences show up in my work. Vekllei has the language of French-Chinese spoken with an Australian accent, a native people of mixed Inuit-Scandinavian descent, and a modern industrial society that\u0026rsquo;s going backwards.\nFact Sheet\r1.1 Project Fact Sheet  This place is iterative \u0026ndash; canon disappears, people change appearance and the systems of Vekllei twist and turn as I do. This place is good-spirited \u0026ndash; Vekllei is escapism, and although the dark accompanies the light, this project is supposed to be calming and fun. This place is constantly expanding \u0026ndash; I try out new styles, mediums and methods of distribution all the time. Some of them work, some of them don\u0026rsquo;t. I\u0026rsquo;m looking to start a comic and make an animated trailer for the project, so stay tuned for that!  \r\r2. üçç Three Utopias\r#\r\rVekllei is place, but it\u0026rsquo;s also a people, created by Hobart. In this sense, there are three utopias in this project, along which posts are categorised.\n Author \u0026ndash; essays, reflection and discussion Landscape \u0026ndash; guides, diagrams and analysis Character \u0026ndash; stories, moments and memories  So what does \u0026lsquo;utopia\u0026rsquo; mean? It‚Äôs latin for ‚Äúno place‚Äù. It\u0026rsquo;s a forgotten history, a missed opportunity \u0026ndash; a perfect place to escape to. It\u0026rsquo;s a dream facing our past.\n\rVekllei is a very good place to live, but it is not perfect. Although many utopias are presented as perfect Edens of Earth, Vekllei is utopie concret√©. It is a dirty utopia full of the inconveniences, inefficiencies and heartbreak of reality. The idea of my utopia, then, is to settle the bad things of life in a beautiful framework.\nUtopia is a form of social dreaming, much like worldbuilding, linked to the values and priorities of its author. In utopian studies, ‚Äúutopia‚Äù is usually broken down further:\n Eutopia ‚Äî ‚Äúgood place‚Äù Dystopia ‚Äî ‚Äúbad place‚Äù  Note that both form a part of the ‚Äúutopia‚Äù ‚Äî this is appropriate, since Vekllei is grounded in a social realism that acknowledges the good and bad parts of life. Indeed, they are inseparable ‚Äî you cannot have the light without the dark. Such is the internal contradiction of any good utopia.\n2.1 üçà Utopia as Author\r#\r\rThe project is the creation of an Author, the producer of the whole thing. The creative and personal products are theirs, as unique as a fingerprint. They most likely produce a lot of different societies and characters in trying to tell a story, or flesh out an idea they‚Äôve had ‚Äî but for the purposes of the idea of an epoch of rest, there are two perfect utopias: landscape (society and the world), and character (personality and appearance). In this sense, the author is the genesis of the utopia.\n2.2 üçä Utopia as Landscape\r#\r\rUtopias of landscape (the topos) are the stuff you traditionally associate with the utopian tradition \u0026ndash; these are utopias of place. They include utopian cities, states, economies, machines, and any part of local physicality. When I talk about landscape, I use it in one of two ways.\n Landscape as it refers to physical space, like cities, woodlands and oceans. Landscape as it refers to the human metaphysic of place \u0026ndash; the way we build and identify physical spaces in our mind. For example, most people today distinguish between \u0026lsquo;the city\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;nature\u0026rsquo;. In Vekllei, they don\u0026rsquo;t.   Vekllei is a country in which the external burdens of the world can be shifted. Worries are relegated to the personal ‚Äî an arena in utopian fiction that conveniently still falls under the domain of the author. In Vekllei, self-actualisation is tangible, vivid, only metres away. It might be in creativity or power or love, but it is attainable, because the economic and cultural orchestra of the country is in the imagination of the author, and so it is perfect as by definition of utopia.\n 2.3 üçã Utopia as Character\r#\r\rUtopias of character are what I call utopian premises of life experience; stuff you can\u0026rsquo;t construct from stone and concrete. Character utopias make up for the limitations of utopian space by recognising and providing for a new utopian dimension \u0026ndash; people, and personality. If the obsessive utopian can create imaginary communities from social dreams, why not people? Character utopias sum up an ideal life experience, personality, body and taste. Zelda is one such character utopia.\n If Vekllei is the arena of external burden, Tzipora is a girl on which the internal pressures of self-doubt and conscious flaw are cast aside like a rag. In the sense of a narrative, Tzipora might suffer because of her behaviours (her nervous tics, her jealousy, her body and image), but they are adopted in a way that is graceful. So despite her fierce problems, it fades away in the fact that she will not die; she will not be unsuccessful; she will not be unloved. As long as those core premises are true, then every other nervous tic or obsessive-compulsive behaviour are storytelling; window-dressing to an aesthetic taste.\n 3. Where to from here?\r#\r\rMy little \u0026lsquo;epoch of rest\u0026rsquo; is pretty much the only thing I enjoy doing. It\u0026rsquo;s the melting pot of my whole life experience \u0026ndash; from interest and hobbyism to ideology and insecurity. It\u0026rsquo;s the sum of a worldview, a whole person, and to that end I think utopia is a powerful form of self-expression.\nI plan to tell lots of stories in Vekllei in lots of different ways. This wiki is one of them \u0026ndash; it allows me to fill out the world in a new format that better catalogues the scope of this project.\nI also plan to start work on a comic in late October 2020, and in 2021 I intent to produce a short animated trailer for the project. You can follow me along on these adventures on my Discord or the Vekllei subreddit.\nThank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy this adventure in dreaming.\n 4. F.A.Q.\r#\r\rLet\u0026rsquo;s run through some frequently asked questions and common misconceptions about the project.\nWho are you?\nA Tasmanian illustrator.\nYou‚Äôre not Japanese?\n„ÅäÂâç„ÅØ„ÇÇ„ÅÜÊ≠ª„Çì„Åß„ÅÑ„Çã\nWhy is Vekllei a utopia?\nIt makes me feel better about my life and the world.

At least you‚Äôre getting good opinions.\nWhere‚Äôs the tension if it‚Äôs perfect?\nVekllei is very cynical and tragic in places. Utopia is just a reflection of the author, good and bad.\nIs there a novel? A story? A comic?\nI‚Äôm working on a comic right now. I‚Äôm pretty much working on Vekllei full-time so I‚Äôm hoping to announce it soon. I‚Äôve got a lot of different Vekllei projects going.\nWhere is Vekllei?\nIceland.\nWhy does Vekllei look Japanese?\nVekllei is like a country of Scandinavians speaking French with an Aussie accent in Sh≈çwa era Japan/Maoist China/Taiwan etc. Vekllei looks however I imagine utopia looks.\nHow does that make sense?\nWhy can‚Äôt it just be cool?\nIs your alt-history thought out?\nVekllei‚Äôs history is whatever I need it to be. I‚Äôm always trying to be realistic, but it‚Äôs all worked backwards from the setting. I‚Äôm not really ‚Äúworldbuilding‚Äù in a typical sense. Very little of it is published, most of it is retrieved on request. Just ask if you have questions.\nIs Vekllei communist?\nNo.\nBut Vekllei calls itself ‚Äúpetticoat socialist‚Äù.\nVekllei is set in a culture of Marxist revivalism in the 50s and 60s. A lot of Vekllei‚Äôs lexicon is set in that context. Vekllei is a decentralised democracy that doesn‚Äôt use money. It‚Äôs a sort of participatory economy.\nWhy the \u0026ldquo;petticoat\u0026rdquo;?\nVekllei is a female country. Womanhood is decommodified. It\u0026rsquo;s maternal, social and friendly where socialist rhetoric is masculine, technocratic and progressive.\nWho is Zelda?\nZelda is another name for Tzipora. She has two names specifically to confuse you.\nWhat is the ‚Äúbulletin‚Äù?\nI publish the Atlantic Bulletin once a month via email.

The word can be extrapolated in this case in several ways; for one, the book is occupied by worldly, secular affairs, inextricably bound to a particular cultural landscape and absence of metaphysic. Further, as a satirical novel of deep conservative utopian lament, there is a physical, temporal dimension to its present context and history. Finally, the topography of Waugh\u0026rsquo;s novel can be taken literally, as a landscape of modernity (cities) and counter-modernity (rural life), modernism (civilisation) and anti-modernism (savagery). Because of this, there is a playful relationship with Waugh\u0026rsquo;s anti-utopian world and his utopian instincts ‚Äî one that warrants closer analysis. This essay will focus on the dichotomous, often schismatic landscapes at play in A Handful of Dust, and situate it in a modern utopian framework.\nIt is easiest to understand A Handful of Dust in a utopian context when the reader first recognises the novel as a worldview, or as Edward Lobb1 calls it, a ‚Äùpicture of an entire society,‚Äù citing Waugh\u0026rsquo;s employment of Eliot\u0026rsquo;s Waste Land in its title and epigraph p.130. This scope is almost invariably unsentimental, especially in satirical works, and this quirk of genre is calcified into something more deliberate when looking at the novel‚Äôs literary context, which Peter Firchow recognised as a deliberate rejection of Victorian sentimentalism and moral arbitration as characterised by Dickensian literature2 p.415. The satirical edge of the novel‚Äôs climax is only shallowly buried; Nicholas Joost wrote that ‚Äúbeneath the incongruity, there is a chilling propriety. The relationship between Mr Todd and Tony is as Dickensian in kind and proportion as is that between Miss Havisham and Estella in Great Expectations.‚Äù3 p.186\nThe Waugh landscape is marked by unusual topography, where people and places are made foreign through their own alienation from purpose and time. Tony is a secular humanist (evidenced through his irreverence towards faith throughout the novel) dependent parasitically on the romantic nostalgia for the restrained way of life under the Judea-Christian tradition, without the metaphysic provided by pious faith1 p.133. Brenda is a modern woman attached socially and historically to London, the icon of modern (and Victorian) life, which informs her unfaithfulness and various missteps. In fact, nearly every character in the novel suffers from a kind of displacement of both place and intention, which in Waugh\u0026rsquo;s parody of a humanist framework forces a series of unfortunate events that unfold throughout. This all takes place, of course, in the tumultuousness of the interwar years, marked first by hedonism and excess in the 1920s and instability and poverty in the 1930s, the decade in which A Handful of Dust was written. H.G. Wells in his 1933 novel The Shape of Things to Come called it \u0026ldquo;The Age of Frustration,‚Äù for the vast cultural and political changes threatening an unravelling of the world. Waugh, like many of his fellow British authors (including Eliot, Orwell, and Wells himself), hedged existential concerns about the state of his homeland in his work.\nA Handful of Dust is distracted from pure reactionary critique by the (in his mind) far more egregious severing of morality from the metaphysic, and the adoption of previously Judeo-Christian ethics by secular, ungrounded humanist movements. Tony is estranged from real spiritual purpose or existential satisfaction by his secularity and passivity. He spends most of the novel surprised and wounded by sharp moments of tragedy only to be utterly unequipped to deal with them in his total vacuum of Self. In fact, his worldview is less an empty epistemological constellation than it is a fog where no stars or points of reference are visible at all. This culminates, of course, in his ironic fate, in which his old material life essentially reasserts itself in an absurd parody, where his fake, superficial Dickensian existence is resumed against his will in the jungles of Brazil. Quite literally, to Lobb, ‚Äúhis reading of Dickens is a reversion to Victorian sentimentality‚Äù1 p.135, concluding spatially in the same meaningless fantasy as his life at Hetton Abbey.\nSuch is the Waugh‚Äôs illustration of the world in the Age of Frustration, and his fundamental alienation from it. The novel contains not merely glimpses of anti-utopias, but in fact presents a particular anti-utopian philosophy, which can be inverted to better clarify the images of utopia present throughout the work. For example, even though the novel has clear misgivings about the state of England in the late 1930s, the utopian foundation on which A Handful of Dust is built upon nonetheless participates in a philosophy of place, gesturing towards a conservative progression of history. After all, it is not just the revolutionary that understands history as an arc of progress ‚Äî liberals and conservatives alike recognise the horizon, but disagree on the changes made to meet it. Walter Benjamin illustrated this idea cleanly in 1940:\n Progress, as it was painted in the minds of the social democrats, was once upon a time the progress of humanity itself (not only that of its abilities and knowledges). It was, secondly, something unending (something corresponding to an endless perfectibility of humanity). It counted, thirdly, as something essentially unstoppable (as something self-activating, pursuing a straight or spiral path).4 pp.9-10\n Waugh‚Äôs conservatism in a utopian context thus reveals interesting temporal locations through the framework built by sociologist Karl Mannheim. Conservatism, and to a lesser extent liberalism, are fundamentally \u0026ldquo;socially congruent\u0026rdquo; utopias (as opposed, Mannheim supposes, to the socially transcendent topos of the radical and anarchic). White5 expands on this classification, explaining that the differences among utopian sectors \u0026ldquo;are matters more of emphasis than of content,‚Äù since all are fundamentally agents of change p.25. All utopias are efforts to envision and manifest a shift in politics or culture, either consciously in praxis or unconsciously as a collection of values and ideas. Under White\u0026rsquo;s summary, conservatives (to whom Waugh undeniably belongs) are \u0026ldquo;inclined to imagine historical evolution as a progressive elaboration of the institutional structure that currently prevails,\u0026rdquo; where anarchic/radical utopias tend to treat utopia as a non-temporal phenomena that is essentially timeless, dependent only on man\u0026rsquo;s ability to wrest control of their own humanity. Thus is the distinction between ideology and utopia in the inversion characteristic of Mannheim\u0026rsquo;s definitions, where ideology proves socially useful but practically impossible, and utopia is necessary in genuine social change as an element whose \u0026ldquo;ideas and values in which are contained in condensed form the unrealised and the unfulfilled tendencies which represent the needs of each age.\u0026quot;5 p.179 It marks a break from the lineage of utopia\u0026rsquo;s etymology from More\u0026rsquo;s original Utopia. Particularly relevant to Waugh\u0026rsquo;s work here is utopia as a practicable element of social change, as Mannheim writes6 p.178 \u0026ldquo;the road of history leads from one topia over a utopia to the next topia, etc.\u0026rdquo;\nWith Mannheim\u0026rsquo;s redefinition in mind, it is important to assert A Handful of Dust\u0026rsquo;s place in this epistemology. Phillip Wegner notes that the four utopian mentalities outlined by Mannheim (conservative, liberal, radical, and anarchic) are in fact present within their own \u0026ldquo;mode of historical consciousness,\u0026rdquo; existing independently while \u0026ldquo;representing a critical \u0026lsquo;counter-utopia\u0026rsquo; to its three competitors\u0026rdquo; 7 p.192. In this sense, Waugh\u0026rsquo;s conservative utopia is less a concrete set of values and principles than it is a device for clarifying the horizons of political imagination, dynamically reacting to and reflecting the other three corners of possibility.\nYou can see these possibilities through the further inversion of the anti-utopia, like the cyclical nature of faithless humanism. In the case of Tony, the interjection of reality into his absurd fantasy results in an eternity of Hetton-style superficiality manifested literally through Victorian moralism. John Beaver, still materialistic and dependent on his ‚Äúmumsy,‚Äù leaves Britain only to presumably carry on in decadence in Californiap.176. Brenda‚Äôs desire for excitement and romantic satisfaction, meanwhile, leave her alone in the city and without money to sponsor a colourful lifestyle (Characteristically, Waugh does not mince words: ‚ÄúIt was August and she was entirely alone,‚Äùp.193). By the end of the novel, in which the characters themselves are as unresolved as the arc of the story itself, it is clear that the spiritual emptiness that subsumes the purpose of these people is not merely thematic, but is in fact a clarified anti-utopia in itself, not as place but as ‚Äúbody utopias‚Äù 8 p.4. Or rather, anti-utopias of spiritual/sensual gratification. These are people who have no connection to anything fixed or meaningful in their own pasts or culture.\nThis reassessment of utopian writing acknowledges A Handful of Dust not as mere satire for satire‚Äôs sake, but as in fact a vessel of practicable ideas well within potentiality for a hypothetical conservative utopia. After all, should the interwar years have been marked by a series of different events, who is to say Britain might not have become marked at a national cultural level the kind of reactionary nostalgia visible in Waugh\u0026rsquo;s novel? It is not, after all, a simple utopia of place. Jean Ward9 p.679 describes the vision of the novel as a story of \u0026ldquo;human selfishness and self-delusion,\u0026rdquo; in contrast to a simpler misanthropic adventure of human misfortune. This characterisation better illustrates Waugh\u0026rsquo;s pointed absence of framework, or metaphysic, for the world depicted.\nAfter all, it is not as though people will cease to fall out of love, or commit adultery, or accidentally maim children in a world built upon Catholic social norms and the accompanying spiritual bedrock. Nor is it reasonable to suggest Waugh\u0026rsquo;s nostalgia for a pre-war (or pre-modern) England would be blind to the fact that human moral failure would continue to exist. But in the worldview of A Handful of Dust, the characters shown are merely symptomatic of a global cheapness, a sort of international hedonism, that is presented as a sort of era without end. Ann Slater10 notes the novel\u0026rsquo;s displacement of people and intention, citing a recurring motif in which a well-meaning or pleasurable thing is made bad and uncomfortable by its displacementpp.49-66. It is not difficult to find examples of this sardonic irony in the text; Brenda\u0026rsquo;s mourning of the wrong personp.118, and Tony\u0026rsquo;s ironic torturous imprisonment (which takes his pleasures and makes them agony)p.210 are just two examples. In fact, the instances of a correct sentiment or honest effort backfiring and causing trouble so thoroughly pervades the Waugh landscape that it becomes an indispensable part of its satirical edge, culminating in its ironic juxtaposition of life in London against Tony\u0026rsquo;s feverish delusions of the city in the jungle. As Slater notes:\n Civilisation and the savage world fuse. London turns into a desert for Brenda, once Beaver leaves for New York and the entire beau monde goes off cruising in the Mediterranean [\u0026hellip;] Tony, on the other hand, discovers that the bush at night is noisier than a city square.10 p.63\n This fusion of anti-utopian landscape, both as a wasteland composed of good intentions and a jungle of bad outcomes, is an interesting illustration of Waugh\u0026rsquo;s wider satirical targets in the novel. Despite ostensibly satirising the bankruptcy of modern life and its secular humanism, Waugh\u0026rsquo;s ruthless antisentimentality marks A Handful of Dust as a thoroughly modernist novel. Indeed, outside of the aesthetic framework provided by modernism (which Waugh, at least spiritually and politically, rejects), A Handful of Dust was one of many English novels documenting the social disintegration and futility of the modern world. As put by Jonathan Greenburg, ‚ÄúIn Waugh, the satiric and the modem often look very much alike; while the author may claim to satirise a decadent modernity, the disruptive mechanism of his satire fosters the very modem decadence he decries‚Äù11 p.352. The novel is at once a critique and a product of modernism. This dissonance was noted by his biographer as occurring shortly after his entry into the Catholic Church:\n Conversion meant that in one way Waugh had withdrawn from the world of meaninglessness, godlessness, and chaos, yet he remained passionately interested in it, with it if not spiritually or intellectually of it. He could confidently judge and condemn the world he described, but he would not turn away from it.12 p.76\n For Waugh, his conversion equipped him with a worldview that had already been formulating for some years. He was a great believer in the supernatural metaphysics of the Church as a place of order and stability12 p.76, and this would colour his personal politics as well as his personal writing, as well as condemn in his eyes the mortal and material desires of those without faith. A Handful of Dust is a work particularly relevant to his conversion, since an oft-cited quote of his declares the the novel ‚Äúwas humanist and contained all I had to say about humanism.‚Äù13 p.118. According to John Cunningham, ‚Äúin this novel he considered the dead end of a humanism that supposes one may have a moral purpose and yet have no metaphysic in which that purpose is grounded.‚Äùp.118. It was not just a humanist topography in which A Handful of Dust was situated, however. In understanding utopia as a function of place as well as form, it becomes clear that the anti-utopia of the novel is multidimensional, incorporating criticisms of topos as well as body.\nIn his seminal work on the origins of landscape and historicism, Karatani Kojin wrote, \u0026ldquo;in the very moment when we become capable of perceiving landscape, it appears to us as if it had been there, outside of us, from the start‚Äù14 p.34. So too does the iconography of \u0026ldquo;old England\u0026rdquo; illustrated in A Handful of Dust suppress its origins as landscape as soon as it is introduced. Most obviously, the \u0026ldquo;old country\u0026rdquo; of Hetton Abbey is expressed only in transcendental terms and is thoroughly defamiliarised. It is, in effect, not a place at all, but a sham landscape only supported by the value given to it by the Lasts (which further recalls Eliot‚Äôs poem in the epigraph; ‚ÄúThese fragments I have shored against my ruins‚Äù). To further draw on Karatani: ‚ÄúIt brings into existence landscapes which, although they had always been there, had never been seen\u0026rdquo;p.29. This then informs the ability of the novel to set within it subjects and objects of action, as it is important to recognise the subjects and objects of action arise from within a landscape upon discovery, rather than having existed as immutable factsp.34. Tony is thoroughly alienated from landscape as it is depicted in the novel; it is only appropriate, then, that he struggles to find an appropriate metaphysical foundation for his existence. The discovery of landscape predates modernism as Waugh understands it, but it remains in fact a modern creation brought about the artistic and religious reformations of centuries prior (namely protestant reformations, notable in context of Waugh\u0026rsquo;s catholicism). As described by Gleiter:\n The modern Self is indebted to a process of extraneation which is also a process of objectification. Both the landscape and the Self become alien and enigmatic, and these, precisely, are the qualities that made them visible.15 p.73\n Furthermore, Hetton Abbey is acknowledged as a Victorian Gothic reconstruction, a revivalist style that reflects his romantic fetishisation of the preindustrial and rural1 p.131. The investment of his spirit into an inauthentic commodity grotesquely acknowledges his spiritual bankruptcy, which cascades into all parts of his delusions (his inability to respond to the death of his son and his wife\u0026rsquo;s unfaithfulness, etc.). Firchow describes Hetton as ‚Äúroughly from the same period of Dickens‚Äô novels; both seem to represent the last gasping certainties of an old order. And both, by implication, are possibly intended to be recognised as shams‚Äù2 p.415. Even his response to grief is filtered through this plastic understanding of the world, as Tony exclaims, ‚ÄúA whole Gothic world had come to grief.., there was now no armour, glittering in the forest glades, no embroidered feet on the greensward; the cream and dappled unicorns had fled\u0026hellip;\u0026quot;p.147.\nThe reconfiguring of landscape as iconography also enables Waugh to further satirise the characters of the novel, and strip back their agency as a consequence of their own hedonism. Brenda is suffocated socially by Tony‚Äôs blind love for the Abbey; Tony is trapped by Mr Todd in the Brazilian jungle; Mr Todd is trapped by his illiteracy, and so on. Indeed, the book concludes on a cage of silver foxes. Through their social and physical imprisonment, the people of the novel are better illustrated against both the hellish topos and their own critical character flaws that prevent them from breaking out of their cyclical lifestyles. Their spiritual emptiness is reflected in their ability to take the metaphysical institutions of life seriously, and renders them (socially and in their ability to enact change over their own lives) as children10 p.61. John Beaver, in his poverty and dependence on his mother, seems to typify this psychospiritual bankruptcy, but the patronising tone of the novel leaves few characters unmarked. Nowhere is this more apparent than when Jock finally presents the request regarding the importation of pork pies on behalf of his constituents, only to bungle the department to which he was supposed to address it. Waugh‚Äôs sardonic line encloses this caricature of the man: ‚ÄúJock left the House that afternoon with the comfortable feeling that he had at last done something tangible in the interest of his constituents‚Äù.p.216\nWith the intensity of the satirical edge in A Handful of Dust, it is only suitable that its anti-utopian foundations are expressed with great clarity. The defamiliarisation (and often outright absence of sympathy) for the people of this book only serve to better collapse the sort of Victorian sentimentalism to which Waugh seems averse. Just as Tony is isolated from sincere accomplishment of preindustrial, rural nobility by his time in history and material circumstance, so too are his metaphysical aspirations undermined by their baselessness. To the Catholic Waugh, the idea of morals without metaphysic is vacuous and empty of real substance. Similarly, Waugh‚Äôs perceived savagery embedded within civilisation is not just as a condemnation of changing cultural icebergs, but a literalist judgement of the products of modernists ‚Äî that is to say, modern people. Waugh presents a paper landscape and plastic people, and through a simple inversion it easy enough to pull genuine utopian social dreaming from this novel. Utopia undeniably exists in the conservative anti-utopia, and in the case of A Handful of Dust, it invokes a broader context of a unique period of time for British literature, one marked by material uncertainty and cultural retreat. For that reason, Waugh‚Äôs A Handful of Dust is an undeniably important work of fiction, both as a biting critique of modernism (which itself has long-since given way to later movements) and as a zeitgeist for conservative apprehension in a remarkable period of history.

I use an iPhone paired to an Apple Watch and AirPods on the go, a MacBook Air at home, and an AppleTV in the living room. A bit more wilful consumerism, and I could complete my collection ‚Äî a HomePod, or $6000 ProDisplay XDR perhaps. I like my RAM soldered to the board, ladies and gentlemen.\nI am also a vocal critic, through my art and politics, of commodity culture and modern consumer society. Congratulations if you\u0026rsquo;ve picked up on what you might recognise as a contradiction. I talk big about human life emptied out and objectified through industrial society, while shilling for the worst kind of tech ‚Äî consumer tech ‚Äî and the worst kind of consumer tech ‚Äî locked down, closed in, proprietary walled garden expensive tech. I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is hypocritical, necessarily. People are complex, and I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t disparage someone for etching out pleasure through consumption if that\u0026rsquo;s what it takes to keep going in our shell-world. But I\u0026rsquo;d like to address my consumerism here.\nI\u0026rsquo;m pretty much stuck in the Apple ecosystem, whether I like it or not (I do, in fact, like it). This wasn\u0026rsquo;t always the case. I bought my first iPhone as a teenager, an iPhone 6 Plus, but traded it in for the objectively shitty and wonderful Nexus 5X in my senior year. I used that until it desoldered itself through its insane thermal issues. I went back to my 6 Plus, then bought the Google Pixel 2 XL when it came out. I bought a Google DayDream (a VR headset) with it, and came dangerously close to buying an Android watch (a prescient moment). This isn\u0026rsquo;t evidence of impartiality, or a defense against accusations of fanboyism. It\u0026rsquo;s evidence of my preference for vertical integration, control, permanence and the product-form.\nTech is an intimate part of life, so why shouldn\u0026rsquo;t we see ourselves in tech? My feelings towards products are generally dependent on my personal intuition, not their specs or costs. The things I have in my life aren\u0026rsquo;t tools, they\u0026rsquo;re appliances; objects, and should delight you in their good design and usefulness. I suppose there\u0026rsquo;s a spiritual component to it, and I won\u0026rsquo;t apologise for that. It bubbles up from an instinct for control, unity and simplicity. This does not apply exclusively to Apple products, this is more fundamental than that ‚Äî it folds into a larger conception of appliances and design. I might get caught up in a hype cycle, or drink the kool-aid on a few occasions, but this isn\u0026rsquo;t intellectual, it\u0026rsquo;s instinctive, and it informs much more than petty consumerism.\nThere are good reasons why Vekllei is so cleanly vertically integrated, so culturally homogenous, and so absolute in its absence of money. These aspects of my work arise from the same instinct that determines one perfect language; one perfect religion; one perfect uniform; one perfect architecture. It is not that a moneyless utopia is an interesting thought-experiment; it\u0026rsquo;s that a utopia could only be moneyless. This is a binary instinct ‚Äî it is, or it isn\u0026rsquo;t. It evolves constantly with taste.\nWalter Isaacson, in the biography of Steve Jobs, wrote of his legacy:\n [Jobs\u0026rsquo;s] intensity encouraged a binary view of the world. Colleagues referred to the hero/shithead dichotomy. You were either one or the other, sometimes on the same day. The same was true of products, ideas, even food: Something was either ‚Äúthe best thing ever,‚Äù or it was shitty, braindead, inedible. As a result, any perceived flaw could set off a rant. The finish on a piece of metal, the curve of the head of a screw, the shade of blue on a box, the intuitiveness of a navigation screen‚Äîhe would declare them to ‚Äúcompletely suck‚Äù until that moment when he suddenly pronounced them ‚Äúabsolutely perfect.‚Äù He thought of himself as an artist, which he was, and he indulged in the temperament of one.1 p.309\n I\u0026rsquo;ve seen people diagnose Jobs as autistic, an insult to both autistic people and Jobs. Jobs was well aware of his apparent cruelty, and finely socially attuned. Steve Jobs, by any account, was a deeply flawed human individual with a very sincere belief in good taste and design. Another passage recalls his incompatibility with a girlfriend:\n They also had a basic philosophical difference about whether aesthetic tastes were fundamentally individual, as Redse believed, or universal and could be taught, as Jobs believed. She accused him of being too influenced by the Bauhaus movement. ‚ÄúSteve believed it was our job to teach people aesthetics, to teach people what they should like,‚Äù she recalled. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt share that perspective. I believe when we listen deeply, both within ourselves and to each other, we are able to allow what‚Äôs innate and true to emerge.‚Äù1 p.158\n There are plenty of rude visionaries in Silicon Valley, and so-called \u0026ldquo;tech culture\u0026rdquo; is empty and superficial. But few people possess the sort of magical intuition Jobs had, or his deep appreciation for taste and design. Plenty of companies innovate, but Apple strikes me as a principles company. It makes decisions that make no market sense, like cutting the headphone jack, which generated far more negative press than short-term sales in bluetooth headphones.\n I think most creative people want to express appreciation for being able to take advantage of the work that‚Äôs been done by others before us. I didn‚Äôt invent the language or mathematics I use. I make little of my own food, none of my own clothes. Everything I do depends on other members of our species and the shoulders that we stand on. And a lot of us want to contribute something back to our species and to add something to the flow. It‚Äôs about trying to express something in the only way that most of us know how‚Äîbecause we can‚Äôt write Bob Dylan songs or Tom Stoppard plays. We try to use the talents we do have to express our deep feelings, to show our appreciation of all the contributions that came before us, and to add something to that flow. That‚Äôs what has driven me.\n I believe deeply that design matters, and that the stuff around us should reflect that.\nCited Works\r#\r\r  Isaacson, W. (2011). Steve Jobs.

It is perhaps my favourite city in the world. On sweltering days, what sounds like raindrops smack the pavement as hundreds of air-conditioning units drip liquid into the streets below. In North Point, you might as well be fifty years back in time. Thin double-decker trams ding-ding-ding their way through crowded market streets with smells pungent enough to turn your stomach in the humid air. New tower blocks develop a run-down patina in a matter of years. Everyone is shouting, all of the time.\nEnough people have asked me to share my experience in Hong Kong that I‚Äôve decided to get around to doing it. I was reluctant for a few reasons. The first is that I felt I didn‚Äôt have anything particularly profound to say (it recalls white tourists returning home from building a cowshed in Vietnam and describing how seeing poverty really, like, made them grateful). The second was that there are enough Western voices telling us how to feel about police brutality and freedom movements, and I don‚Äôt see how my anecdotes would contribute to anything but further anxiety and sorrow for Hong Kong. I am not some kind of saviour, or for that matter a journalist. I did not do anything good for Hong Kong. I don‚Äôt see how I‚Äôve earned my right to talk about it. So treat this only as a collection of thoughts, influenced and calcified by my time in a wonderful city.\nDo not go to Hong Kong right now unless you‚Äôre willing to get hurt for it. These are not localised outbreaks of violence. In Tsim Sha Tsui, the trendy shopping heart of Hong Kong, I saw a female tourist carried out of a tear smoke plume by her partner. I next saw her laid out several streets away amidst protester paramedics. It can be difficult to tell which places are safe, even when trying to avoid or escape a protest. I had not realised I was across from a besieged police station when I first had a taste of tear smoke. I hadn‚Äôt seen the smoke warning flags or police lights.\nThe night after the events of TST, the police used tear smoke in an underground MTR station. It should not take an expert to realise why using chemical weapons in an enclosed, unventilated space is an escalation of police violence. Quite frankly, considering the scale of the protests and the hostility of the HK riot police, it is only chance that someone hasn‚Äôt been killed (or at least confirmed to be). Hong Kong is a gorgeous, wonderful city, but the risks are obvious and largely unavoidable.\nI recall running with some strangers to the corner of Haiphong and Nathan Road, where an MTR station was still operating, as three busses of riot police arrived and unloaded onto the pavement beside me. The protests on Nathan Road clearly hadn‚Äôt dispersed to their liking. I was there by chance, doing tourist things. They were carrying tear smoke guns and shields. It is very surreal to be surrounded by some of the most valuable commercial real estate in the world, stocked with Tiffany Blue gift boxes and BVLGARI fragrances, only to be racing riot police to the station entrance before the metro shut down. The following night, my hotel in North Point boarded up its doors in preparation of a riot between protesters and pro-Beijing counterprotesters. I hung around for a while, but it seemed the protesters were smart enough to avoid North Point that night. My point is that, after dark, tourist impulses to see sights and enjoy good food will lead you into an escalating civil disturbance that has been ongoing for nearly three months now.\nWhat are we, the world, supposed to do about Hong Kong? Just this week, protesters marched on the U.S. embassy waving American flags. What do they expect the Yanks to do? Appear off-shore with a aircraft carrier as a show of force? Despite the sacrifice of Hong Kongers at home and abroad, the dialogue still seems to be not of Hong Kong and her future, but of China. Even if every demand should be met, the ‚Äútwo systems, one country‚Äù promise will expire in a few decades, and what do we plan to do about it then? Dump more opium into China and demand Hong Kong back?\nDespite my unwavering solidarity with Hong Kongers and their struggle, I find myself reeling from the gloating of our media, on social networks and in print, over the grisly iconography of the protests. Crows and carrion, I say. We don‚Äôt really intend to do anything about it ‚Äî China could perpetrate another massacre and we‚Äôd only wring our hands about the incivility of it all. Who would we sanction the Chinese mainland from? Ourselves? We‚Äôve spent the entire post-war era comfortably offloading our manufacturing into the cheap, exploited labour markets of East Asia. Are we willing to sacrifice our entire manufacturing base over the blood of Hong Kongers?\nJournalists scribble. Social media lurkers like. Politicians wrestle with the reality that our mother country‚Äôs navy is no longer able to stomp about the world anymore. Even America, our World Police, seem to be flexing only their civil service ‚Äî intensifying bureaus and firing up cabinet meetings. So what are we, the world, supposed to do about Hong Kong?\nI watched thousands of Hong Kongers risk livelihoods and safety, only to return to the infantilising paternalism of Western commentary, with loaded notions of Hong Kong as a ‚ÄòWestern pocket‚Äô of Asia, flicking between sympathy theatre and condemnation of Beijing. It seems disingenuous and lurid, and although our free press is more decent about the matter than the Chinese state media could ever be (my Twitter in Hong Kong was sponsored exclusively by Chinese newspapers decrying the violence of protestors), it‚Äôs nonetheless uncomfortable for me to tout my own righteous, democratic superiority when all my morals and all my democracy leave me useless in the face of Chinese hegemony.\nIt‚Äôs left me burnt out and cynical in a way that tear smoke and street fires never could. There is spirit and vigilance in the protests in Hong Kong, but we live in a world of global trade and information overload. Hong Kong is very small place, and the world is very big. Our sympathy does the reality of the situation no good.\nHong Kong is not the tipping point ‚Äî Hong Kong is the first of an ongoing shift of power in our region. There will be more crises like Hong Kong, and our neutered ability to cohesively respond to them without drawing upon our supposed moral superiority is a weakness. China does not understand Western presence and commentary in Hong Kong as a democratic effort ‚Äî it sees it as the legacy of imperial ambition and colonial politics. How much of Australian shock and outcry is about reconciling our own powerlessness with our principles? What good is an opinion of the People‚Äôs Republic or of the HK police? We recognise the distastefulness and incivility of violence, but that does little to influence the imbalance of power spilling blood in Hong Kong right now.\nAwareness is not enough ‚Äî we‚Äôre only a few taps and two clicks away from live minute-by-minute updates of every tear shed in the ongoing protests. There are thousands of journalists in Hong Kong covering every angle of police brutality. And yet the violence goes on‚Ä¶\nThis is my announcement that I am, in fact, useless ‚Äî that for all my Australian pretensions of decency and agency, the situation has changed not one bit. I thus volunteer my honourable withdrawal from the Discourse. All I‚Äôll say is this:\nHong Kong is the first of many. Consider what Hong Kong means to you, and what you can do about it.\n"});index.add({'id':12,'href':'/docs/millmint/vekllei/society/people/','title':"People",'section':"Vekllei Society",'content':"Starred Article\nThis article is complete.

It is much older than Topet, and has more in common with spiritual runes than modern logography. Potenne, lit. ‚ÄúHand-Talk‚Äù, is a sign language that incorporates gestures and signing to add meaning to emotion to spoken language, and occasionally in place of it. Upotenne, lit. ‚ÄúSpirit-Hand-Talk‚Äù, as the recreation of runes in human form, used limitedly in spiritual ritual. Vekllei Semaphore is the codification of colour and shape.

Participatory Economics in Utopia\r#\r\r1.1. Introduction\r#\r\rThe daily functioning of the Vekllei economy is as miraculous as it is unique. Key organs and mechanisms of the Vekllei economy reality are positioned against or outright opposed against each other. And a startling series of contradictions \u0026ndash; one after the other, each more unusual than the last. Vekllei is a planned economy; it is also a free market. Property ownership is obfuscated by portioned sovereignty of land and product. Decommodification has devalued products in a country based on manufacturing. There are many contradictions, inefficiencies and simply unusual mechanisms in the Vekllei domestic market, and this article hopes to elucidate at least some of them.\nThe Bureau System, sometimes called Product Socialism, is the name by which Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s economy is most often described. A primitive form was found in the anarchy in the wake of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s atomic bombing, but by 2020 it was written into the document that would become Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s postwar constitution.\n\rPrior to the Atomic War, Vekllei was a closed, protectionist market under rule of a monarchy puppeted by a military junta. A backwards and quaint country for much of its 20th century, there is no period in Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s history which we might describe as \u0026ldquo;industrial capitalism\u0026rdquo;. It is in this context, in the ashes of the Atomic War and under British occupation, that we can sympathise with the barter economy that would eventually modernise into the Bureau System, a thoroughly unique economic ideology in the world today.\n\r\rWhat makes the Bureau System unique? Simply that, in common contexts, no money exists in Vekllei whatsoever. This is moneylessness in spirit, too \u0026ndash; there are no currency substitutes, be they labour vouchers or ration systems. This initial fact of life and symptom of destitution is now codified and vigorously defended by the Vekllei state, making the country the only example of a moneyless state of its size in the world.\nThe abolition of currency is allowed by two facts:\n1. A general post-scarcity and surplus of goods. \r2. The inefficiencies of a profitless market compensated by the total abolition of waged labour/labour costs. The function fo Vekllei\r\r\r1.2. Principles\r#\r\rThe economy informs the high standard of living, but also influences architecture, culture and even the Vekllei person himself. In the context of the Vekllei participist economy, even the notions of manhood and womanhood are reorganised around the basic principles of the economy, which are themselves symptoms of Vekllei‚Äôs history, landscape and culture.\nThe core principles of Vekllei‚Äôs parecon, usually identified by name as petticoat society, are as follows:\n Self-management and self-interest through Sundress Municipalism. Classification of property as an independent social organ, like nature. Abolishment of currency and currency-substitutes. Participatory employment. Economic feminisation.  1.3. Culture\r#\r\rMost unusual is Vekllei‚Äôs cultural phantom of property and its absence in business and the home. That is not to indicate a tendency of either private or shared commodity, but rather an absence of commodity altogether ‚Äî a fiscal kingdom divorced entirely from neighbouring notions of property, usurped instead by a common understanding of cityscape and objects alike as products of nature, capable neither of possessing or communalising it, codified mostly by a cultural intuition that forms one part of the Vekllei idea of ‚Äòownership‚Äô.\nYes, these people do not recognise property in their domestic lives, nor do they carry with them any currency or currency-substitute (labour vouchers, crediting systems, etc.) ‚Äî but to describe the economic function of society as simply utopian in the fashion of 19th century fiction-writers would be misleading. Vekllei is a miracle produced in the intersection of culture and power that have determined national priority since the First Atomic War. Vekllei is not a blueprint or mathematical template, and appears to be so far irreproducible abroad. This could be because of any or all of the following:\n\r Vekllei is perhaps the most highly concentrated country of its size on Earth ‚Äî 80 percent of the 20 millions that call it home are located in the wide urban region referred to as the Capital and the city-state of Vekllei. Indeed, domestically the entire inhabited coastline is considered to be part of one large, singular city community. Vekllei was devastated entirely by the First Atomic War, which extinguished the protectionist Denoisesn regime and left the urban centres bare of infrastructure, allowing architects and urban planners to implement a so-called ‚Äògarden city‚Äô design in the principle of traditional Vekllei spiritualism. Vekllei does not suffer from internal factionalism of the other great powers, and is ethnically and culturally homogenous. The modern Vekllei economy bypassed liberalisation of trade entirely through its monarchical-authoritarian-utopian progression, and has no nostalgia for either currency or real market economics. Most crucially, the last fifty years of advanced robotics has essentially relegated vast swaths of the labour of the majority of her workforce as unnecessary, or comfortable. Automation is not universal, and so all people must work in fairness, but society has reorganised around professional hierarchies where every person casts their lot in at the lowest rung ‚Äî essentially, in theory, alleviating work as anything other than hobby.  So Vekllei has an unusual system that is desperate to consume work-hours. It is labour-intensive where wanted, alleviated by industrial machinery where preferred, and completely automated where necessary.\r\r\r2. Petticoat Socialism\r#\r\r3.

Overview\r#\r\r1.1 Introduction\r#\r\rTzipora Desmoisnes (also Zelda lo Ula de Helette Desmoisnes, born May 5 2047) is a Vekllei Gregori Baby and librarian, and is the character utopia of the Petticoat Project. Born to artist and political activist Mette Sumoisnesn and an unknown father, the family moved to Colombia when Tzipora was six months old. Her return to Vekllei as a teen-ager would mark her integration into Vekllei society and her diagnosis as Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s first victim of Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome.\nTzipora is characterised by her intense disposition and conservative tastes, informed in part by her youth in Colombia and the United States. Although she is naturally self-sustaining and independent, she dearly loves her adoptive father Baron Desmoisnes and family friend Ayn Rumouisen, and holds affectionate, close relationships with those important to her.\n\r\r\rTzipora struggles with shell-shock, which interferes with her sleep and is spurred by several triggers, including large dogs and lying on her chest. Her nervous behaviour manifests in various tics, most obviously pulling and rubbing of her clothes and nose. She is relatively unknown in Vekllei, except as an occasional medical curiosity, but is somewhat renowned internationally as the oldest surviving Gregori Baby.\nAfter the American invasion of Colombia in 2057, Mette paid an education broker several thousands of pesos to arrange Tzipora‚Äôs education in California. Although Tzipora would graduate in 2061, she had lost contact with her mother and had lapsed on her education visa. Without an allowance and barred from legitimate work, she moved to Utah the same year in search of income.\nAfter finding work as a maid and residence at a women‚Äôs shelter, Tzipora witnesses to much of the industrial unrest in Utah in the early 2060s. After being threatened and nearly murdered by strikebreakers for her tacit association with the United Mine Workers, at that time an illegal organisation, she met Baron Desmoisnes, an agent of the Vekllei Americas Bureau at National Intelligence. In 2063, she would flee Utah under his advice and return to Vekllei as an expatriated citizen.\nSince arriving in Vekllei at the age of 16, Tzipora has received two doctorates from Montre University and currently works as a community librarian in the small Montre village of Montre-Lola, where she is well-loved.\n2. Early Life\r#\r\rBirth in Ro\r#\r\rMette Sumoisnesn\r#\r\rMette became pregnant aged 22 during her revival as an underground sculpture artist. Unsure of whether she was ready to raise a child, she later returned home to her family home for the first time in six years on the advice of her friends. The following Autumn, Tzipora was born.\nShe was delivered at the Ro Maternity Clinic without a father, since Mette was involved with several partners at the time.\nChildhood in Colombia\r#\r\r3. Education in the United States\r#\r\r2057 (First Year)\r#\r\rShaky beginnings\r#\r\rIn 2057, Tzipora began her first year at St Mary\u0026rsquo;s Catholic College in Sacramento at age 10.\n2058 (Second Year)\r#\r\r2059 (Third Year)\r#\r\r2060 (Fourth Year)\r#\r\rAn illicit relationship\r#\r\rBy early summer in 2060, Tzipora came to rely emotionally on John Suzak, her mathematics teacher. The intensification of her feelings for him culminated in July, when Suzak discussed taking her to Disneyland. Although nothing would come of these plans, they would come back to haunt Tzipora.\nSchool Pariah\r#\r\rBy August 2060, Suzak had been quietly reassigned by the school board and disappeared from classes soon after. His predation on students had been an open secret, and rumour of his lovers soon focused on one of his students, a sixteen-year-old named Sue Jacobson. Suspicion was raised further by Jacobson\u0026rsquo;s absence from classes in the month following Suzak\u0026rsquo;s departure, leading to speculation by her peers that she had run off with him. By the time Jacobson returned to school in September, she found herself the subject of intense ridicule and gossip.\nAlthough Jacobson was never sure of who Suzak\u0026rsquo;s other girlfriends were, her friend Dolly told her that Tzipora, with whom she shared a dorm, had visited Disneyland with him in August. Hoping to distract attention from herself, Jacobson told peers that Tzipora had fallen pregnant while vacationing with him at Disneyland, which was why she\u0026rsquo;d been in the hospital. Although it was a preposterous fabrication, and Tzipora had never been to Disneyland or so much as kissed a boy, she was already regarded as a loser among her classmates and the rumour quickly stuck.\nEven though most quietly considered Jacobson to have been Suzak\u0026rsquo;s illicit lover, Tzipora was an easy target and much of the ridicule was directed towards her. Although public bullying quickly settled in the weeks following, most of her classmates would never quite see Tzipora the same way. Worst of all, the rumour had spread throughout her year and the school, and had poisoned most people\u0026rsquo;s impressions of Tzipora before they\u0026rsquo;d met her. Tzipora, for her part, struggled to defend herself \u0026ndash; she\u0026rsquo;d never been to Disneyland, and had never been pregnant, but it was true that she\u0026rsquo;d had a crush on Suzak. The grain of truth was enough to falter her confidence in defence.\nTzipora failed most of her exams in October, in part because of the stress the incident with Suzak had caused her. After her mother failed to return her letters sent in early December, Tzipora was rapidly becoming convinced that she was now alone in the world.\nA Physical Toll\r#\r\rAround the time the bullying started, Tzipora fell ill from the stress. Although she would later remark that her visible tics were brought about by her time in Utah, the truth was that she first exhibited physical tics sometime during her experience in September-thru-November. Even when mildly anxious she would cover her speech with pulling and tugging on her shirt, and would wipe her nose with her fingers and hand incessantly.\n2061 (Final Year)\r#\r\rA Lonely New Year\r#\r\rSue Jacobson\u0026rsquo;s Arrest\r#\r\rIn March, Dolly, who had told the falsehood about Tzipora and Suzak going to Disneyland, had a falling out with Sue Jacobson. Shortly after, when confronted about lying about Jacobson in class, Dolly let slip that it was Jacobson who was the liar, as Jacobson had lied about Tzipora\u0026rsquo;s pregnancy in the first place. This information made its way back to Tzipora, whose bewilderment at the mundanity of Jacobson\u0026rsquo;s reasoning quickly transformed into rage.\nAlthough powerless to act out her revenge fantasies, Tzipora kept a close eye on everything Jacobson did from then on. Then, in May, shortly after Tzipora\u0026rsquo;s 14th birthday, an opportunity presented itself.\nOne week to the day after Tzipora\u0026rsquo;s birthday, Jacobson left her schoolbag behind in the classroom while the class changed for gym class. Tzipora, who had received permission from the nurse to sit out activities, quickly seized on her absence and began rummaging through her belongings, looking for something to steal or destroy. She came across Jacobson\u0026rsquo;s diary, which, among other things, mentioned Jacobson\u0026rsquo;s involvement with a book club run by her cousin. Taking note of the names in her contacts and looking to cause trouble, Tzipora placed an anonymous tip with the police that a girl in her class was organising communist support among the students.\nUnknown to Tzipora was that the book club in question occasionally circulated banned literature, and an investigation the day after the call revealed anarchist works hidden in Sue\u0026rsquo;s dorm. Sue Jacobson, her cousin, three other girls from St Mary\u0026rsquo;s and six other people in total were arrested in the weeks following. Most, Sue among them, were sentenced to 8 years in prison after an investigation by the House Committee for Unamerican Activities. Six months later, in November, John Suzak would also be arrested in connection to the circulation of terrorist works.\nTzipora, terrified by her actions and that she might be implicated, found herself concerned for her safety. Unable to contact her mother and with her school debt due in June, Tzipora began to make plans to pool the last of her money and travel back to Colombia, hopefully finding her mother there.\n4.

Characters\r#\r\r2.1 üçÅ Tzipora (Zelda) Desmoisnes\r#\r\r\rTzipora is the main character and character utopia of this project.\n2.1.1 Personality\r#\r\rThere are a lot of things Tzipora does differently to everybody else, and they start to make a lot more sense when you realise Tzipora either does not realise she is unusual, or does not care.\nShe has a lot of endearing characteristics that give great character to her mannerisms and physicality. She has a small overbite that makes her look a little froggy, and ritually pulls on her shirt and wipes her nose in anxious conversation. She is round-headed and cuts her hair herself. She talks in a low, expressive voice. She has been poorly socialised in childhood, and is afraid of casual conversation with people she does not know. She is keenly socially attuned and feels awkwardness painfully.\nShe wears the same clothes two or three days in a row. The outfits themselves are variations of the same thing, and her tastes don‚Äôt change. Everything hangs off her ‚Äî she likes baggy, airy clothing, and upsizes to accomodate. She doesn‚Äôt like fashionable or voguish people, whom she regards as decadent and offensive. To Tzipora, taste is timeless and bound to the soul. In her case, this fact has held true ‚Äî she has dressed the same as childhood, and very little else has changed about her in that time.\nShe is paranoid and conservative, good-natured and austere, with a moral outlook bound by her deepest anxieties and obsessions. She is deeply spiritual and material, fascinated with objects and their history. She has many collections of many things she‚Äôs found. She‚Äôll likely die a Catholic, but has a confrontational relationship with God and no longer attends mass, as a declaration of humanism. She does not know if this has pissed Him off, but it‚Äôs working out so far. Maybe that‚Äôs why He made her a homosexual ‚Äî to get back at her. He must have a good sense of humour, if that‚Äôs the case.\nTzipora may be intense and inward-facing, but she can also be disarmingly charming and self-deprecating. She has a good sense of humour. There are not many girls that can so easily reconcile the contradictions between the peculiar and the healthy, the eccentric and the friendly, and the violent and the domestic. That‚Äôs part of her character ‚Äî an essence of being that radiates decency, good taste and a respect for the spirit of all things.\n2.1.2 Fact Sheet\r#\r\r2.2 üå≥ Cobian Queismesnah\r#\r\rPersonality\r#\r\rFact Sheet\r#\r\r2.3 üåµ Moise Hasapis\r#\r\rPersonality\r#\r\rFact Sheet\r#\r\r2.4 üåæ Baron Desmoisnes\r#\r\rPersonality\r#\r\rFact Sheet\r#\r\r2.5 üçÑ Ayn Rumouisen\r#\r\rPersonality\r#\r\rFact Sheet\r#\r\rNotes\r#\r\r"});index.add({'id':18,'href':'/docs/millmint/bulletin/2020/1/','title':"Issue 1 | May 2020",'section':"2020 Issues",'content':"üåº The Atlantic Bulletin\r#\r\r Issue #1 | Petticoat Bulletin from Studio MillMint | May\r#\r\r 2020 | Â§ßË•øÊ¥ã„Éû„Ç¨„Ç∏„É≥ is published monthly.

II. Tzipora-watch\r#\r\rMay 5th is Tzipora‚Äôs birthday. She spends her birthday with Baron and Ayn; her friends are relegated to the day after.\n III. Vekllei Fact of the Month\r#\r\rYou might be aware of venrouive and senrouive property, which mark ‚Äòessential‚Äô and ‚Äòpersonal‚Äô business respectively, but there is also a rarely-used third classification called uousinasenrouive. This means, roughly, ‚Äúproperty-obligation‚Äù. These places require a physical obligation from their owners, usually a debt owed to the history of the place. For example, an apartment above a bakery would usually fall under such a category, since living there would require operation and maintenance of the business also. Uousinasenrouive are very common in Vekllei, and many older residences involve these work obligations.\n IV. The Bulletin\r#\r\rFission Cloud at Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s 50th Anniversary\r#\r\rüìñ Published 31st May 2020 | Read here.\n\rIn an unprecedented event, during Vekllei‚Äôs 50th Sea Festival since Independence in 2065, an 8 kiloton fission bomb was sunk to a depth of 150 meters and detonated at midday. It was an incredible sight on a day so clear you could see the gentle curve of the earth where it met the horizon. A flash of light and a spray dome surged outwards into the quiet Atlantic, which was broken apart by plumes that formed a column of water that climbed high into the sky. The lateral plumes, the ‚Äúmushroom‚Äù, reached far across the horizon, forming thick clouds that would begin to rain into the sea. From the coast, fifteen kilometres away, a warm light bathed observers and was followed a moment later by a bang that deeply shook you and those around you. In this instance it seemed that the whole universe was their domain.\nThe plume would rise nearly 1,500 metres into the sky before falling away. It stayed that way for a while. Almost nobody moved for a long time after ‚Äî people stood on cars and tables. You could only recognise the scale and the feeling of the fission bomb by seeing it in person. It seemed incomprehensible, in the face of such a device, that wars could still be fought at all. What use is a battleship in the face of a cloud like that?\n Tzipora and Elise, covering the detonation for Lola 7th School‚Äôs student newspaper, found themselves not quite sure what to say. Elise wrote, captioning Tziproa‚Äôs photograph, ‚ÄúThe Independence bomb filled our sky with our sea for a half-hour on Sunday, and with it rose the thoughts of every person in attendance, who considered the awesome power now shouldered by each of us.‚Äù\n There was indeed some sense that they had contributed to the bomb, and that they had more at their disposal. Few would fly the planes to deliver them, and fewer still had the brains to develop them, but participating in a nuclear century contributed to, in some effect, a nuclear horizon.\n Hot Rain in the Arctic Circle\r#\r\rüìñ Published 27th May 2020 | Read here.\n\rTzipora had been ejected from the operations room once the guys arrived. She knew what was going down, anyway. No specifics. But you didn‚Äôt bring in uniformed soldiers for regular business. National Intelligence liked to work with their own people.\nFive days prior, Baron hailed an EB/NI company car and it pulled up beside him. The electric passenger window slid down. Baron nodded at the passenger.\n‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs in here. There‚Äôs more if you need it. I‚Äôd appreciate a call, I‚Äôm in my office all next week, okay?‚Äù He passed over a white postage envelope. ‚ÄúTake care.‚Äù The British man opened the letter and read it twice as the car approached the Vekllei World Jetport.\n JULES WYNN IS YOUR 3RD MAN. ‚ÄúJEREMY‚Äù APPEARS IN ARCHIVES 2046 ‚Äî ALMOST CERTAINLY WYNN. NEARLY 20 YEARS. NOTES TO USSR THRU CYPHER CLERK (UNKNOWN). RECALLED TO MOSCOW ‚Äî GREAT SUSPICION OF HIM FROM CONTROLLER DOWSETT-CLARK (OXFORD). THIS IS GOOD INFO FROM PARIS ASSET. WYNN WILL DIE IN RUSSIA. GET HIM AND ANOTHER RING SURFACES. CIA KNOWS WHERE BUT NOT WHO. DO US BOTH A FAVOUR.\n Tzipora went for a walk to clear her head. She had a lot going on in her life ‚Äî though she was sure it seemed small compared to whatever was going on in the operations room. It began to rain an hour into the walk. She‚Äôd left her umbrella with the rest of her things in Baron\u0026rsquo;s office. That was okay. She didn‚Äôt mind the shower, anyway ‚Äî it was mid-summer, and the rain was warm. What a novelty that was, at 60 degrees north. This was weather from the sunny Azores, pulled north by the wind currents over the Atlantic. Within minutes her skirt was heavy and her camisole was showing at the shoulders. She blinked heavy streams of water out of her eyes. She passed the soldiers on their way out as she returned to AB/NI reception. A friendly receptionist had cloaked her in a towel by the time Baron had found her.\n ‚ÄúDid you have a good meeting?‚Äù She asked. ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù and characteristically, he considered that a satisfactory answer. He pulled the towel off her head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre completely soaked.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter. Are you with those guys? About that other guy?‚Äù ‚ÄúWatch it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúKeep that talk past security. But I‚Äôm going to fly out tomorrow. I‚Äôll be back in the evening.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo cooking for me, then. Where are you going? Or can‚Äôt you say?‚Äù ‚ÄúEngland.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Tzipora said, forming a gun with her fingers. ‚ÄúLike James Bond.‚Äù\n Her life was a nexus of various global ambitions, it seemed ‚Äî imagined only through the dreamy lens of a teen-ager too small for the world‚Äôs problems.\n The Last Train Out of Ada\r#\r\rüìñ Published 20th May 2020 | Read here.\n\rThey both watched as train 416 pulled away from the platform. And that was that ‚Äî there would be no school in the morning. That was how it worked in rural Vekllei, a million miles from the automatic trains on endless timetables. Out here, you paced life around the station.\nThere was not much to say about this, between the two of them. Tzipora looked at Cobian and pulled a froggy smile that tried to express that it was nobody‚Äôs fault. Sure ‚Äî it was Tzipora who had misplaced her purse, and it was also true that it was Tzipora who‚Äôd stopped by the orchard to steal a peach, but as to how they‚Äôd missed the train? It was simply impossible to say.\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a complete idiot,‚Äù Cobian said matter-of-factly, and Tzipora wilted. They watched 416 trundle into the sunset. A picturesque vision of rural utopia ‚Äî if only they were a part of it.\n Winter Uniforms in Vekllei\r#\r\rüìñ Published 16th May 2020 | Read here.\n\rWhen I paint Vekllei, I usually depict the warmer months. Hems are shorter, days are longer, and the destabilisation of the world‚Äôs climate has only benefited these arctic people. At the gift end of the Vekllei low pressure system, Scandinavian misery has become Mediterranean pleasure, with warm summers and a mild Autumn and Spring.\nStill, by late October, the the earth is hard with cold and the days are short. The world may be warmer, but Vekllei‚Äôs polar latitude is unchanged, and in the depths of winter the sun only rises for an hour a day. These are Vekllei‚Äôs ‚Äúmoon months‚Äù, and they announce some of the most important spiritual festivals in Upen.\n Although school hours are reduced in winter, life carries on and Vekllei fashion becomes traditionally utilitarian. Tzipora has poor circulation and cold hands even in the warm months, and by November she‚Äôs traded the skirt and gi for traditional rouisha trousers and a cloak. Rouisha, like a lot of traditional clothing, have origins in agriculture and are characterised by a loose, baggy fit and insulated lining. Cobian is wearing a heavy wool sack-type dress, which is worn like an apron over other clothing. Winter brings forth ‚Äúpetticoat society‚Äù literally. Note the leather plate on her shoulder, to which her christmas aiguillette is attached.\n In this sense, Winter‚Äôs revival of traditional clothing and customs further evidences its practice as the most traditional season of the year. Although the warm calendar flourishes with the futurist sympathies of a modernist Vekllei, not even the atomic age has been able to dispense with its hard-worked pragmatism developed in a millennia of bitter cold.\n 2031 Apartment Diagram\r#\r\rüìñ Published 15th May 2020 | Read here.\n\rBaron had inherited the apartment from his uncle, who passed in the year following his parents. It was in a mixed residential-industrial neighbourhood, adjacent to a canvas factory. Out back was a rivulet, which roared in the long rainstorms of early April.\n Each January, the Colour Bureau of the Architecture Assembly announces the year‚Äôs colours, and tradition in mainstream architecture and interior design is to incorporate the announced palettes, which usually contain a hundred or so colours. His uncle‚Äôs apartment had been built and furnished in 2031, and so it had a #2031 Colour Profile.\n In some ways, it was a very conventional apartment in the Vekllei tradition. It had a sauna and bath in the wetroom, a bidet, a sunken living room and a bread oven. In others, it was more peculiar. The apartment was bizarrely allocated across three levels. You alighted the entrance light well into a sunken living space, then climbed back up into the kitchen. The main living room and master bedroom were another step above the kitchen. Adjacent to the main living area was a closet and study, which overlooked the entrance from a half-meter mezzanine.\nIt was in this study that Tzipora set up shop when she arrived in March 2063. Baron had been reluctant to take her even provisionally, not least because it would mean searching for a new apartment in his busy return period after being abroad for ten years. Tzipora, however, had lived in a dormitory for much of her life and had settled in the alcove once she acquired a dresser screen. She refused outright the master bedroom, which sparked a sleepy agoraphobia. By the time Baron had made other accomodations, Tzipora had entrenched herself in the neighbourhood and had developed a severe sentimentality about the apartment and its rivulet, and so that was where he lived for the rest of his life.\nIn this sense, Tzipora had a strange kinship with the apartment. Baron sealed himself off in the master bedroom each night, but she never left the main living space. It was warm in there, especially in the flickering light of the enormous oven and fireplace, and when she moved the screen aside in the morning her little corner became part of the living area.\nShe had a lot of good memories of that apartment.\n Fiery Peaks\r#\r\rüìñ Published 7th May 2020 | Read here.\n\rAfter three days in Ada, Tzipora set off towards Mt Miya. She made good time, and after three hours had happened upon the shoulders of the bright Volouisnesnkull Glacier. It was about here that she heard a morbid industrial siren, echoing up the valleys from far away.\nAt first she thought it might have come from Ada, since Boya Chemical had a large plant there, but as she lay out her things for lunch she heard the distinct whine of a turbojet. It grew louder, and deeper, until a National Fire VTOL tanker roared across the sky, swirling powdered snow on nearby peaks as it arced across the glacier. It was close enough to catch the sun ablaze in the reflection of its glass nosecone.\nShe later learned that lava streams had opened up not far from where she‚Äôd hiked, and had been making their way towards a geothermal power plant nestled in the highlands. In the evening, on her way back, she saw a long line of fire supertankers and pumpers spraying water in beautiful arcs, where it caught hisses from bright streams of melted rock. It was a common enough sight in Vekllei ‚Äî hoses were the only defence you could reasonably make against the the fracturing earth.\nStill, it was not often you saw jets flying so low. It was funny to her that even the barren glaciers were tamed in this age.\n The Chemical Feast\r#\r\rüìñ Published 6th May 2020 | Read here.\n\rEast of Montre, West of Tjornes, waits a rare sight among Vekllei‚Äôs hard igneous slopes ‚Äî a crown of gentle sedimentary cliffs packed with ruddy sandstone, which melt glacially into the sea chasing blue-sky bergs.\nTzipora was, at the time, making her way on foot from Montre-Lola to Ada, which was a coastal town in the North-East known for its luxurious health spas. Tzipora was not much interested in health, but she was interested in walking, and she made a pilgrimage along the coast every few years to make sense of the world. She was going whichaway and destined for nowhere in particular. Tzipora was very much Baron‚Äôs daughter, in the end.\nShe had stopped to see the Red Cliffs forty kilometres out from Tjornes when she saw a cruiser of the constabulary parked unusually by the shore. The constabulary were not local police ‚Äî they were a national outfit tasked with policing government and ‚Äúbureau business‚Äù. You found them at power plants, outside universities, guarding the prime minister and providing bodies for HO/NI (Home Office at National Intelligence) when they needed doors kicked.\nTzipora was not the sort of girl to be intimidated by a badge, and she wandered innocently to the shore where she found the cruiser empty. She looked across a beach of black sand and saw some sort of operation playing out ‚Äî there was a gun boat not too far from the shore, and a police hydrofoil beached on the sand. She counted maybe a dozen officers. She wondered if they‚Äôd arrest her if she walked down to see what was happening. She climbed onto the hood of the cruiser to get a better look. Perhaps it was immigrants ‚Äî or smugglers.\nIt only took another moment to spot the smashed crates broken across the rocks before she knew what was going on. She was witnessing the dying days of the countercultural decade, and its chemical fuel was now smashed open before her.\n The 2070s were a wild time for the so-called ‚Äúpink years‚Äù in Vekllei, and for the first time in Tzipora‚Äôs memory she started seeing ‚Äúpleasure drugs‚Äù on the streets. There had always been plenty of sin carrying on in Vekllei, even in her early days ‚Äî hallucinogenics, alcohol, and synthesised highs were legal and easy. But you didn‚Äôt see much of the exotic stuff, which grew in a better climate. Hash, coke, H ‚Äî it was all underground stuff for personal use. These drugs were listed among many others in the class-A import prohibition orders, which made them hard to find and illegal to import. These were ‚Äúpleasure drugs‚Äù ‚Äî the Vekllei phrase for overseas narcotics that didn‚Äôt have a place in Upen or a preexisting cultural history. Comparatively, they were just ‚Äòfor pleasure‚Äô.\n  H for heroin was a big news item for a long time, and with it you had one the largest moral panics in modern Vekllei cultural memory. Crackdowns came soon after. Tzipora found it difficult to describe the feeling of the time. It was a new generation ‚Äî one she didn‚Äôt belong to, despite her appearance ‚Äî and she didn‚Äôt have much sympathy for hedonists. They might tell her different, but she never thought the pink years were about much more than feeling good all of the time. She wondered if she was growing old and grumpy inside.\n She wondered how the crates had got there. Had the coast guard sunk another smugger? You heard about the navy firing shots in the news sometimes.\nRuined with seawater and picked over by constables, the chemical feast of Vekllei‚Äôs pink years died with the times. Tzipora wouldn‚Äôt miss it.\nShe stepped off the hood and set off back towards the road, where a warm inn and hot food awaited her.\n The Trials of Cobian\r#\r\rüìñ Published 2nd May 2020 | Read here.\n\rAccording to her friends, Tzipora‚Äôs contemporary afflictions were tragic. Her medical problems; her violent childhood; her sensitivity and melancholy ‚Äî you could feel sorry for her, because a lot of her problems were not her fault. She invoked sympathy. Tzipora never considered herself particularly tragic. It seemed straightforward, if difficult; she continued to live ‚Äî and so she lived. Tzipora\u0026rsquo;s sympathy was instead reserved for her first and closest friend: Cobian.\nCobian was not well-liked at school, and it did not take long for Tzipora to find out why. She had a childish edge for a sixteen-year-old, and bitterly hated losing. She was not good at school or sports, was not particularly charming, and came across as desperately lonely. She was a quiet misandrist, which would have been fine if she could play the part of a self-assured social matriarch, but her mother‚Äôs despotic conservatism struck out that possibility early on. Such is life.\nAnd because her world was predicated on being liked and living a normal life, her psyche prohibited self-reflection. That was the great difference between Cobian and Tzipora. They may both have been young and neurotic, but Tzipora‚Äôs relentless self-interrogation left great space for personal growth. Cobian was instead trapped in a domestic play-fantasy, in which she could live out a mythical high-school life, and shattering that illusion would collapse her whole reason for being.\n Tzipora recalled visiting Cobian‚Äôs home for the first time. Cobian‚Äôs mother asked Tzipora to remove her shoes and socks and wash her feet before going to play inside. By the time Tzipora found Cobian in her room, the girl had already changed and handed over her uniform to be laundered. Tzipora, in her tomboyish indigence, had never encountered such a brutally hygienic regime.\n  Cobian was a different girl at home. Her anxiety and neurosis washed out a little, and her confidence was propped up by the routines her mother had set out for her since she was a child. There was a friendly, curious girl buried under a decade of loneliness.\n Tzipora wondered what Cobian thought about lying in bed at night, and why the girl worried so much about things that didn‚Äôt matter. And it was precisely in the smallness of those things and the tremendous anxiety Cobian owed toward them that made Tzipora want to hug her. To be so worked up over something so pathetic was startlingly moving. The idea that the girl had deluded herself into a corner of hopelessness seemed sad ‚Äî and the fact that no one would reasonably care about such a feeble, meaningless, self-inflicted state of affairs made it tragic.\nThrough Tzipora‚Äôs friendship and the world it opened up for her, some of Cobian‚Äôs edges were sanded down. Some of it was a late maturity ‚Äî some of it was Tzipora‚Äôs dismantling of the scaffolding the girl‚Äôs mother had shoved in there. With that effort, and obvious love, Cobian‚Äôs reason for being changed too. One day, in Tzipora‚Äôs presence, it didn‚Äôt seem so important to be liked by everybody anymore.\n V. The Book Club\r#\r\rA Cashless Tokyo\r#\r\rüìñ Published 28th December 2018\nClick here to read this essay standalone on this site\r\rüå∫ Note from the Editor\nThis essay was published on the original Vekllei site in February 2019. Since it will not be coming back, it is being reprinted here in a desperate attempt to fill out this issue. Yes, it‚Äôs painfully self-concerned and a little painful to read back, but for newcomers to the project you might find some ‚Äúobvious truths‚Äù about Vekllei you have not yet encountered.\r\r I did not come to Tokyo to find a reference for the Petticoat Project, because utopia does not exist there for me. In fact, by nearly every Vekllei metric, Tokyo is positively dystopian ‚Äî a consumer paradise of the crushing, isolating modernity Vekllei is supposed to escape. And yet, marks of this city (and this country) are prevalent through Vekllei as a constructed country and my aesthetic as a writer and an artist. I can‚Äôt bring myself to love all of Japanese society, but I do love the country and its people. This intersection between traditional utopian world-building (along the lines of News from Nowhere or even the original Utopia) and the emotional, linear fragments of utopian storytelling which realise the cold encyclopaedia of a utopian world were the focus of my expedition to Japan. The premise of Vekllei society is at odds with so much of Japanese society ‚Äî yet the emotional, aesthetic culture of the country (what I call the ‚Äòcharacter‚Äô of utopianism) has influenced my media creation tremendously.\nAs a supplementary preface, I would like to note that it would be terrible of me to dismiss Japan as an oriental wonder of salarymen and neo-Zaibatsu. That approach has more in common with Frank Capra‚Äôs wartime propaganda piece Know Your Enemy: Japan than it does with real structural criticism. It is all too easy to dismiss the social and economic conditions of the country today as the natural inclination of a Japanese caricature ‚Äî a homogenous hive-mind of enormously productive and obedient people. This is of course a terrible attack on the proud and long-standing tradition of dissent and progressiveness in the country ‚Äî which is also home to one of the world‚Äôs largest opposition communist parties. It is a country of student mobilisation, protests and intense factionalism between the left and right-wing radicals (Andrews, W., 2016). It is important not to conflate the impersonal structures of a society with the orientalist idea of cultural predisposition.\nA love of Studio Ghibli films and a desire for material and emotional escapism is what drives my utopian world-building. Where co-founder Isao Takahata had a penchant for artful emotional realism and domestic drama, Hayao Miyazaki has found tremendous success in Japan and abroad with his fantastical stories rich with nostalgia and warmth. They have obvious recurring themes ‚Äî childhood, environmentalism, aircraft, etc., but it is no real secret (at least to media critics and Ghibli superfans) that these overt recurrences are symptomatic of more serious and grounded beliefs. In a fantastic analysis of My Neighbour Totoro, Phillip E. Wegner makes use of Kojin Karatani‚Äôs works (another great influence of mine) to illustrate Miyazaki‚Äôs uniquely Japanese pre-Meiji cross-generational nostalgia evident in the film.\n What Miyazaki presents us with in My Neighbor Totoro is a vision in which the classic \u0026ldquo;what if\u0026rdquo; question of the genre has been proposed: that is, what if the Meiji revolution did not happen? Moreover, since it is the dramatic and rapid modernization of the Meiji period that gives rise to the virulent imperialist nationalism and militarism that ultimately results in the Second World War, Miyazaki also offers in his film us a glimpse of a Japan in which the catastrophe of World War II did not occur (Wegner, P.E., 2010).\n Japan‚Äôs spectre of modernity is a recurring character in many of Miyazaki‚Äôs films, just as the villain of war revives itself time and time again ‚Äî from the steel production of Iron Town in Princess Mononoke to the death of the golden age of aviation in The Wind Rises. Karatani‚Äôs landmark work, Origins of Japanese Literature, makes clear that basic premises of modern society ‚Äî from children to history to nature ‚Äî are not immutable items atomised by scientific fact, but instead products of modern society that have not always existed (Karatani, K., 1993. pp. 12-44, 113-135). Vekllei reflects this concept, at least superficially ‚Äî children are represented as independent agents desegregated from modern age-based schooling, nature is regarded as a fellow social organ, and work is largely self-satisfying and decommodified. These are things that are important to me and it makes sense enough that Vekllei reflects that.\nSimilarly, even supposedly less political Ghibli films like Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service carry powerful images of the ‚Äòspectre of modernity‚Äô. Regarding the climax of the film in which a zeppelin soars hopelessly out of control over a city, A.J. Rocca hauntingly writes:\n [We] find that this is not truly a witch‚Äôs story, but a ghost story. The ghost died in a fire on 6 May 1937, foreshadowing the fires of a war that would change the world forever. The ghost is called the Spirit of Freedom in the film, but its true name is LZ 129 Hindenburg, and it‚Äôs not the spirit of freedom but the ghost of modernity (Rocca, 2017).\n So the material manifestation of Japanese society for me‚Äî despite all the glory of her bright packaging and dense infrastructure ‚Äî is an aesthetic and satirical media culture that saturates the Petticoat Project. Vekllei is a \u0026lsquo;poor man‚Äôs Utopia\u0026rsquo;, inspired in part by my superficial understanding of a ‚Äòpoor man‚Äôs Japan'. Vekllei, like media representations of postwar Sh≈çwa Japan, has a shadow of pacifism and shame about it (that idea that \u0026lsquo;all politics is sexual pathology‚Äô occurs to me). These are deliberate aesthetic choices that reflect not landscape utopianism but character utopianism ‚Äî the real colour of a constructed world that acts out the structure of mean ideology and culture-constructs. These ill-defined images of utopian society, and a rejection of landscape world-building, are excellent vehicles for utopian writing. After all, it is sustained engagement with utopia that betrays the totality of it (Wegner, P.E., 1998). What fascinates me particularly about Miyazaki‚Äôs unique utopian instincts is his recurring premise is essentially nostalgic and escapist ‚Äî the aesthetic of a Miyazaki film is almost always midcentury or earlier, illustrating a time before Japan‚Äôs ‚Äòmodern century‚Äô. This is in stark contrast to the saccharine optimism of utopian socialists like Morris, Chernyshevsky, and Bellemy, telling stories of a future yet to come.\nAnd that is to say nothing of the aesthetic qualities of a Japanese city! Tokyo is a wonderful glimpse of a retro-future as imagined by the 1980s ‚Äî as though the economic crisis of the 1990s has since suspended time. Japan is clean and modern, but also retrofuturistic. The lifeblood of the city is in rebar and concrete as infrastructure. The people on the street are dressed in conservative items that go without the prudish connotations of similar Western fashion. Working men and women are suited traditionally, many with waistcoats. Such is the visual language of modern Japan. Young men sport tech-wear or innovative types of street-wear dominated by colour and comfort. General women‚Äôs fashion leans heavily on items popularly discarded in Western markets, at least until recently. Pleat or patterned skirts, blouses, cardigans, hosiery and socks, loafers and brogues, etc. are very common and provide a wonderful anecdotal rebuff to the outrageous images of ‚ÄòHarajuku girls‚Äô and Lolita style that epitomise some ideas of Japanese fashion. The famous ‚Äòsailor uniform‚Äô has been largely phased out of junior and senior high schooling, replaced with Western-style blazers and ties. Tokyo is not ‚Äòbehind‚Äô the rest of the world; that is not what it means to be retrofuturistic. In my eyes, it has disembarked from Western technological and fashion attitudes some time ago and has since progressed on its own collective cultural intuition, and has subsequently spent the last few decades exporting media, fashion and culture into the West. It‚Äôs a great thing to see in person, at the heart of it all.\nDespite my qualms with modern Japanese consumer society, Vekllei is perched on a romanticised and fictitious Japanese aesthetic, and the country is enormously influential on the way I go about world-construction. With one sentence I will denounce the complexity of Japanese honorific language systems and in the other fawn over the mixed agricultural-residential suburbs that make up so much of the land outside of Tokyo‚Äôs city limits. Koka parks were inspired by these displays of community food production. The Vekllei Constabulary were created after research and experience with the Japanese Police Box system. Vekllei‚Äôs knotted network of trains and streetcars are reminiscent of Tokyo and Hiroshima. For all my public rejection of modern consumer society, and my begrudging participation in it, the Japanese qualities of Vekllei are valuable and are utopian in their own right ‚Äî and so Tokyo remains one of the most important inspirations of Petticoat Society in the world.\nSo what of that dichotomy? Of deep ideological incongruities with Japanese consumer society, but an embarrassing affection for the mythological post-war aesthetic and Japanese culture? The truth of it is that Vekllei is first and foremost a collection of stories, and stories are the domain of the emotional. Wonderful, vague images of utopia ‚Äî like washing corn in My Neighbour Totoro or an all-night writing session in Whisper of the Heart. My time in Tokyo introduced me to a wealth of these nostalgic feelings ‚Äî of curiosity in a cauldron of social atomisation. Life in Tokyo is not without problems, and it is certainly not my perfect idea of utopia, but the intersection of the culture and promise of Japanese society, either in the past as alt-history or in the future as science fiction, has me coming back time and time again to better realise my own projects of utopia.\nWorks cited above:\nAndrews, W., 2016.

It was on this day that Tzipora and Cobian first introduced themselves to each other, after Cobian‚Äôs ill-fated sweet sixteenth birthday party. Cobian was so struck with affection towards Tzipora and her friendliness that she was invited to a sleepover the following weekend.\n III. Vekllei Fact of the Month\r#\r\rYou might be aware that puffins are Vekllei‚Äôs national bird ‚Äî but did you know that some people keep them as pets? In coastal fishing towns, puffins make good friends. They‚Äôre curious, unafraid birds that keep their ‚Äúpufflings\u0026quot; safe in burrows underground. Vekllei has the largest population of Atlantic Puffins in the world. They‚Äôre also rather tasty!\n IV. WordBook\r#\r\rFiousmanyiosn ‚Äî ‚Äúfriendly architecture‚Äù. This is a Newda term that describes architecture friendly to its surrounds. ‚ÄúFriendly,‚Äù here, means to integrate and socialise with a structure‚Äôs surrounds, by employing local materials and styles. It can also be ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù in its purpose ‚Äî to provide a foundational service to a community, something important to cultural fabric. In this sense, Fiousmanyiosn refers to both a materials principle and cultural architecture.\n V. The Bulletin\r#\r\rWhat is This Project?\r#\r\rüìñ Published 30th June 2020 | Read here.\n\rWhat is Vekllei?\nHi, I‚Äôm Hobart and I write and draw Vekllei at Studio MillMint.\nThis is a pretty complex project. Not just complex insofar as there‚Äôs a lot to read about it, but that it uses concepts and terminology you might not be familiar with if this is your first time around utopian fiction.\nSo Vekllei is a utopia ‚Äî what does this mean? It‚Äôs latin for ‚Äúno place,‚Äù and I use that literally. Vekllei, in a literal sense, cannot exist. Not because I think it could never have existed, or that some part of it is completely unreasonable, or it breaks the laws of physics ‚Äî but because it exists in a certain place and time that is just isn‚Äôt replicable. It‚Äôs all built from the ground up.\nVekllei is a very good place to live, but it is not perfect. Utopia does not mean ‚Äúperfect place‚Äù. Utopia is a form of social dreaming, much like worldbuilding, linked to the values and priorities of its author. In utopian studies, ‚Äúutopia‚Äù is usually broken down further:\n Eutopia ‚Äî ‚Äúgood place‚Äù Dystopia ‚Äî ‚Äúbad place‚Äù  Note that both form a part of the ‚Äúutopia‚Äù ‚Äî this is appropriate, since Vekllei is grounded in a social realism that acknowledges the good and bad parts of life. Indeed, they are inseparable ‚Äî you cannot have the light without the dark. Obviously, in my eyes, Vekllei is very much a eutopia. You can read more about Vekllei (the country) by clicking here.\nThere are three parts to my ‚Äúsocial dreaming‚Äù:\n Landscape ‚Äî the world and country of Vekllei. When you think of ‚Äúutopia,‚Äù this is it ‚Äî shining modernist cities against striking landscapes. Character ‚Äî not all social dreaming takes place in spaces. Some of it is built around experiences, objects and relationships. Tzipora is a ‚Äúcharacter utopia‚Äù in the sense that she represents a utopian life experience, full of stories good and bad. Author ‚Äî Vekllei is a representation of the problems of my life, as a form of escapism. A lot of my posts here reflect dissatisfactions and displacements in my own life ‚Äî consumer society, commodification of childhood, wage labour, postmodernism, etc. I‚Äôm very much a part of this utopian dialectic.  Let‚Äôs run through some of the common queries and misunderstandings about Vekllei\nWho are you? A Tasmanian illustrator.\nYou‚Äôre not Japanese? „ÅäÂâç„ÅØ„ÇÇ„ÅÜÊ≠ª„Çì„Åß„ÅÑ„Çã\nWhy is Vekllei a utopia? It makes me feel better about my life and the world. It‚Äôs escapism; it‚Äôs a dream.\nIt‚Äôs a bit cringe to grandstand your political beliefs, doncha think? Vekllei is a personal utopia. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm selling. At least you‚Äôre getting good opinions.\nWhere‚Äôs the tension if it‚Äôs perfect? Vekllei is very cynical and tragic in places. Utopia is just a reflection of the author, good and bad.\nIs there a novel? A story? A comic? I‚Äôm working on a comic right now. I‚Äôm pretty much working on Vekllei full-time so I‚Äôm hoping to announce it soon. I‚Äôve got a lot of different Vekllei projects going.\nWhere is Vekllei? Iceland.\nWhy does Vekllei look Japanese? Vekllei is like a country of Scandinavians speaking French with an Aussie accent in Sh≈çwa era Japan/Maoist China/Taiwan etc. Vekllei looks however I imagine utopia looks.\nHow does that make sense? Why can‚Äôt it just be cool?\nIs your alt-history thought out? Vekllei‚Äôs history is whatever I need it to be. I‚Äôm always trying to be realistic, but it‚Äôs all worked backwards from the setting. I‚Äôm not really ‚Äúworldbuilding‚Äù in a typical sense. Very little of it is published, most of it is retrieved on request. Just ask if you have questions.\nIs Vekllei communist? No.\nBut Vekllei calls itself ‚Äúpetticoat socialist‚Äù. Vekllei is set in a culture of Marxist revivalism in the 50s and 60s. A lot of Vekllei‚Äôs lexicon is set in that context. Vekllei is a decentralised democracy that doesn‚Äôt use money. It‚Äôs a sort of participatory economy.\nWhy the \u0026ldquo;petticoat\u0026rdquo;? Vekllei is a female country. Womanhood is decommodified. It\u0026rsquo;s maternal, social and friendly where socialist rhetoric is masculine, technocratic and progressive.\nWho is Zelda? Zelda is another name for Tzipora. She has two names specifically to confuse you.\nWhat is the ‚Äúbulletin‚Äù? I publish the Atlantic Bulletin once a month via email. It‚Äôs got the month‚Äôs posts in it as well as facts and tidbits from Vekllei. DM me an email if you want to join.\n Village Map of Montre-Lola\r#\r\rüìñ Published 29th June 2020 | Read here.\n\rThe village of Montre-Lola is home to about 400 people in its entirety, a stone‚Äôs throw from the Aisyo borough. Each morning, however, the population swells as 300 children from tiny villages in both Aisyo and Montre take a fast tram to the Montre-Lola Area School No. 2, a district school raising all ages of local youth.\nLike many Vekllei villages, Montre-Lola‚Äôs history is complex and has origin stories in both viking-inuit settlement as well as less sentimental government programmes that flourished after the atomic war. By historical accounts, Montre-Lola has been inhabited since at least 1500CE. By contemporaneous records, however, it was established as a village in land reform during the 1960s and revitalised by the building of the area school in 2057. Montre-Lola features many civic objects common to Vekllei villages ‚Äî a nondenominational place of worship (in this case, a historical Catholic church), a constabulary, a doctor, an auto/tractor pool, a general store, a station platform, and a village hall. A map of the village centre is dominated by the Area School, built in an Edunewda style, which features many new facilities that distinguish it from smaller, 20th-century schools. It‚Äôs a good place to grow up; where farmland and earnest modernity collide.\n Montre-Lola is most relevant as the residence of Tzipora Desmoisnes, the world‚Äôs oldest person and one of the first people to be diagnosed with Gregori-Heitzfeld Syndrome. She works as a librarian in both the Montre-Lola Area School and the Montre-Lola Library \u0026amp; Archives, spending most of her 12-hour workday in either of these institutions. She commutes via fast trams, which arrive automatically at the two platforms in Montre-Lola every half-hour and continue out into the surrounding farms. This means that, if she sets her watch right, she can step outside her front door and arrive at the school library in under ten minutes. This journey is marked in red on the map above.\n Dominated by farmland, Montre-Lola is communal and more traditionally ‚Äòanarchist‚Äô in flavour than Vekllei‚Äôs urban boroughs, which are obscured by convenience. As charming as it is suffocating, the community is very close-knit and made up of all sorts ‚Äî smart educated young men and women sent from Montre to teach, as well as farming families that have resided here for centuries. Life moves slower and people know each other. When the school hosts its cross-country race each year, nearly every person in the village is out to watch it. After all, it takes a village to raise a child.\n The Vekllei Crown: coins of a moneyless country\r#\r\rüìñ Published 24th June 2020 | Read here.\n\rVekllei, legendarily, does not use circulate currency. Goods and services are moved and offered arbitrarily, provided amply in abundance. Anything that is not abundant is manufactured and distributed directly under the control of a bureau, which is a trade organ responsible to the affairs of the country. At no point do coins or paper currency change hands in the day-to-day affairs of the country.\nIn this sense, Vekllei is usually described as ‚Äúmoneyless‚Äù ‚Äî yet it does in fact have a currency. The Vekllei Kroner, or ‚ÄúCrown,‚Äù is hundreds of years old, and Vekllei still operates a mint for currency. At any time, a Vekllei person can write to the National Mint and order a set of coins, like the ones pictured above. So what is going on here?\nAlthough the Kroner has not been used since 2022, after the last village in Stochi returned coinage to the Mint, it continues to exist to this day as a gold-backed currency in the International Market, through which Vekllei trades with other countries. The physical coins, produced mostly as a novelty in the tradition of mayaesdiou (medallions, or small metal pieces commonly collected and given in Vekllei), are a physical coinage of the International Market. The coins also operate as a form of bullion, or wealth reserve, since each coin is worth exactly its face value in gold. Since the International Market is completely closed and independent of the domestic economy, its value is controlled directly by the so-called Government Bank. It is one of the few gold-backed currencies in a developed nation today.\nTo further complicate things, there are actually two different Kroner in Vekllei. There is the Vekllei Kroner, which represents the International Market, but there is also a seperate Government/State Kroner, which is not minted and used only as an investment mechanism, backed by government \u0026ldquo;white bonds\u0026rdquo; which are usually measures of labour-hours or refined materials. It is, in a sense, a fiat currency alongside a gold-backed currency.\nThey exist independently because they are used for two seperate purposes. The Vekllei Kroner is used a wealth reserve and bullion, and also represents the collective wealth of the Vekllei people. Each citizen, in theory, is entitled to an equal share of the Government Bank, although it can only be withdrawn as currency in specific circumstances. Vekllei also holds substantial amounts of foreign currency in the Government Bank and Vekllei Kroner, which is used to invest and stabilise holdings and capital in foreign countries. The Government Kroner, on the other hand, is used as an investment mechanism abroad, usually in support of infrastructure. It is also used to acquire foreign currencies through investment in foreign capital.\nDespite having two currencies, neither the \u0026ldquo;Vekllei Crown\u0026rdquo; or the \u0026ldquo;Government Crown\u0026rdquo; are used in the domestic economy in Vekllei, which is autonomous and not subject to a central bank. So it is that Vekllei‚Äôs currency is both little more than a novelty and essential to the function of the country in a world still ruled by money.\n In the coinage depicted above ‚Äî 8 coins are minted in Vekllei today. They were designed in 2015, in the year of independence. They represent eight core values in the country.\n  The ‚Äúsmall crowns,‚Äù worth 1VK and 10VK respectively, represent fraternity and liberty, two founding elements of the Vekllei constitution. The 50VK coin is plated in silver and has a small ruby inset. Rubies are used to represent energy, in this case, the vitality of the spirits, which dominate Upen and the Vekllei landscape. The 100, 200, 500 and 1,000VK coins represent different landscapes of the country. As a volcanic island nation, the ocean (100) and landscape (200) coins are fairly straightforward. The humanity coin (500) represents the Vekllei people and ancestry ‚Äî note how humans are placed alongside other natural forces. The flower coin (1,000VK) represents the flowers of the country, which are important spiritually and have formed part of the Vekllei identity. Vekllei has the most flowers per capita in the world. The final, larger 10,000VK coin represents the previous seven together, as a total sum of Vekllei landscape and identity.\n To answer Tzipora‚Äôs question ‚Äî a bottle of fizzy drink cost about 2VK in the waning days of coinage in the early 2020s.\n A Map of Vekllei: 100 Boroughs; 100 Hearts\r#\r\rüìñ Published 14th June 2020 | Read here.\n\rMap Key\nRed: Magjet trains, 750km/h\rYellow: Bullet trains, 300-400km/h\rOrange: Regional trains, \u0026lt;150km/h\rBrown: Local trains, including limited express, \u0026lt;100km/h\rBlue: National highway\rDashed: Ferry line\rGreen: tarmacadamed airport\r The largest division of any portion of Vekllei land is the borough; a region of varying size and population with common culture, food dependency and economic interest. Anything larger than that is simply Vekllei ‚Äî they are ‚Äúone city‚Äù, after all, and consider themselves a city-state.\nThere have been exactly 100 boroughs since 2015. Each is named after the largest city in its region.\n The smallest borough is Bakur, in Afouismeh, with a population of 7,500 people. The largest is Vekllei proper, in the Capital Region, of 2.4 millions.  This transit map illustrates all 100 boroughs, Vekllei‚Äôs five tallest mountains, its permafrost glaciers and Tzipora‚Äôs home in Montre-Lola. Her five largest boroughs ‚Äî namely Vekllei, Lonne, Adouisneh, Montre and Copette, are highlighted.\nEven in this simple transit map we can see several truths about the country, like its population bias on the West Coast and the emptiness of the Lava volcanic region. You might recognise a few names there, like Lola in the West (Tzipora‚Äôs home with Baron) and Yana in Vekllei‚Äôs Ro Highlands (Ayn‚Äôs birthplace).\nTrains are clean, reliable, fast, efficient and safe. They are incorporated under Vekllei Rail, owned by the Transport Group Bureau. Using this map, designed for domestic tourists and foreigners, the adequacy of Vekllei‚Äôs rail transport is easy to plan around ‚Äî you can eat breakfast in a cafe in the seaside town of Mumen, and hike before midday on the glacial slopes of Askayoisn. Since there are no tickets or costs, there are no excuses for not visiting relatives in the country, now that transport is now a trivial inconvenience.\nEach borough is represented in Vekllei‚Äôs parliament by an elected representative. These representatives wield extraordinarily disproportionate power ‚Äî the representative for Callaisn, for example, represents hundreds of times more people than the representative for Tanger, but both have the same vote. This is because boroughs are not just representative of their populations, but also their environments, industry and other social organs otherwise unable to vote. It is important to keep in mind that Upen (and consequently, policy) recognises the landscape itself as the sovereign organ of the country, and so in this sense it has its own interests and projections.\nIn practice, representatives act in an advisory, nonpartisan role in government, voting rarely in an auxiliary role to the professionalised, elected legislature. Vekllei has a strictly constitutional parliament, and the economy largely prohibits interference. In this sense, the parliament is both partially undemocratic in its inefficiency and apolitical in its orientation as a sort of civil service bureau, managing state affairs and reacting to pressures and the long-term aims outlined in the 2015 constitution. In the Vekllei mindset, the ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù is more or less another bureau, no different or particularly more interesting than the Transport Group Bureau. The trains, at least, have a tangible impact on their daily lives.\nHow appropriate, then, that this transit map produced in the summer months of 2076 combines both monuments of society. It also offers a glimpse of a larger, documented country not necessarily revealed in piecemeal story posts.\n A Most Beautiful Woman\r#\r\rüìñ Published 12th June 2020 | Read here.\n\rWhen Tzipora first laid eyes on Ayn, hours after her arrival in the country, she thought, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the most beautiful woman I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äù\nIt wasn‚Äôt just her features or figure that captured Tzipora‚Äôs attention ‚Äî it was also her confident, inconspicuous movements and a quiet self-assuredness that seemed obvious in her gentle expression and posture. Tzipora was not quite sure how to describe it. Her beauty was very alive in the way she inhabited a space, as she walked into the hotel lounge to meet them. Maybe it was grace ‚Äî maybe it was a little girl-crush ‚Äî she didn‚Äôt know.\nAs Baron greeted her and they exchanged cheek kisses, it appeared to Tzipora that Ayn and Baron were old friends, and she was further assured in her respect for him ‚Äî that Baron could know such beautiful women seemed natural! Baron was capable of anything in Tzipora‚Äôs eyes, a figure of ultimate power ‚Äî it only made sense that he knew this woman!\nOf course, both Ayn and Baron were mortal, and Tzipora got to know them well during the helter-skelter weeks following her arrival in Vekllei. Baron might have rescued her, but it was Ayn who introduced her to Vekllei, as AB/NI called Baron into office for the first time in a decade. It was Ayn who took her clothes shopping and wrestled with Zelda‚Äôs obsessive-compulsive fabric requirements. It was Ayn who taught Tzipora her first Vekllei sentence. And in the end, it was Ayn who convinced Baron that he had to take responsibility for Tzipora.\nIt was only years later that Tzipora began to realise that Ayn and Baron were, in a sense, married to each other through their work. They worked closely (he as recent head of operations at AB/NI, she as a research analyst in American economics) and their friendship went back decades. She was his ‚Äúwork wife,‚Äù which was the closest Baron could ever get to that particular institution, and so her proximity and love towards Tzipora made her a mother.\nShe was a vision of everything Tzipora wanted for herself ‚Äî to be capable and respected; beautiful and unassuming; intelligent and productive. And once more, it was Ayn, in the end, who convinced Tzipora that she could these things for herself, regardless of her genetic disability. ‚ÄúGo out there,‚Äù is what she said, ‚Äúand trust in yourself.‚Äù\n The Oa-Class Battlecruiser\r#\r\rüìñ Published 6th June 2020 | Read here.\n\rVekllei‚Äôs defensive military posture has, in doctrine and arms development, limited its ability to meaningfully project power outside of the Atlantic. As an island nation with a large and multifaceted naval armada, the Oa-Class Battlecruiser is the heart of her armed forces, as the flagship of her fleets.\nWhere U.S. doctrine places carriers offensively in the structure of its ship-groups, the Vekllei Navy is considerably more Soviet in its employ of carriers as primarily defensive air-bases to exercise sovereignty over her far-flung territories and island possessions. Oa-class Battlecruisers are notable as hybrid carrier-battleships, and feature a diagonal jetway with capacity for carrier-type naval jets (almost indistinguishable in the illustration above) and a variety of VTOL aircraft, which are common by the 2050s.\nFirst built in the 2050s by the sprawling National Naval Arsenal (located on Vekllei‚Äôs Far East coast, close to the foundries that pour her iron), 12 Oa-Class Battlecruisers are in service in the 2070s. They carry heavy fission reactors built by bureau monopoly General Reactor, supplemented by a gas-turbine generator, as is standard on all Vekllei-built nuclear vessels. Her unusual serpentine funnel is characteristic of Vekllei‚Äôs navy, and is a distinguishing feature of their naval design language.\nHer hulking superstructure and massive 15-inch fore guns recall the capital battleships of yesteryear, but she is a thoroughly modern battlecruiser with contemporary armament and electrics for combat and fleet administration. Named after Vekllei‚Äôs National flower, these Battlecruisers are the third-largest vessels in the navy and are multifunctional by design, often operated as strategic and operational platforms to support Vekllei‚Äôs large defensive armadas that patrol the North Atlantic.\n She is armed with two triple-barrelled 15-inch shore guns that can be loaded with a variety of shells including nuclear payloads, silos for guided missiles, and specialised guns and missile platforms for anti-ship, submarine and satellite warfare. Her powerful communications array and sensors are positioned 80 meters above the surface for the benefit of radar and subsurface monitoring. She can also support up to 12 standard carrier jets at one time, or 16 individual helijets/VTOL craft.\n Vekllei has larger battlecruisers (the so-called super-battlecruisers match her height and are nearly twice her length) and much larger carriers, but the displacement of the vessel was never a priority. Vekllei‚Äôs naval architecture prioritises mobility and capability in their capital ships, and so the Oa-class vessels represent many intersecting vertices of Vekllei‚Äôs naval doctrine.\n Canal Living\r#\r\rüìñ Published 3rd June 2020 | Read here.\n\rAtlantic Salmon was the best in the world, and Vekllei had a lot of it. Ocean-going fishing boats brought their haul to Ro, where they cruised wide postwar canals and unloaded tonnes of shiny, bright salmon into processing plants. If a new factory was built, so too was a canal or a railroad. Nothing was trucked. Fish was traded fresh in markets or turned into emulsifiers and fertiliser.\nThe canals were worked heavily, and few fishing vessels were incorporated. The vast majority of Vekllei‚Äôs fishing fleet was owned by the people that worked them, trading with the Sea Office. From a quaisiosn or ‚Äúcanal park‚Äù you might see a dozen vessels in an hour. Some were run-down prewar things limping out to the shallow coasts, while others were nuclear-powered salmon trawlers designed for the storms of the Atlantic. On the northern coast, the bigger boats were reinforced as ice-breakers. Fish was one of the few meats in the Vekllei diet that wasn‚Äôt grown in an industrial laboratory, a fact reflected in the scale of its infrastructure.\nCanals are good for a city, and are good for the heart. Tzipora would take long walks in the morning along the Wellington Canal to where it met Touismah, then follow it to where it circled back into Lola. She would figure out what she was doing with her life as the boats departed for the day‚Äôs catch. She never much liked salmon, but she liked the boats. They were an island country, and their futures and pasts met in the sea ‚Äî where it churned and swelled in their dreams.\n VI. The Post Office\r#\r\rAussie Thoughts on Police Violence [NEW]\r#\r\rBY HANGDOG#4510\nIf you lived under a rock, you might be excused for missing the brutal murder of George Floyd. Unfortunately for you, America is the centre of all Earthly affairs, so the odds of the social media wildfire missing you are slim to none. But that‚Äôs okay, really, because at least it gives you something interesting to watch on the news, as a police station is torched or a wheelchair-bound hobo has his face blown open with a rubber bullet.\nCan we Australians say we are better than Americans? Absolutely. You‚Äôre 27 times more likely to be executed by a police officer in the States than you are here. Roughly 25% of the world‚Äôs prison population can be found in the ‚Äòland of the free‚Äô, and it seems every single protest has resulted in someone losing an eye or being knocked into tomorrow. But are we perfect? Fuck to the no. Earlier this month, videos surfaced of a police officer sweeping the legs of an Indigenous youth in retaliation for a few measly swears. Almost a third of our prison population are Aboriginal Australian, despite accounting for just over 3% of our general population. That sucks.\nWhat are our possible solutions? Currently the popular rhetoric is radical and reactionary, with #ACAB and #AbolishThePolice signaturing every ‚Äòwoke‚Äô Twitter or Instagram post. These reductionist slogans do hold merit; it‚Äôs not the individual that is evil, it‚Äôs the policing institution as a whole. Money that is spent inflating the budgets of corrupt police departments and outfitting riot squads with military-grade hardware could be better spent on community solutions. We need to elevate communities from the material poverty which leads to crime.\nThe question, then, is culture. Do we in the West have a social consciousness ready for community policing? Can we be sure that a decreased police presence will stop scenes like the Murray Hill Riots in Canada, where a police strike led to 16 hours of widespread looting? Can the West, and especially the Americans, really be trusted to govern themselves? This author thinks no. Excluding utopian socialist ideas that the root of all human evils is capitalism, tangible solutions are necessary.\nIt seems to be that the pragmatic approach is the strongest. Reforming police unions, holding officers accountable for crimes they commit on duty, and increase the standards necessary to wear the uniform and possess the badge. These sensible, attainable solutions would not only have immediate effects, but could have long term effects on American culture at large.\nReform however cannot perfectly address the root of the issue with the police. The police do and always will be the only entity to possess a ‚Äòlegitimate‚Äô monopoly on violence. There is no use boring you in an anarchist breakdown of the monopoly on violence and the danger of hierarchies, because some dead revolutionary from the last century has put it better in some dusty tome. Simply put, any hierarchical enforcement of law will always justify the use of violence. The key is examining culture and society, and deciding on meaningful compromise between an ideological ideal and a pragmatic policy. We can negotiate between what is and what ought, but no solution will be perfect. Laws are by their very nature imperfect and malleable, bound not to a higher authority but to a cultural identity. The aim is not utopia, but to possess something that is better than what we have today.\n Live to Ride: Harley-Davidson and the Commodification of Identity [NEW]\r#\r\rBY CHEVALIERMALFET#1904\n‚ÄúThe proof,‚Äù they say, ‚Äúis in the pudding.‚Äù\nIf you ask a motorcyclist about Harley Davidson, you‚Äôll get one of two answers. The people who don‚Äôt ride them scoff at them - heavy, dirty, clunky, and slow, Nixon-era dinosaurs inferior to both the Japanese standards and their own clones. If you ask a dedicated Harley rider, though, you get a different picture - they love their machines and their experiences riding them, and would never consider abandoning the company for a rival‚Äôs product. How has this company inspired such loyalty in spite of its terrible product?\nBefore I reach the point of this essay, fair is fair: Harley Davidson has an excellent customer service program and a wide network of dealers and mechanics. While this has nothing to do with the bikes themselves, it‚Äôs still a point in their favor.\nBut the main point is simple. A man who buys a Harley isn‚Äôt simply getting a new vehicle - he (and it is almost always he) is buying a new identity. Because of Harley‚Äôs tireless marketing, he has a very clear image of the sort of person who owns one. Every bike sold comes with a ticket to a new sense of self, and a new life as a ‚ÄúHarley Guy.‚Äù\nWho is the ‚ÄúHarley Guy?‚Äù Who does this new rider imagine he‚Äôll become? 60 years ago, the Harley image was bound up with real antisocial behavior. The first wave of bikers were WW2 veterans, shell-shock cases unable to return to civilian life, and their bikes were military surplus. Hunter S. Thomson‚Äôs Hell‚Äôs Angels describes the titular gang shooting heroin and smashing up gas stations.\nBut as the sixties wore on and the original bikers aged out or died off, Harley shifted its marketing. When its last domestic competitor went out of business, Harley wrapped itself in the flag and called itself the only choice for ‚ÄúReal Americans.‚Äù When Japan started selling small-displacement moped scooters, Harley touted its big bikes as the only choice for ‚ÄúReal Men.‚Äù When the automobile industry faced tighter safety regulations, Harley lobbied against helmet laws and called their buyers ‚ÄúReal Rebels.‚Äù\nCombine it together and a picture emerges: the ‚ÄúHarley Guy‚Äù may be out of step with square society, but he‚Äôs still a member of it - and its enemies are still his enemies. He might rebel against the rat race and the nanny state - especially when they want him to wear a helmet - but that‚Äôs because he‚Äôs channeling the purest essence of America, the cowboy spirit of an imaginary past. He salutes the troops and supports the police, and he always stands up for the national anthem. Most of all, he is a member of a group - the Harley brotherhood, a community of like-minded individuals.\nFor most of the 80s, the American government protected Harley-Davidson with crushing tariffs. But those tariffs expired in 1988, and Harley was forced to fight the Japanese on even terms. Fighting bike-to-bike was impossible; the four Japanese OEMs were lean, mean, and honed to razors after 40 years of competition. Instead, Harley tripled-down on the marketing. The dealerships are apparel-shops, where customers can buy logo-branded shirts, bags, shot-glasses, and travel checkers sets. It has never been easier to show your identity - and your membership in the corporate family.\nMost advertisers sell their product by selling the image of the person who owns it, but Harley-Davidson must be the most infamous, and obvious, example.\n VII.

This is the month of postcards, and feeling tired. There are fewer posts this month ‚Äî and aside from Vekllei‚Äôs Race for Inefficiency, they‚Äôve all been pretty tepid stuff. There‚Äôs good reason for that, and hopefully we‚Äôll be back to regular production next month. And the postcards are currently making their way around the world ‚Äî how exciting!\nWhere do we go from here? Am I just going to continue grinding out posts for the rest of this year? Well, possibly. But the theme of the last few editions, and of which July is no exception, is the ‚Äúfuture‚Äù of this project ‚Äî preparing to finally make Vekllei something ‚Äúreal\u0026quot;. Worldbuilding is fine ‚Äî but storytelling is a great human talent, and I would like to tell stories in Vekllei. I‚Äôm a bit boxed in, at times ‚Äî distracted by nice things like postcards and university study, as well as regular posts and sketches ‚Äî but I want to start something big. I want to start a comic.\nExpect news next month.\nIn the meantime, the global pandemic has subsumed all of us into the surreal, and a lot of us lucky enough to be unaffected by Coronavirus are simply floating around, grasping for meaning and purpose in a world that seems as though a cosmic bit flipped somewhere after 2001. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one who, months into lockdown, is starting to find the abyss staring back at me. I think the way out of it is to draw more.\nThanks for reading, and I\u0026rsquo;d also like to thank the contributor to this edition, Mtirado, for their essay. If you would like to contribute to The Atlantic with writing, art or reviews relevant to the spirit of petticoat ideology, please contact Hobart at melonkony@icloud.com before the 31st of August.\nThank you for supporting Vekllei, and best wishes.\nHobart Phillips Enjoy ‚Äî Ê•Ω„Åó„Çì„Åß\n I. News \u0026amp; Announcements\r#\r\r Postcards have been sent! Finally ‚Äî this was a mammoth task. Six illustrations back-to-back doesn‚Äôt sound like much, but I‚Äôm no good at doing the same thing over and over. Shipping may take up to four weeks because of the coronavirus pandemic, so hopefully everyone will have theirs by August. Let me know if you don‚Äôt. I have purchased some nice watercolour brushes for my digital workflow, and so you‚Äôll see some rough edges in my work for a while as I learn how to use them. Absolutely no work has been done on the website. It‚Äôs a shame, but it‚Äôs a matter of time. It was always going to be a long-term, big-payoff project and when it‚Äôs done, it‚Äôll be spectacular. Hopefully August treats it better. www.millmint.net and www.vekllei.com now redirect to www.millmint.studio! Makes it a bit easier to share.   II. Tzipora-watch\r#\r\rIt was in July that Tzipora first met Ayn‚Äôs parents, who would quickly assume a role in Tzipora‚Äôs life as her own grandparents. Ayn‚Äôs mother, Ana, is Soviet-Born, and her father, Tony, is a Hong-Konger. Despite her international heritage, Ayn is afraid of both the sea and the sky and has never left Vekllei‚Äôs shores. Tzipora looks forward to spending part of the summer in Yana with Ayn and her grandparents each year.\n III. Vekllei Fact of the Month\r#\r\rVekllei‚Äôs heavy diet of lab-grown meat, called ‚Äòfactory steak‚Äô or eoui demanufacturie is so widespread in cities that many children in the capital region have never eaten meat from a living creature. Its texture and taste, especially after processing, is identical to beef and comes in different forms to replicate different cuts of meat, including fat and gristle. Most ‚Äòreal‚Äô meat in Vekllei cities consists of sweetbreads, offcuts and organs ‚Äî the stuff left over from authentic rural consumption of the prime cuts. Chicken hearts, for example, are eaten by themselves or on a skewer.\n IV. WordBook\r#\r\rIyadaisnesn ‚Äî also called ‚ÄúInsta-skin‚Äù is a collagen scaffold that rapidly seals and then regenerates skin over wounds. It is used medicinally in Vekllei, where it is branded as Iyadaisnesn, and is usually aerosolised and applied to shallow scrapes and grazes to seal the wound and prevent infection. Within a few days, it‚Äôs good as new! A type of Insta-skin is also used by the military, where it is distributed in wet pouches and acts much faster on much more serious wounds.\n V. The Bulletin\r#\r\rMeet Tzipora \u0026ndash; concept panel for a Vekllei comic\r#\r\rüìñ Published 31st July 2020 | Read here.\n\rThere are a lot of things Tzipora does differently to everybody else, and they start to make a lot more sense when you realise Tzipora either does not realise she is unusual, or does not care.\nShe has a lot of endearing characteristics that give great character to her mannerisms and physicality. She has a small overbite that makes her look a little froggy, and ritually pulls on her shirt and wipes her nose in anxious conversation. She is round-headed and cuts her hair herself. She talks in a low, expressive voice. She has been poorly socialised in childhood, and is afraid of casual conversation with people she does not know. She is keenly socially attuned and feels awkwardness painfully.\nShe wears the same clothes two or three days in a row. The outfits themselves are variations of the same thing, and her tastes don‚Äôt change. Everything hangs off her ‚Äî she likes baggy, airy clothing, and upsizes to accomodate. She doesn‚Äôt like fashionable or voguish people, whom she regards as decadent and offensive. To Tzipora, taste is timeless and bound to the soul. In her case, this fact has held true ‚Äî she has dressed the same as childhood, and very little else has changed about her in that time.\nShe is paranoid and conservative, good-natured and austere, with a moral outlook bound by her deepest anxieties and obsessions. She is deeply spiritual and material, fascinated with objects and their history. She has many collections of many things she‚Äôs found. She‚Äôll likely die a Catholic, but has a confrontational relationship with God and no longer attends mass, as a declaration of humanism. She does not know if this has pissed Him off, but it‚Äôs working out so far. Maybe that‚Äôs why He made her a homosexual ‚Äî to get back at her. He must have a good sense of humour, if that‚Äôs the case.\nTzipora may be intense and inward-facing, but she can also be disarmingly charming and self-deprecating. She has a good sense of humour. There are not many girls that can so easily reconcile the contradictions between the peculiar and the healthy, the eccentric and the friendly, and the violent and the domestic. That‚Äôs part of her character ‚Äî an essence of being that radiates decency, good taste and a respect for the spirit of all things.\n Summer House in the Azores\r#\r\rüìñ Published 28th July 2020 | Read here.\n\rThe Azores had been a possession of Vekllei since 2002, when they were leased from Portugal indefinitely. The lease was defunct by the time of Vekllei‚Äôs independence from U.K. occupation in 2015, and the new state took formal ownership over the small Atlantic islands.\nThe Azores was Vekllei‚Äôs resort region, often called simply the ‚Äúholiday isles‚Äù. Brief reprieves from the North Atlantic cold were granted to hundreds of thousands domestic tourists each year in resorts and holiday rentals alike. Tzipora spent the summer of 2079 there. Good memories were made in that summer. She did not much like the beach but she liked the ocean. If she could retire, it would be in the Azore\n Base Camp\r#\r\rüìñ Published 21st July 2020 | Read here.\n\rJust a paint-sketch.\nThe puffin scouts set up camp not far from the rest, just outside of Krafla in the Lava region. When they moved south tomorrow, thick native grasses and trees would give way to flower-tundras and bare hills, and by Tuesday they‚Äôd be in the heart of Lava ‚Äî empty and extraterrestrial and volcanic.\nThe Krafla high-energy communications tower was visible from all over the region. It provided uninterrupted radio to most of North Lava, and could relay signals through satellites. In another country, it might have been considered a blight on a pristine view ‚Äî but in Vekllei, there was no such thing as pristine. It was as much a part of the landscape as the trees.\nThey started the fire first, figuring they‚Äôd have more enthusiasm for the tent when they were warm. Warm sunrays played on the field-grasses around them.\n Tzipora‚Äôs ‚ÄòEvery Day Carry‚Äô\r#\r\rüìñ Published 20th July 2020 | Read here.\n\rLike a lot of girls of poverty, Tzipora was very possessive of her things. No food was ever left on her plate. There was a deep anxiety that whatever wasn‚Äôt claimed would be lost. She was also naturally obsessive and material-oriented, keenly aware of the importance of objects measured by metrics in her own silly head. You can discover a lot about a person from their trinkets and toys ‚Äî let‚Äôs discover a bit about Tzipora.\n  Her handbag is manufactured by Spaa S.p.A., a design firm in the capital. They‚Äôre a luxury item in the international market but readily available in Vekllei, since few other handbag makers operate on the scale of Spaa. Ayn picked it out shortly after Tzipora‚Äôs arrival for its colour, after Tzipora told her she did not own any red things.\n  Tzipora has a sweet tooth. Especially for soda, which she calls ‚Äúfizzy drink‚Äù. On her person at any time, she carries a flavoured beverage from one of several brands capable of meeting her discerning tastes. She supplements them with a water bottle, since not even fizzy drink refreshes as well as water after phys-ed or a hot day. She also stocks her arsenal of snacks with good fruit picked off trees that overhang footpaths, as well as devastating salvos of Vekllei‚Äôs finest confectionary, including Fruit Tingles and chocolate pearls. Other girls in her class bemoan her childish metabolism as she drinks soda for lunch while they watch the scales.\n  The nostalgic whimsy of the sweets is tempered by two or three loose cigarettes that float around in her purse at any given time. She‚Äôs not a regular smoker, but she‚Äôs prone to attacks related to stress, and nothing helps as much as a drag. She carries matches, for not much reason other than that‚Äôs what Baron uses, and Tzipora is notoriously sentimental.\n  Tzipora has a rock collection that sits on her bedroom sill, and her recent additions sit at the bottom of her purse. She‚Äôs not a rock elitist; quartz from footpaths catches her attention as easily as igneous treasures like palagonite. Her favourite is obsidian.\n  She carries a small collection of useful books, including a contemporary paperback and a notebook. The paperback is for recess and lunch; the notebook is for language notes and phone numbers. Her Vekllei I.D. papers, which are both a passport and a reference booklet of key information and services, are carried on her at all times. It‚Äôs not really necessary in day-to-day life ‚Äî but who knows when it might be, and Tzipora won‚Äôt be the one patting her pockets at the airport gate.\n  Finally, there are a few accessories sitting in the bag. Tzipora made a ring for Cobian in metalworking class, but Cobian is on a school trip to France at the moment and Tzipora is waiting for her return. She has a wristwatch given to her by Baron, which she wears sometimes depending on the occasion. Other items are more precautionary ‚Äî a scarf for the wind, a handkerchief for sneezing, and a spare pair of socks for when she visits Cobian‚Äôs house or if she needs to double up in cold weather. As summer turns to autumn, she also carries gloves and a beanie.\n  With everything in its place, her handbag is her anchor in the world outside her small second-floor apartment. The decommodification of society has only intensified the social value of objects, and they remain as important as ever in the life of the ordinary Vekllei person.\n The Race for Inefficiency: Vekllei‚Äôs advocation of austerity, apathy, and playfulness as economic principles\r#\r\rüìñ Published 13th July 2020 | Read here.\n\rOverview of the Bureau System\r#\r\rThere are many thousands of companies busy with work in Vekllei. The vast majority of these companies are single-person shops (S.p.A., or senrouiva pettetie anaproiouya). Also common are wobbly shops, or co-operative businesses (S.q.A., or senrouiva qualitie anaproiouya). The largest of the non-bureau companies are village factories (S.p.M., or senrouiva persimonaya manufacturie).\nThe bureau-level world is full of company mastheads that emphasise modernity, dynamism and progress. Vekllei‚Äôs ‚Äúprivate businesses‚Äù, however, tend to be local in taste. The vast majority of S.p.A. and S.q.A. businesses bear the family names of their founders ‚Äî Desmesyo S.p.A., Risyiouisnesn Home Machines S.q.A., etc. Their legal denominations are almost always affixed to the end of their nameplates.\nTheir senrouiva designation marks them as non-bureau businesses. A bureau, as a reminder, is simply the top-level organisation of a trade union that organises business in the country. In practice, it means that a company is responsible to the political organs of the country. Although independent from the government, bureau business is inextricably entwined in government concern and runs parallel to it.\nSenrouvia businesses are also part of the bureau structure, but are in practice not managed directly by them. They are usually united in local concern by so-called petty bureaus; small cooperative organs that safeguard local interest and business. These petty bureaus are often at odds with the bureau organs proper, and so even though they are part of the same structure, they are fundamentally political opposed.\nSo what is sort of business goes on in a bureau proper?\nThere are two common categories of so-called ‚Äúbureau firms‚Äù. You have state industries (S.A., or societie indastrie), which deal with manufacturing and exploitation of resources that require direct management by a public organ. You‚Äôll already be familiar with several ‚Äî General Reactor S.A., Comen Aeroyards S.A., Farmer‚Äôs Syndicate S.A. to name a few.\nYou also have state requisites (A.r., or requoisesiasn amourisocietie), which refer to the vast government-operated organs made up six categories primarily.\n Utilities (A.r.Un.) Transport (A.r.R.) Education (A.r.E.) Local healthcare (A.r.F.) Construction (A.r.Lo.) Automation (A.r.M.)  Yes ‚Äî education is not organised as a government department, but a bureau business. Other state responsibilities are folded directly into government departments ‚Äî war, intelligence, healthcare, police, fire, and the mint are all managed directly by the government.\nArgument\r#\r\rWith the legal division of enterprise laid out, let us examine again the four precepts of the Vekllei economic ideology.\n Self-management and self-interest through Sundress Municipalism. Classification of property as an independent social organ, like nature. Abolishment of currency and currency-substitutes. Participatory employment. Economic feminisation.  These four principles reveal a great deal about the character of the country, and stand largely at face value. There is an interest in chasing the promises of modernity while deconstructing its metaphysical constructions, through the abolishment of exchange-value, property and the overhaul of gender-economics. There are anarchist gestures in each principle, yet it is obvious that the product of these values complexify the conventional anarchist imagination. This is part of a series of contradictions ‚Äî between free and planned markets, between internationalism and provinciality, between man and woman, between freedom and security.\nAusterity\r#\r\rThe bureau system is plagued by inefficiencies, arising from logistic systems premised on warehousing, poor Coasean bargaining between petty bureaus and proper bureaus, a political emphasis on macroeconomic outcomes, a decoupling of aggregate demand and national economic output, cultural intolerance for Pareto inefficiencies, etc.\nLuxury goods often vary in both supply and access, and economies are often severely localised to the point of provincialism, meaning that Vekllei has failed to transition reliably to a modern consumer society. The inhabitants of the Montre borough most often eat seafood because speciality meats, especially authentic red meat, are scarce. The opposite is true in Yana. Clothes are repaired and regifted, appliances are available only from regional outlets usually located in the same city as the factory, and culture and diet are fiercely regional.\nThis is, in part, a result of unflinching national austerity and the sublimation of artificial markets prompted by Vekllei‚Äôs gold-based auxiliary currency, which necessitates meeting debt obligations for its strength internationally. There is a belief in Vekllei that the wealth of the country allowed the abolition of the currency ‚Äî in fact, the opposite is true. The abolition of currency allows a permanent wealth that compensates for the inefficiencies of the bureau system. The bureau firms do not pay their workers ‚Äî on paper, there are no expenses for anything beyond raw commodity exchange. This is how Vekllei‚Äôs largest companies ‚Äî and, per the bureau system, its government ‚Äî remain solvent.\nAusterity is a cultural force, too ‚Äî the scarcity of luxury goods inflates their social value, where comforts and necessities are largely abundant in automation. It creates an unimportant hardship that keeps Vekllei people forward-facing, lean, and ambitious. To acquire Picco S.p.A.‚Äôs iconic lounge chairs, you have to travel to their outlet in Horn, hundreds of kilometres from the capital area. There is no motivation for a craftsman to meet demand ‚Äî there is no petty consumption, either. To own a Picco chair means you have understood its cultural value, utility and craftsmanship, and have made the effort to find and transport one to your home. Inconvenience, and by extension, austerity, is celebrated as a ‚Äútrial of ownership.‚Äù Objects are very important in Vekllei, and craftsmanship is highly valued, and so people like to surround themselves with hand-made, sublime things wrought not just by the labour of the artisan, but their own effort to acquire it.\nPetty austerity instills a national sentiment that tells the ordinary Vekllei person they are hardier than the ordinary American or European, even if the wealth of the ordinary Vekllei person is much greater than that of the ordinary American or European.\nApathy\r#\r\rDespite a vast, loosely organised private market in the senrouiva categorisation, Vekllei does not reward entrepreneurial ambition. Ambitious people are funnelled into positions of power in bureau firms and political office, but the founding of S.p.As and S.q.As is rarely motivated by a desire for influence or power. Indeed, artisanal S.p.As are often incapable of the sort of economies of scale needed for expansion. Vekllei instead relies on a sort of economic apathy, in which aggregate demand and productivity are spurned for immediate interest and pleasure.\nThis ensures that\n luxury products remain creative, personal works per Upen‚Äôs insistence on the symbiosis of labour and product the private senrouiva market is not capable of threatening the provincialism of Sundress Municipalism, which might make a commodity universally accessible and threaten to introduce generic consumer society into Vekllei life the private senrouiva market under petty bureau organisation does not threaten the organised de facto monopolies of the bureau companies  If Vekllei has replaced the commodity with the object, then it is through economic apathy that they have ensured objects will never again become commodities. Just as the ordinary Vekllei person is apolitical, so too are they apathetic towards change in their purchasing habits, favouring small, inconvenient and personal brands over those exploiting aggregate demand. In a sense, this also contributed to the popular Vekllei term product atheism, in which the metaphysics of products are dismantled and rearranged into social forms.\nIn this sense, the apathy is found on both ends ‚Äî within the senrouiva business owner, who is provided little upward mobility to satisfy ambition beyond local and regional expansion, and within the consumer, who recognises products only within cultural and social dimensions. Neither is conducive to a functioning, fair market on an interregional scale.\nPlay\r#\r\rPlay is the foundational motivation of most work in Vekllei. There are existential motivators, too ‚Äî a desire to wield power, or professional legacy ‚Äî but in many professions it is play by which a Vekllei person justifies labour. It is also why work is fiercely protected by petty bureaus and other labour organisations ‚Äî work is their connection to wider society, and that connection is held sacred in Upen.\nIt is through work as play that Vekllei is able to justify the employment of children. Financial motivations for work have all but disappeared ‚Äî in its place, the workplace has to convince people to work. There are few state protections for businesses unable to maintain a workforce, either ‚Äî it is one of the most common reasons for the shuttering of a company. The boss must convince his workers to stay, and so a total inversion of power has occurred.\nIn place of money, there is prestige, and in prestige there is myth. Few people have genuine interest in Fordism. Many more are attracted to the hand-crafted furniture of Picco S.p.A., and becoming recognised as a builder of great things. In a sense, a person ‚Äúacts out‚Äù the role of a craftsman, in the same way a person ‚Äúacts out‚Äù the role of a police officer, or ‚Äúacts out‚Äù life as a pilot.\nIn this system, the childish spirit of recreation, duty and ‚Äúthe adult world‚Äù is acted out by millions of Vekllei people each day. Seeds planted by a child play-acting as a farmer continue to grow, and so too does the Vekllei economy feed its population through the intersection of fantasy and labour. At this point it is obvious that play is not fantasy at all, but in fact a motivation for labour as genuine as profit. Where it falls short, in hard, disempowering jobs, it is automated and conscripted through the mandatory service system. As it is often described:\n‚ÄúThe Bureau System is labour-intensive where wanted, alleviated by industrial machinery where preferred, and automated where necessary.‚Äù\nIn its wake are states of play, and through play comes a decent framework for living, obvious in the basic satisfaction of the Vekllei people.\n Police in Vekllei\r#\r\rüìñ Published 8th July 2020 | Read here.\n\rThere are two regular police organs in Vekllei.\n Fedecenoayan porits (national police, or venopor) Comoisniyan denporitsa (local police, or cosmopor)  A young venopor officer stands on the left, in the full street regalia they‚Äôre renowned for. Unlike cosmopor they often carry machine guns while on patrol and are stationed outside of government buildings, hospitals, train stations, ports, schools and any company managed directly by a bureau, which is a trade organ of national importance. They are special units of special purpose, and supplement the deficiencies of local policing through their training and tactical deployment.\nThey are police insofar as they protect and respond to their community, including through special tactics situations, but are paramilitary in their wider function as a defence force for critical infrastructure. This is reflected in their history, traced cleanly back past independence and the Atomic War to the royal guards and junta federal police of old society, which continue to be reflected in their uniforms and several other ceremonial artefacts, like swords and knee boots. Venopor is a complex organisation with many different purposes. There are street patrols, pictured here, but there are also intelligence units associated with HO/NI and by extension the military, as well as tactical response teams, bomb squads, search and rescue and most other specialised emergency units outside of the capabilities of any given local police station.\nThis is contrast to the cosmopor, a more conventional police outfit. A cosmopor officer stands on the right, in standard summer uniform. He carries a radio, revolver and rubber baton for the worst of his duties, and is embedded deep into his local community. Cosmopor officers traditionally visit and introduce themselves to each house in their beat, and spend far more of their time mediating, counselling and organising than they do making arrests. The autonomy of most Vekllei communities largely spurns petty legal proceedings, and so the cosmopor are a critical aspect of sundress municipalism, resolving disputes personally and taking custody of a person only when it‚Äôs needed. Most crime in Vekllei tends to be emotionally motivated ‚Äî so it is in this domain that cosmopor navigate.\nThis makes the cosmopor especially powerful figures in a Vekllei village or township, but their duties are closely watched. While the Vekllei village may be autonomous, all officers in Vekllei are responsible to a division of venopor called ‚Äúofficer welfare,‚Äù or picosec, which operates autonomously to seek out incompetent or misbehaving police officers, no matter their jurisdiction or status. Where most business in Vekllei has very little in the way of professional behaviour or ‚Äúwork culture‚Äù, policing in Vekllei is held to high standards, and they are severely bound by traditions that have become codified as the country has grown. This is a time and place where the children of police often inherit the jobs of their parents, and the constables of a village often have roots that go back centuries. This often makes cosmopor very respected figures, and their successors and recruits are expected to work for that respect.\nIn a country that has done away with money as a measure of success, professional legacy is profoundly important in Vekllei. In this inversion of priority, teachers, doctors, pilots, constables and librarians are celebrated. This is not founded in a general egalitarianism, but in fact the precise opposite ‚Äî a celebration of success and influence, touching the lives of those around them. The glamour, and paycheque, has largely been stripped away. Only the work remains, and so that work has become more important than ever.\n VI. The Post Office\r#\r\rWhy you should love your computer: Independence and control through free software [NEW]\r#\r\rBY MTIRADO#2460\nDo you feel proud when you turn on your computer? Do you feel satisfied with your favourite software\u0026rsquo;s user experience? Nowadays technology, specially I.T., is getting more and more intertwined with our daily lives. Each year we rely more and more on it and at the same time, layers upon layers of abstraction are being placed to simplify its usage and impede our understanding of its inner workings. Social media, web services, software and devices that we use daily offer us an intuitive and simple experience at the cost of giving up any sort of control or fine-tuning. Take a look at computers for example ‚Äî your average desktop or laptop. For many people, their computer is just another tool; a complicated, scary, cumbersome tool. Plagued with viruses, weird pop-ups, and painful slowness. If you dare to turn on your slow, noisy computer, it\u0026rsquo;s because you had to print some documents or fill out an online form. So you just open MS Office Word, and/or Google Chrome, and forget everything else, because clicking on any other icon will render your computer useless. Even if it\u0026rsquo;s fast and sleek, computers are still a mystery. Then, outside of our comfort zone, there lies the stuff of tech specialists, hackers, and hobbyists. Even if you\u0026rsquo;re a tech enthusiast that keeps up with the latest gadgets and updates, your user experience is still dependent on the decisions of a single organisation or company that does not usually tolerate decentralisation. We do not have enough control over the products we own.\nWere computers always meant to be used like this? Like a black box that\u0026rsquo;s hard to open and understand ‚Äî hard to make it ours? Mainstream operating systems and software give us the promise of an experience that just works ‚Äî if we go all in on their ecosystems. Their software and utilities are easy to use and intuitive, but hard to understand and control. If you want to customize how your favorite program renders a different type of file, good luck with that. If you want to do something that\u0026rsquo;s slightly outside the program\u0026rsquo;s intended purpose, no one can help you. Future updates are controlled by a small, concentrated group. You can never know what goes on under the hood if you can\u0026rsquo;t open the hood. You can never know how something works if there\u0026rsquo;s no need to read the manual. These days, privacy concerns are greater than ever, and smartphones are getting harder and harder to tamper with, using proprietary software and assembly techniques that make repair difficult. We learn to accept and embrace the software that comes bundled with our computer and we shudder when we realise we need to fix a problem ourselves.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the alternative?, How are we supposed to strengthen the relationship between the user and the tool when we are told to accept that computers are hard to understand and control, and that abstraction is necessary? This is where free (‚Äòfree' as in ‚Äòfreedom'), open source software becomes relevant. Open source software gives the user privacy, flexibility, control, and choice. A wide variety of open source software caters to the nerdiest of power users and the casual users that only needs to browse the web and print some documents alike. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if you don\u0026rsquo;t know how to read the code. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to learn a programming language to be able to regain independence and control of your computer. Free software like Linux has come a long way, and is now more user friendly than ever. You shouldn‚Äôt have to choose between ease-of-use and open source software ‚Äî and with Linux, it‚Äôs no longer a trade-off. Installing a new OS, tinkering with your machine, following tutorials to customise the UI, and making a website not only gives you have a deeper understanding of how your computer and technology works, it helps change your perception of computing and your relationship with technology in general. Using software that encourages you to modify and customise gives you control and independence that no proprietary software can.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t promise you that you won‚Äôt face problems using open source software, because that\u0026rsquo;s simply not true. Sometimes we can\u0026rsquo;t leave proprietary software altogether. No software is perfect, just as no tool is perfect. But at least free software gives you the opportunity to make a better tool, if you\u0026rsquo;re willing to sharpen it, willing to read through the documentation, willing to work and get your hands dirty with configuration files to solve a problem, and of course, willing to fail. The reward goes beyond having your computer work just as you want it: you end up with a tool, a product that is truly yours ‚Äî something you can feel proud of, tangible and meaningful.\nDoes that mean that we should struggle every time we use our computer? Absolutely not. But we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t always strive to make technology easy to use, but instead try and make it easy to understand. Because if you\u0026rsquo;re able to make sense of things and truly know what\u0026rsquo;s going on, ease of use will come naturally.\nP.S. If you\u0026rsquo;re thinking about switching to Linux, my personal recommendation is Linux Mint. I recently installed it on a laptop and automatically detected Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and all network printers. No driver download required. It\u0026rsquo;s ready to use out of the box and highly customisable. And remember, you can keep Linux and your current operating system in the same computer if you want.\n VII.

Good posts this month. Bit of a smorgasbord, with stories covering all sorts of things. Most importantly, as was mentioned last month: I want to start a comic.\nHow do you go about starting a comic? I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much of a trick to it, as a first-timer ‚Äî you just have to ‚Äôstart‚Äô. It‚Äôs difficult for me, not just because I‚Äôm still learning to draw, but also because a comic in the Vekllei format should help the utopian ‚Äôsocial dream‚Äô of the project ‚Äî that‚Äôs what the ‚Äúauthor‚Äù category of posts means. So a comic would not just have to tell an exciting story with a linear plot and action ‚Äî it would have to be immersive; a guide to the world; something you could revisit time and time again without needing to follow a linear story. Figuring out how to do that is complicated. I‚Äôll set aside some time in September to start exploring this concept seriously.\nI‚Äôd also like to do a short animation/music video for a bit of fun. 80s technopunk vapourwave irony aesthetics are last year ‚Äî what about a bit of postwar austerity to anticipate the coming global recession? Forget bright-coloured sneakers and Windows 98 interfaces ‚Äî how about some council housing and cardigans?\nI guess we‚Äôll have to wait and see.\nThanks for reading, and I\u0026rsquo;d also like to thank the contributor to this edition, Bike (Milky), for their wonderful essay on Vekllei ecofeminism. It‚Äôs an excellent read ‚Äî check it out below. If you would like to contribute to The Atlantic with writing, art or reviews relevant to the spirit of petticoat ideology, please contact Hobart at melonkony@icloud.com before the 30th of September.\nThank you for supporting Vekllei, and best wishes.\nHobart Phillips Enjoy ‚Äî Ê•Ω„Åó„Çì„Åß\n I. News \u0026amp; Announcements\r#\r\r I‚Äôve gone back to work at the news organ I used to work at ‚Äî I might have a little less time, but I‚Äôll have a little more money, and that‚Äôs nice. Hoping to draw more in September, riding off the fun I had in August. The wiki (called Zelda Wiki ‚Äî good luck buying any domain with the word ‚ÄúZelda‚Äù in it) is coming along well. Rather than writing every article in advance ‚Äî a leviathan task ‚Äî I‚Äôm preparing a few intro docs covering the country of Vekllei and the characters of my story. It‚Äôs live now ‚Äî but good luck finding the URL for it. It‚Äôll be done before the end of the year, but it‚Äôs not nearly finished yet. The post ‚ÄúAbsolute Quiet‚Äù really took off on reddit and netted me nearly another 1,000 subscribers on r/vekllei. Awesome! It‚Äôs not hard to cross-post work and it pays off, especially as I get better. This piece worked out really well ‚Äî if only I could paint cities as nicely. That‚Äôs a long-term ambition, unfortunately. The website is ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù in big scare-quotes. It‚Äôs just a blog replicating reddit posts for now ‚Äî that‚Äôll change once the wiki is complete and accessible. The parallax isn‚Äôt cropped properly on mobile and there‚Äôs a few errors with icons loading in, but it‚Äôs better than the broken hub with no content that was there before. As a reminder, www.millmint.net and www.vekllei.com now redirect to www.millmint.studio!   II. Tzipora-watch\r#\r\rIn August of 2067, Tzipora wrote to the office of the Sun-Cola Beverage Company professing a love of their soda. The letter was so heartfelt and congratulatory that the chief operations officer invited her to tour their bottling plant in Demon, during which she met several of the staff responsible for her favourite flavours. They sent her home with a basketful of Sun-Cola merchandise and a wristwatch shaped like a bottle cap that still works to this day. Tzipora made a habit of writing to her favourite companies, and as a result has visited a lot of places of industry the ordinary person might never think to go.\n III. Vekllei Fact of the Month\r#\r\rDespite the prevalence of nuclear power in Vekllei, over 60 per cent of the country‚Äôs civil power is produced by geothermal and hydroelectric power stations. This is in part a result of Upen‚Äôs intuitive emphasis on renewable local resources (not just for sustainability, but for deep integration and dependence with the physical landscape), but also because much of Vekllei‚Äôs nuclear power is sold abroad via undersea powerlines in Europe and the United States, to supplement ageing fission plants.\n IV. WordBook\r#\r\rEndoanotetmouisa ‚Äî translates literally as ‚ÄúPrincess belonging to the Earth,‚Äù often mistranslated as ‚ÄúPrincess of the Earth‚Äù. A highly uncomfortable nickname given to Tzipora in a news article written about her, shortly after her first mainstream appearance ‚Äî a student documentary about building her house in Montre-Lola. Her interviews in the film sparked widespread interest in the girl, both for her medical condition and her extraordinary childhood, and so she spent much of the summer of 2083 in the Azores trying avoid this nickname.\n V. The Bulletin\r#\r\rAbsolute Grotesque\r#\r\rüìñ Published 31st August 2020 | Read here.\n\r On the morning of the second day, I watched a fly crawl across the cheek of the middle-aged woman, probably an office worker, lying next to me. It moved up her cheekbone to her temple, stopping now and then to rub its front legs as though performing a ritual. A jagged tear ran down the leg of her dark blue work trousers, but the white calf it revealed was miraculously unscathed. The woman lay still. Probably dead, I assumed. After a while, the fly got on to her eyelid. Suddenly, she reached up and brushed it away, opening the eye. There was still a moist light inside.\n From Insects, by Seirai Y≈´ichi\n By chance, the glass paperweight had survived. When her in-laws‚Äô house had burnt down in Yokohama, the paperweight was among those things that she‚Äôd frantically stuffed into an emergency bag, and now it was her only souvenir of life in her girlhood home.\n  From evening on, in the alley, she could hear the strange cries of the neighbourhood girls. Rumour had it that they could make a thousand yen in a single night. Now and then she would find herself holding the forty-sen paperweight she had bought after ten days of indecision when she was these girls‚Äô age, and as she studied the sweet little dog in relief, she would realise with a shock that there was not a single dog left in the whole burnt-out neighbourhood.\n From The Silver Fifty-Sen Pieces, by Kawabata Yasunari\nOn the 14th of August 2111, the Atomic War began in a Chinese submarine in the South Pacific, and ended six hours later. The war marks the single greatest loss of life in human history and would disrupt human life on Earth in previously unimaginable ways ‚Äî consumer society bottomed out, the world became small, the Earth grew cold, and a new chapter in human history was opened.\nThis political map marks the territories of Earth as they stand five years on, in 2116. There are fewer countries in the world today than in any other point in human history, in part because the catastrophic reduction in human population ‚Äî some 520-600 millions in the first year ‚Äî has emptied out countries and rendered others uninhabitable. Many of these territories here are disputed and, in some cases, autonomous ‚Äî for simplicity, they are presented as they are recognised by the U.N. The map also presents a long-exposure view of the war as it happened, and its remaining fallout currents today. Red dots mark significant nuclear detonations on August 14th. Yellow dots mark surface warfare in some capacity. Red trails mark missile flight, reduced in number here by strict denuclearisation treaties of the decades previous. Yellow trails mark the flight paths of atomic bombers, both supersonic and subsonic. This map does not record failed launches, intercepted missiles or downed aircraft.\nFighting was arranged along political axes ‚Äî namely Western (U.S., U.K., West Germany \u0026amp; N.A.T.O. members), Warsaw Pact (U.S.S.R., Cuba, Egypt), East Asian (China \u0026amp; Korea), and non-aligned (Vekllei, France, Brazil). The war experience was unique to each country ‚Äî Vekllei exchanged warheads and bombs with China but not Warsaw countries, the U.S.S.R. exchanged with both Western and East Asian members, and Brazil fought a catastrophic war against both Soviet and American territories. The immediate aftermath saw a quiet Earth, much of it scorched. Temperatures dropped by 10 degrees centigrade for the first six months, and slowly warmed as debris cleared in the following years. Wide-scale firestorms were tempered by rains that followed the war shortly.\nSome 274 millions of the dead are accounted for in China, where in 2116 the cities still lie in rot, swollen with corpses; heavy with miasma; concrete dams bleached and cracked; the wood all burned up; the rivers warped and quiet; dead fish along them; a surfaced water main weeping blood; harsh asbestine whistling; railcars in a ditch; sloughing skin; tremors; smoke with no fires; confused wandering; bleeding from the inside; families-as-sand; sand-as-trinitite.\nExchanges were confused, helter-skelter, and the combatants rattle off like a death snare. The U.S.S.R., the U.S., France, and Vekllei all exchanged death with China.\nIt would take more than mere annihilation to extinguish the P.R.C., but the toll was nauseating. Beijing and Shanghai were simply disappeared; there was nothing where there once was. The fistfuls of rebar and concrete amidst glassy, ossified landscape were heaped into direct administration of the U.N. The following year, 40-120 million more Chinese would succumb to the greatest famine in the history of the world. Of course, in the U.N., there was good argument for the nuclear retaliation ‚Äî China launched first; why should money and food go to the perpetrator of the vastest disaster in human history? One can‚Äôt help but wonder if the life of an Oriental coolie wells fewer tears than his equivalent in Paris. There are not enough flowers in the world to pay tribute to the dead of China, who were simply dispensed with in European memory and subsumed in part by the United Nations. The communist party would continue to control the vast interior, divided into two states by ethnography, where 1949 seemed closer than ever. Necrotic politics are legitimised in the land of the dead. Soon, we saw the consolidation of nation-states into geographic regions with a disregard for ethnography not seen since the colonial years. This was met with violent resistance in some places ‚Äî in others, locals capitulated to the extraordinary hyperreality of the postwar world.\nThe United Nations was quickly catapulted into the status of a de facto administrative world government in a last-ditch attempt to ‚Äòfreeze time‚Äô as it were, in order to provide the superpowers time to recover from the scope of immediate devastation and prevent humanity from entering a long period of decline. This involved the moving of soldiers on a scale unseen since the World Wars, as U.N. international brigades propped up vulnerable, scorched territories in Central/Western Europe and Asia. The immediate peace of the first days after the war was ruthlessly enforced ‚Äî and strategic opportunism was threatened to meet indiscriminate violence and U.N.-sanctioned nuclear retaliation. There was some belief that the status quo could carry on. So troops of non-combatant countries were supplied, and in some cases press-ganged, into this global mission.\nThe battered United States, acknowledging its ‚Äòcentury of decline‚Äô, found itself consolidating control over its urban, though devastated, coasts. The awkward appellation \u0026ldquo;Dallas America\u0026rdquo; was used as a colloquial shorthand for a disputed territory that insisted on referring to itself as the legitimate United States. The name was only superseded by the ridiculous \u0026ldquo;United Nations Heartlands of the United States,\u0026rdquo; the Aid Region of the U.S. interior that had collapsed in the days after the war. This was buffered by the Mojave and Great Lakes Special Administrative Regions, federal territories that contained war industry and nuclear infrastructure that propped up the precarious coasts. Despite efforts to revive agriculture in the scorched U.N. Heartlands U.S., starvation was met with martial law along the coasts the following year.\nThe U.N. was granted temporary, direct control over several collapsed territories that had either succumbed to nuclear fire or had caved to anarchy in the weeks and months after. In some cases, like the U.N. regions in Hawaii, Jerusalem and the Central Europe International War Government, these behaved as states in themselves, administrated directly by the United Nations Mission for War Recovery. In others, they were merely named as such with the vague promise of future aid. U.N. Cuba and U.N. Taiwan were such examples, in which devastation had been so catastrophic that little remained to govern, and the local population was mostly left to anarchy. In general, there were great inequalities in how the U.N. chose to dedicate resources, largely informed by its largest nation-states and political interests.\nThere are thousands of stories from communities and territories across the world directly impacted by the war ‚Äî from the atomic bombing of Sydney to the catastrophic reactor meltdowns of Brazil‚Äôs south. The war was unprecedented in scale and devastation. This map reveals little of the profoundly human tragedy that was brought about, nor does it invoke the difficult existential artefacts that are still being reckoned with. Perhaps humans are just animals after all ‚Äî destined to die out the way so many have in this age. Most tragic was not the colossal scale of death, or the collapse and pain that followed, but the upending of domestic society into violence, in which people of consumer society ‚Äî the middle class ‚Äî found themselves with not much at all, thrust into a world of chaos and suffering in which all prior epistemologies evaporated. Like the flash of blue light that preceded the roar, it was the stuff in supermarkets and department stores that marked the absolute grotesqueing of life in the new age.\n 2,000 members! WOW!\r#\r\rüìñ Published 27th August 2020 | Read here.\n\rHello,\nI‚Äôm Hobart. I‚Äôve been working on this project for a while now. It doesn‚Äôt really have a purpose or an end goal ‚Äî I just want to draw and write about nice things, and I‚Äôm learning a lot on the way. Welcome to everyone new here. I don‚Äôt really have anything to sell, I‚Äôd just like to thank you for tuning in and checking Vekllei out.\nI‚Äôve drawn Tzipora here as a sort of Sailor Moon knock-off. Good show that. The Japanese intro is very nostalgic, I‚Äôd love to do a little animated short in that style.\nI post about twice a week. I do a bit of everything ‚Äî machines, maps, characters, landscapes, architecture, etc. I‚Äôm truly a master of none.\nYou can come join the Discord if you‚Äôd like ‚Äî it‚Äôs just a quiet community to share interests and talk: discord.gg/dCE6vSU\nOtherwise, I‚Äôll keep doing what I‚Äôm doing and you can keep liking my stuff (please). If you have any questions about the project, or just want to introduce yourselves, here‚Äôs a good place to do it! Thank you kindly to all commenters, readers and friends of the project, whether you‚Äôve been here for years or for six hours ‚Äî it‚Äôs very special to have so many people interested in work that‚Äôs so close to my heart.\nKeep on keeping on,\nHobart\n Absolute Quiet\r#\r\rüìñ Published 24th August 2020 | Read here.\n\rThere were plumes in the sky, sent from bunkers buried deep in the well of the Earth, killing with switches. Vekllei went to war, and so Tzipora went to war with it.\nThe throbbing machinery of another world began turning, and anyone who saw the bomb would hear it. Passing seconds dislocated and caught heartbeats. The plumes were pretty. It was such a shame, those plumes. It was a quiet afternoon in the flower-tundras.\nThere was an absolute quiet among the grasses, and peace in her heart. She had work to do. She was a warden, after all ‚Äî and she‚Äôd done a good job spotting the missile before the sirens caught up. In truth, any devastation seemed incomprehensible. The flower-tundra would last forever. But that was her job, and she had to do it.\nShe left her bucket by the freshwater creek, intending to retrieve it a while later. The drinking water tasted better up here. She turned from the plume and followed the moss path out of the flower-tundra. Her village was before her.\nSo ended the old ways and so started the new.\n Rural Newda in Rural Vekllei\r#\r\rüìñ Published 17th August 2020 | Read here.\n\rNew gouache brushes, this painting was done on a single layer. turned out pretty good. more paintings to come.\n\rNewda is Vekllei‚Äôs national architectural ideology, applied flexibly in a range of modernist styles developed domestically in her architecture schools. Broadly, Newda buildings emphasise distinction from the surrounding landscape (called Dumousiantopet, or ‚Äòbeautiful and seperate‚Äô), natural decay, and honesty in material and construction. Vekllei‚Äôs great Parliament House is Newda; as are the little rural homes found in the mountains inland in Vekllei.\nTzipora‚Äôs house in the village of Montre-Lola (\ras depicted on the map here) is built in what Vekllei calls ‚ÄúAzores revivalism‚Äù, a Newda style heavily influenced by the stripped deco and streamline moderne buildings of a century prior. It is part of a constant conversation Newda holds with its past, as both a deeply modernist, progressive school and one bound up in the wider aesthetic and cultural traditions of Upen, the spiritualism of Vekllei.\nHer house is small, but appears larger due to the layout of the structure. A small sleeping loft sits atop the living, bathing and cooking areas of the home, and opens out into a private rooftop garden. The utilities tower also hides a small staircase leading to the roof, which is also accessible for outdoor recreation. Her home stands amidst the farmland of Montre-Lola, and very near the library and primary school where she works. Her property is marked at its end by a creek that runs into the Dentre River. She has a vegetable garden in her backyard, and shares her paddocks with her neighbours for grazing periodically throughout the year.\nHer house was erected in gratitude by her neighbours out of prefab components, and assisted by a ‚Äúconstruction line,‚Äù ‚Äî a temporary rail line in which goods are delivered and cranes are supported, minimising the need for lorries. Houses of this type and period are rarely seen in agricultural settings in other countries, but in Vekllei, where Landscape has been abolished, there might as well be no difference between a building suitable for the cosmopolitan, coastal cities and a dwelling for a farmer-girl.\n The Thousand-Year-Old Girl\r#\r\rüìñ Published 12th August 2020 | Read here.\n\rThe concept of living forever jumps out at people uncomfortable with their own existence. There is a contemplative instinct among educated people that ‚Äî if they could simply will themselves into a state of self-actualisation ‚Äî death would only be an obstacle to greatness.\nAs Tzipora found out quickly, the opposite was true ‚Äî death and temporality were wells of meaning against which all great people, beauty, and human constructions were cast.\nTzipora Desmoisnes is what is known as a Gregori Baby, a catch-all term for a unique genetic condition that has seemingly produced a variety of miracle children appropriate for the frothing futurism of the atomic age ‚Äî boys and girls who, suspended in the purity and good-naturedness of childhood ‚Äî live forever.\nThere is no single ‚ÄúGregori Baby‚Äù ‚Äî each is unique, and Tzipora is the 13th to have been recognised overall. The phrase is a shortening of Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome, a stand-in for medical information that isn‚Äôt there. The first, Gregori Hordiyenko, was born in 2024. He was healthy, and died of unrelated causes in his 20s. Tzipora, at 13th, continues to live to this day and is the oldest person on Earth.\nThere is a disturbing trend among the Gregori children, first heralded as miracles and symptoms of the space age, to deteriorate medically as more are born. The culprit is the malfunctioning of telomeres in their DNA ‚Äî the source of their longevity ‚Äî which regularly produce devastating chromosomal disorders, including Trisomy 13 \u0026amp; 18, killing most ‚Äúageless children‚Äù before their third birthday. Those that survive are often victims of a severe anaphylaxis caused by a hyperactive immune system ‚Äî rendering many of them permanently sickly. Others find themselves unageing, but continue to grow ‚Äî reaching as tall as 2.5m before their bodies give out from exhaustion and osteoporosis.\nSo what is Gregori syndrome? What does your average (healthy) Gregori baby look like? Their genetic miracle is linked to the structures of the body that activate at puberty, and so girls vary between 11-16 years of age at onset depending on many factors that affect their development. Boys tend to be a little younger, from 8-14. Between the two, girls tend to be more stable, and all but two of the supercentenarian Gregori children are female.\nAmong girls, they are prepubescent and generally stop ageing on the eve of menarche, or their first period. In Tzipora‚Äôs case, her body is estimated to be 13 years and 11 months old. Unlike many Gregori children, Tzipora lives in a wealthy country and has volunteered for extensive research into her genetic makeup, meaning that much of early medical documentation around Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome was received directly from her case.\nMost obvious is that, at a foundational level, her cells are similar in function to unipotent stem cells, and have been since hormones at the end of thelarche suspended her ageing. This change has occurred somewhere in her DNA ‚Äî exactly where is unknown ‚Äî but the end result is that, unlike regular progenitor cells that make up most adult bodies, the building blocks of her body are capable of cell-renewal. Her telomeres, the endcaps of chromosomal DNA in mammals, are undamaged. And so there is an amazing shift in her basic human structure ‚Äî in which human cell lineage, which usually ends in a mature cell incapable of division, is caught and rearranged. With this considered, it is no wonder that Gregori children suffer from such catastrophic chromosomal instability, and why healthy ageless babies are a rarity. Her body is not exactly a ‚Äúbody of stem cells,‚Äù but for their function in a healthy Gregori child, they might as well be.\nSo it is that nothing about Tzipora is changing. She suffers from pains in her legs often ‚Äî called growing pains, although they are not from growing ‚Äî and her cells continue to replenish, albeit at a rate 1.25 times that of normal people. She is, in essence, ‚Äúgrowing‚Äù as any other premenarchal girl would, but she is not getting bigger or becoming older.\nTzipora is blessed with an adult life in Vekllei, where the ‚ÄúChild‚Äù does not exist as it does in the West, and her individual freedoms are far-ranging. She may smoke, and drink, and has held many different jobs in her life. She holds two doctorates in English and Vekllei Literature. She is obviously sterile ‚Äî even if she were to somehow ‚Äúage out‚Äù of prepubescence into pubescence and receive the required hormones, she simply lacks the genetic code to reproduce ‚Äî but raises many children through her active participation in village life and her roles as Montre-Lola‚Äôs municipal and school librarian.\nIn other countries, with coded roles for children, their problems are much greater. Unable to form adult relationships and often incapable of finding work, many work in entertainment or fall into poverty as they outlive their friends and parents. Socially ostracised and forever young, many are victims of superstition and fear. As the pattern of Gregori children indicates an increase in mortality, even as more are born, their appearance is both a miracle and a tragedy ‚Äî ageing not through mitosis but through weathering the societies in which they live.\n The 31st Century ‚Äî Vekllei throughout our Solar System\r#\r\rüìñ Published 9th August 2020 | Read here.\n\rWe‚Äôve spent a lot of time in the 21st century ‚Äî but Tzipora is biologically immortal. Where does she go from here? Well, let‚Äôs enjoy a small glimpse at that future together, by winding the clock forward one thousand years.\nBy 3076, our Solar System is a pleasant place to be. Most of the planets we once gazed at from afar are now habitable and lived on. The Great Epoch of Rest has begun.\nThere is no great interstellar empire, no rise and fall of spacefaring supernations ‚Äî a Vekllei way of life is now lived out in multicultural, prosperous clusters of people across our Solar System. The ordinary person is afforded incredible freedoms previously reserved for science fiction through the accessibility of personal light spacecraft, translated literally as ‚Äúboats‚Äù.\nThis here is the M-7000 APRICOT, manufactured by the Government Aerospace Factories (GAF) of Vekllei. Many companies are contracted by the GAF, including General Reactor S.A., to whom this boat lends most of its flight control systems and all of its power plant. It is a light, personal boat for women built in 2807, making it relatively unique in both its 28th century design language and its gendered marketing. While the personal boat market was growing rapidly by this time, the vast majority of owners and pilots were men. The APRICOT set out to change that, and Tzipora, the world‚Äôs oldest living person with a youthful face, was among the first to demonstrate the accessibility and freedoms of space travel for women and girls in the personal boat market. It was her first boat, and despite its orientation for women it was christened with a male name: BARON.\nIt is a comfortable and pleasant craft that can be lived in for extended periods of time. Tzipora has done just that, travelling to stars in search of water-planets with Micronesian archipelagos, where she likes to spend most of her time. Its glass roof across the entire accessible cabin, including bubbled cockpit, gives it breathtaking visibility in the depths of space and the most scenic of planets alike. Like almost all spacecraft, it is unarmed, save for the pacifying ‚Äújazz‚Äù electric canon, named for its firing sound reminiscent of a double bass strum.\nWhen she tires of being alone, she returns to her hometown of Montre-Lola in Vekllei frequently. Boats are usually parked at off-world stations, preserving the aerospace and quiet of the Solar System. Light speed is exceeded through superluminal travel. So-called black boxes require extraordinarily precise programming, since superluminal travel is in all ways but name time travel, and the universe does not tolerate time travel. Coordinates calculated in the universal pyramid system by a pyramid computer ensure that a vessel arrives when it arrives, so to speak. The alternative is going nowhere at all ‚Äî there is no in-between.\nSuperluminal systems are affected by gravity, so any person looking to exceed the speed of light and subsequently visit other stars must take the highways beyond our home system‚Äôs planetary orbit and launch into so-called free-travel from there. There are only a handful of these highways ‚Äî the solar system is very, very large, and human construction is very, very small.\nThere was an instinct among many people that human progress would naturally scale exponentially ‚Äî these were extrapolated from the remarkable progress in the lifetime of Tzipora‚Äôs parents and grandparents, who saw canvas aircraft in their childhood advance to the landing of a man on the moon, and again in her own exaggerated lifetime, in which the provinciality of her youth has simultaneously seen an expansion and exploitation of the planets in our native solar system.\nThis curve of progress was not to be, however ‚Äî and it also explains why we had such trouble meeting aliens in the first place. Part of it was simply that there are very few worlds with water that also formed earthlike landmasses nearby ‚Äî there are many aliens, and Tzipora has seen many herself, but most of them are fish and fish-adjacent. The second is that, if there is civilised life out there, it has most probably encountered the same engineering truths that humanity did, in our great interstellar project of the last thousand years. Namely that, all accounted for, there is no use for wasteful megastructures when a small one will do. People are having less children ‚Äî on Mars, Mercury and Neptune, the population is actually shrinking. What good is the so-called ‚Äúocean liner of the stars,‚Äù with a capacity of millions? There are around 12 billion people across the solar system today. Maybe another 8 billion in the Ala system. Maybe a few millions more who have simply given up society for scattered stars in our neighbourhood.\nIt is likely that if any other civilised races exist, they are simply of our scale, or have destroyed themselves completely in the reckless pursuit of expansion. Humanity is lucky not to count themselves among them.\nThe APRICOT is one of many models produced by Vekllei‚Äôs Government Aerospace Factories. It is now possible for the ordinary person to explore distant stars for themselves, granting freedoms unimaginable in a previous age. Such is life in the Great Epoch of Rest.\n VI. The Post Office\r#\r\rNot a Particularly Environmentalist Bunch: Vekllei‚Äôs Feminist Natureculture [NEW]\r#\r\rBY MILKY#0144\nAll direct quotes are from Melon‚Äôs Reddit posts or saved from his previous website.\nThink about nature. Picture it in your mind. What do you see? Are there any buildings? Do you see your friends, or any people at all? What adjectives might you use to describe it? How do you interact with nature in your mind?\nThere is a divide between human society and what is considered ‚Äònature‚Äô ‚Äì landscapes, national parks or forests, beaches, mountain trails, campgrounds\u0026hellip; Nature is often seen as a place you visit and a place you come home from. A temporary escape from societal woes. A vacation spot; perhaps someplace nostalgic. A special area, with boundaries and signs and info centers, that should be protected. It has also been seen as something owed to humans ‚Äì wilderness to be tamed and dominated, or land to be cleared, excavated, drilled, and paved for capitalist human use.\nTraditional environmental ethics heavily involves romantic, heroic, and nurturing narratives in regard to the relationship among humans, nonhuman animals, and this ‚Äònature.‚Äô Empathy, care, and connection have been key in ecofeminist discourse on environmentalism and nonhuman animal rights. These values are traditionally feminine, and environmentalism is often seen as feminine as a result. Terms like treehugger exemplify the feminine care given by environmentalists. Another term, ‚Äòsoy boy,‚Äô does not necessarily point to environmentalists, but ‚Äòsoy‚Äô being a feminine quality implies alternatives to animal products being something only for women.\nParallel to environmentalism being a feminine work, nature is often coded as female. Mother Nature nurtures living beings, feeding plants and animals alike. Western romantic authors wrote comparisons between women and nature and were inspired by both alike. They are something beautiful to look at and something to find inspiration in. They are pure and untouched until man/humans tame and mold them.\n‚ÄúVekllei is a fundamentally female country. This is what petticoat society means.‚Äù This does not mean that the feminised, pure, idealised nature persists. Take our protagonist Tzipora for example. She is female, yet not an idealised maternal woman that could possibly be confused for a Mother Nature figure. She is an eternal child, neither pure or innocent, nor in need of care and protection. If we consider the following quote, however, we can see how Tzipora‚Äôs situation reflects or is reflected in Vekllei‚Äôs unique environmentalist situation: ‚ÄúVekllei is not alienated from its landscape but exists very much within it. Vekllei people do not consider themselves different from nature \u0026ndash; they exist alongside everything else in the landscape. Their environment is not exploited, and so its protection is not necessitated through its abstraction and alienation, of which environmentalism is a symptom (as a reaction to exploitation).‚Äù Though Tzipora is very different from the rest of her community, she is not alienated from those around her. She is enmeshed in Vekllei‚Äôs culture and society and dutifully participates in school and work. She is inseparable from her environment.\nIn fact, ‚ÄúVekllei has abolished landscape, deconstructing its vicious abstractionism.‚Äù In Vekllei, nature is not seen as ‚Äòother‚Äô or as romantically female, and this binary of human/nature has been removed. Of course, it is impossible to abolish landscape and our artist would not paint and describe such rich landscapes if they no longer existed. Paintings of Vekllei often depict Zelda and co., concrete buildings, and railways contrasted with the country‚Äôs rolling hills, grassy plains, and volcanic rock. The combination of humans and both their built and ‚Äònatural‚Äô environs is what makes up the Vekllei landscape, as there is no separation in Vekllei between nature and society. Everything in each painting is the natural landscape of Vekllei.\nSo, what has been abolished is the idea that nature is another place, something separate than the culture of Vekllei. In the 2020 Vekllei Handbook, MelonKony writes: ‚ÄúWe are not a particularly environmentalist bunch, since we\u0026rsquo;re not alienated from our land, and we‚Äôre certainly not sentimental, but we do understand the relationship our lives have with our surrounds, and the utility and protection of nature is important to us as a lifestyle and a spiritual tenant of Upen.‚Äù\nIf the respectful utility and protection of nature is important, wouldn‚Äôt such a way of living with nature, being human as part of the natural world, lead to environmentalism? Not necessarily. ‚ÄúNature is a fellow social organ, like society or family, and so Vekllei is not ‚Äòenvironmentalist‚Äô in the Western idea of the word but instead makes use of and protects its natural environment for the benefit of both themselves and the land.‚Äù\nThink now about what surrounds you. The air, your room, your home, your town, and beyond. When you think about what is important to you about the natural world, imagine what your Ghibli/Tintin landscape would look like. Don‚Äôt forget to include the buildings and people in your orbit. There is no real boundary between you and the community you live and work in and the larger ‚Äúnatural world.‚Äù It is all part of the natural world. No need to call yourself particularly environmentalist even if you care about the world around you. You are still just as enmeshed with nature as our Vekllei friends are.\n VII.

News \u0026amp; Announcements\r#\r\r Huge advancements on the website, which will likely launch sometime this month. Watch this space! If you‚Äôve missed previous bulletins, they‚Äôll be available in full on the site along with a comprehensive wiki and post archive. The wiki supports live switching between multiple languages ‚Äî if you‚Äôre bilingual (or for that matter, trilingual!) and have some interest in translating a few pages, let me know! Quiet month on the subreddit, but managed to work on a little animation that turned out quite nice! See below. My thesis is due on the 23rd of October ‚Äî this means that content will pick up for the remainder of the year. I plan to launch the comic in November. That‚Äôs all. Quiet month ‚Äî not a bad thing in the slightest.   II. Tzipora-watch\r#\r\rIn September of 2073, Tzipora began work at the Lola District Library at the age of 26, a move that would develop within her a love of librarianship that would see her enrol in Montre-Lola University to study literature two years later. Her time at Lola was spent managing loans and navigating visitors through the vast archives beneath by way of a light monorail.\n III. Vekllei Fact of the Month\r#\r\rUpen designates a hierarchy in the human body as part of ritualistic processions. The heart, depicted as a crown, is considered the most sacred. The brain and hands are next, and the rest of the body is catalogued and ordered ending with the feet. Feet are considered unclean in Vekllei and is part of the reason why shoes are not worn indoors. This hierarchy, called Lohsmi, is a minor cultural force but is important in the physical formation of runes, or Upotenne (spirit-hand-talk).\n IV. WordBook\r#\r\rSpiousn ‚Äî difficult to translate, spiousn describes the feeling of regaining energy after a long period of exhaustion. It can be applied to a sick person becoming well, or more contemporaneously to a student after the exam period. This word forms a component of the slang spiousnya, which refers to the break from school at the end of the year. In this sense, its meaning translates to ‚Äúschool break‚Äù but carries with it a sentiment of peace and recovery.\n V. The Bulletin\r#\r\rBaron, the Father\r#\r\rüìñ Published 30th September 2020 | Read here.\n\rPeople are not sure what to make of Baron. They are not sure what to make of his daughter, Tzipora, either. To that end, they are lucky to have found each other.\nHis obscurity is part of a severe disposition, made obvious by his astonishing disinterest in friends and hobbies. When he finishes work, he listens to the radio, prepares supper, and goes to bed. His unrelenting seriousness is mitigated by his general passivity ‚Äî Baron is a man totally in control, who keeps to himself and does not take issue with what goes on around him. For his seriousness he is not particularly judgemental or opinionated. To call him boring would be a poor characterisation; he simply feels he has done enough and is not looking to complicate the basic equations of his life.\nTzipora (Zelda to him) complicates this equation. She‚Äôs similar to him in many ways, with her conservative personal disposition and humble lifestyle. She does not make a very good teen-ager.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs funny you say that. I was talking to her the other day, and she was talking about how nice it was to have some peace and quiet,‚Äù Baron once confided in Ayn. ‚ÄúOf course, she looks very young, so sometimes you have to remind yourself that she‚Äôs not a child. She‚Äôs not thirteen, she‚Äôs nineteen, and very unusual, I think. She‚Äôs very smart but she doesn‚Äôt let that on much.‚Äù\nTzipora did not really have ‚Äúphases‚Äù ‚Äî Tzipora was Tzipora, eternal. But she was a much more emotionally attuned person, and her highs were higher and her lowers were lower than anything Baron had felt in decades.\nHe was not always so unfeeling. Baron‚Äôs Ashkenazim parents were pulled straight from the bubbling diaspora of Eastern Europe. They met in the labour zionist movement, but fell out of love with professional organising and immigrated to a struggling Vekllei to work in the national hydroelectricity scheme, among thousands of immigrants employed by the Thunderburo.\nHe was born in 2027 and was not very interested in school as a child. He was rebellious and obstinate, and had only vague ambitions of acquiring a trade certificate in motorcycle repair. His sister, Amelie, died of tuberculosis when he was 11. That was about the end of school ambitions for him.\nHe started conscription early and spent his high school years in an army college. By the time he was 18, he was transferred to military police. It was 2045. He had started dating a middle school sweetheart, Ayn, two weeks before the war in Taiwan broke out.\nYoung Baron died in Taiwan, and another figure in his body returned. He was transferred almost immediately to a junior post at the Americas Bureau at National Intelligence (AB/NI), where he would spend the next decade. While he was stationed abroad, his mother died and his father followed. By this time, Baron was a significant asset for Vekllei‚Äôs deep autonomous intelligence work ‚Äî apolitical, unattached, unsentimental and steady on his feet. He was destined to die in Colombia, employed indefinitely and waiting to be used up. In 2063, he met a fellow Spanish-speaking Jew by name of Tzipora.\nIn many ways, his identity is as fractured as Tzipora‚Äôs, whose Jewish European ancestry was a novel curiosity and not much more. She considered herself a Latina-American until she was Vekllei, and since then she has not been anything more. That was how it went in Vekllei‚Äôs grand secular melting pot. Tzipora was still ta bubeleh to him, but by his mid-thirties Baron had lost most of his mother‚Äôs Yiddish. Tzipora is his closest friend and daughter at the same time. She is a wholly energetic and independent agent in his life, and their relationship alternates awkwardly but intuitively between father-daughter and old friends. Ayn wonders if it is not a coincidence that Tzipora looks like Amelie, his sister.\nThe two of them champion the redemption of losers; the adrift, empty people of the world, acting on a chance to salvage a life and family. Tzipora expected to die in America; Baron expected nothing at all. But when Christmas comes around, and Ayn visits for supper, Taiwan and America melt into air; and their apartment houses the only Jewish Christmas tree in the neighbourhood.\n Little Bouncy Zelda ‚Äî an animation diary\r#\r\rüìñ Published 27th September 2020 | Read here.\n\rIt\u0026rsquo;s been a week since I\u0026rsquo;ve posted. Most of that was spent drawing the same thing over and over.\nA painting? Please. That\u0026rsquo;s a day\u0026rsquo;s work ‚Äî maybe two. A five second loop of Tzipora jumping in and shuffling over? A week.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s difficult to grasp just how much work animation is until you try it. This runs at 12 frames per second (which dickheads will recognise as the anime frame rate). There are maybe 38 unique frames in this tiny animation. It\u0026rsquo;s a title card for my imaginary studio, MillMint, in case I ever make videos in the future.\nThe sketch was fun. It comes alive ‚Äî your precious characters become real. Then comes the inking. 38 lines traced and polished. Then comes the colouring. Good lord, the colouring. It isn\u0026rsquo;t just labour-intensive \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s mind-numbingly boring.\nThis animation has a lot of little imperfections. No, I\u0026rsquo;m not fixing them :)\nRegular post tomorrow to make up for a week of empty suffering. Thanks for looking. Let me know what you think!\n Memory and Death in the Flower Tundra\r#\r\rüìñ Published 19th September 2020 | Read here.\n\rIt was their first hike after Maya‚Äôs funeral. She had found adult life completely disappointing, and never moved out of home. In her last summer, she developed a desperate fascination with her receding childhood, and eventually took her own life outside of the classroom she‚Äôd studied in as a third-grade student.\nHer death deeply disturbed Tzipora, who was keenly aware of how sentimental people died against metrics of their own imagination. She wondered if the government architects who designed schools and universities considered how those spaces gave life to memories. They were filled with lunchtimes and puppy love and old friends and your parents ‚Äî and those things folded into brick and concrete and linoleum floors. Fifty years earlier, some architect designed a classroom so valuable that Maya took her own life in the memory of it.\nTheir Puffling troop had set off for a camp site two hours away. Tzipora and Zo did not walk with them. They followed the flower tundra north, near where Zo and Maya had played as kids. At the base of an old oak, shrouded in a cool mist, Zo buried a pair of plastic earrings and laced school shoes, neither of which had been worn in a long time. Zo started to cry. Tzipora gave her some time to herself. After a while they drank hot tea with their feet in the creek. The mist had closed them in. There was good reason why people travelled to flower-tundras to meet with the dead. The mirror-pools and tombstone drumlins invoked the spirits.\nAfter the tea, Zo pulled out her map and they set off again for the camp site, leaving the tree behind forever.\n Some kind of gay sketch for my cool subreddit. Cobian and Zelda \u0026ldquo;head-over-heels‚Äù\r#\r\rüìñ Published 17th September 2020 | Read here.\n\rmake love not lore\n Matchstick Girl\r#\r\rüìñ Published 14th September 2020 | Read here.\n\rAnother paint-sketch ‚Äî a painting done fast. I‚Äôm trying to learn to a) paint and b) paint on an industrial scale.\nShe‚Äôd missed the fast tram, caught a tiny splinter in her thumb, lost a button and now the match wouldn‚Äôt strike. It just wasn‚Äôt her day.\nThey were in Callaisn (pronounced ka-lane), a borough of the capital Tzipora regarded as ‚Äúthe worst of them‚Äù for its tall buildings and labyrinthian concrete alleys. ‚ÄúBad people, bad food, bad smells‚Äù she said, flashing the tact she was known for. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go home.‚Äù\nCallaisn was an oddity, built largely by the British during the occupation years in the fashion of London. It was nonetheless a thoroughly Vekllei borough, with its parks and tramways and rivulets, but it had a continental skyline marked by tower blocks and skyscrapers. A lot of boring business was done in Callaisn that Tzipora didn‚Äôt care about.\nCobian frowned as Tzipora rotated a second match between her thumb and finger. She didn‚Äôt like this nasty little habit she‚Äôd picked up. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll smell like your dad if you keep this up,‚Äù she said.\n‚ÄúSuits me,‚Äù said Tzipora.\n Road Trip\r#\r\rüìñ Published 11th September 2020 | Read here.\n\rThey showed up at the autopool, and someone had just returned a brand new AAAC Voya Voya ‚Äî incredible. It was like Christ himself had blessed them. It only (barely) seat five, and there were six of them, but it wasn‚Äôt a problem. Moise would drive, Tzipora bunked with Cobian in the passenger seat and Alise, Zo and Jerome could cram into the back. It was a squeeze but with the top down and on the coastal highway it couldn‚Äôt have mattered less. It was the car of late summer.\nZo had just married Jerome, and they had recently moved in with each other at age 17. Tzipora had no metrics to figure out if that was too young, but Zo was her friend and young newlyweds were lonely people. She was all too ready to volunteer her labour (and that of Cobian and Moise) to drive them down to Koisniya and pick them up a coffee machine she‚Äôd ordered six months prior. Tohs S.p.A. was a good company but Tohs himself was a disorganised bastard and he‚Äôd rung up to a few times to tell her the order had been delayed. Then she called him back a month later and he said he‚Äôd never received the order. So it was that they were on their way now, well after Zo and Jerome had married, to pick up the wedding gift. That was just how things worked in Vekllei.\nZo‚Äôs friend Alise sat the coffee machine in her lap on the way back, and as the coastal highway reached Vik it skirted an incredible series of cliffs that they stopped to look at. The wind was out and the Atlantic churned beneath. The sun was hot on their skin. The coffee machine was left on the tiny back seat as they got out to have a look and take a picture.\n Clean Faces; Full Hearts: Uniforms in Vekllei [8.9.2020]\r#\r\rüìñ Published 8th September 2020 | Read here.\n\rIn Vekllei, uniforms are prevalent across all levels of society. They are perhaps the most obvious example of the opaque contradictions at the heart of Vekllei life, caught between wholly opposing ideas: between tradition and progress; liberty and control; and, most crucially here ‚Äî between individualism and the burden of society.\nDepicted here are uniforms for education ‚Äî Tzipora as a puffling of the Puffin Scouts on the left, and the others in mere school uniforms. These uniforms are universal and used across all ages of schooling, from kindergarten to university. Even some teachers wear them ‚Äî it starts to stretch the conventional imagination about what constitutes a uniform.\nA few observations on this picture:\nFirst, these uniforms are used interchangeably across ages and disciplines. The difference between a red pleat skirt and a navy skirt is trivial; it is merely a difference in the meaning of the clothing, as part of Vekllei semaphore. They are both equally the school-mandated uniform of education, and can be worn interchangeably from one day to the next, in third grade and at university.\nSecond, there are many small uniquenesses in the uniform of each person, which are accentuated by their surrounding uniformity. Tzipora‚Äôs school shirt is pleated along the buttons, acquired off the rack of a department store. One pair of trousers might be a slightly different shade to the pair next to it. These discrepancies are not regarded as malfunctions of the uniform system, since the system is not designed to make each student conform to a single appearance ‚Äî it is about identity and convenience in a country that spent many decades clawing its way out of abject poverty.\nThese principles apply across many workplaces and in government, too ‚Äî where uniforms are not intended to only signify publicly a place of work but instead form social bonds through clothing, which are intimate factors of ordinary life. In Vekllei, clothes are not an expression of personality, but items to communicate and bond with, regulated not by an authority demanding strict conformity but a desire for identity, physicality, infrastructure and convenience.\nSuch a state of affairs is unimaginable in some countries, especially beyond collectivist or conformist cultures. Individualist intuition suggests that uniforms are actively detrimental to personal expression ‚Äî but this idea demands a scale of expression far beyond the preference for subtlety and delicateness in Upen. Deviations from uniformity, like earrings, the way hair is worn, wristwatches, makeup and minor irregularities accentuate the value of those things, and make them more important. This aesthetic contrast is at the heart of the wider Upen intuition that you can see in architecture and political priority alike. And, as any Vekllei boy will tell you ‚Äî seeing a classroom crush out of uniform for the first time is a religious experience, and only afforded by scarcity.\nVekllei is an individualist society, modelled after self-concern and self-love by a salt-of-the-earth and larrikin people of my native Australia. This is not a people compatible with conventional thinking on the regulation of appearance ‚Äî but, as with many things in Vekllei, both are held true at the same time. They are a free and unrestrained population clothed at work and in school in clothes gifted to them. As an addendum, although many readers find common ancestry with Japan in this project (not unreasonably, either), Vekllei has more in common in some ways with the distant neighbours of my Australian homeland ‚Äî countries that haven‚Äôt been glamorised in the West through culture export. Thailand, Cambodia and Laos are among them ‚Äî coincidentally, all three are rare examples of countries where university students wear uniforms.\nSomeday, we‚Äôll look at the aesthetics of power and authority-worship, inspired at least in part by the history and culture of these countries, and associate them with cultural forces in Vekllei.

Big announcements, short bulletin.\nI‚Äôve started work on Atomic Modern, better known as ‚Äôthe Vekllei comic.‚Äô I‚Äôm about five pages in so far. I have a distinct style of illustration, but that doesn‚Äôt always translate well to a panel format, and navigating that fact has been a real challenge. Generally, pages are just taking too long ‚Äî about half a page a day so far. How on earth do some authors produce 500-page tomes? I‚Äôm working on fixing that.\nPatrons will see pages this week! How exciting. I‚Äôll also be in close contact with patrons regarding the upcoming $100/month milestone, and how best to celebrate it.\nAlthough this month was dominated by conversation about the comic, we also saw a mix of posts this month of various types and styles. In future, while balancing regular comic production, I‚Äôll be looking at trimming traditional posts down to about once a week (as in this month) and putting efforts into finishing the website and polishing posts on the subreddit. I want to reign things in a bit ‚Äî explore different samples of Vekllei life playfully and efficiently, and dispense for a moment the traditional story posts, which will be supplemented by the linear story of the comic.\nFinally, if you would like to contribute to The Atlantic with writing, art or reviews relevant to the spirit of petticoat ideology, please contact Hobart at melonkony@icloud.com before the 30th of November.\nThank you for supporting Vekllei, and best wishes.\nHobart Phillips Enjoy ‚Äî Ê•Ω„Åó„Çì„Åß\n I.

At some point in future, once it‚Äôs marked and returned, it‚Äôll be archived on the site alongside other essays I‚Äôve worked on. The site is not done! I‚Äôll be looking to finish the main articles this month, and contributing regularly to expand the content of the site. I‚Äôd rather have fewer, high-quality articles than many stub or low-quality articles. I‚Äôll also be looking for volunteers to help translate the main page and perhaps a key article for newcomers. The Atlantic Bulletin will be archived on the site, so if you‚Äôve missed editions you‚Äôll be able to read them there. The first few pages of the comic will arrive for free on the subreddit sometime this month.   II. Tzipora-watch\r#\r\rIn November of 2064, Tzipora would begin work as a junior commis chef at a local Spanish restaurant, training under immigrant head chef (and proud Spaniard) Valentino ‚ÄúVal‚Äù Martinez. Tzipora could scarcely speak Vekllei and was berated incessantly by Martinez, who saw her has slow-witted and untalented. In time, however, Tzipora would prove her culinary ability and made good use of her talents at home, preparing simple, fresh cooking in a new country that celebrates local food. She would rise to the rank of sous chef, and enjoyed her work there until she left to finish high school the next year.\n III. Vekllei Fact of the Month\r#\r\rUnusually for a country often regarded as European, Vekllei has little popular conception of the Second World War. Although a member of the Axis powers from 1936 thru 1941, Vekllei‚Äôs small navy was entirely sunk within months of the war‚Äôs opening by British naval dominance in the North Atlantic, and by 1942 was press-ganged as a staging point for American aircraft. Vekllei students only spend a few weeks learning about WW2 in mandatory history classes, and it rarely appears in popular culture, a cultural artefact attributed to the general distaste for Junta-era history and the minor role the country played in the war.\n IV. WordBook\r#\r\rSukish ‚Äî pronounced ‚Äúsookie,‚Äù Sukish describes the sensation of warm sunlight on bare skin. Derived from the Loh glossary, it is gentle and playful despite Loh‚Äôs association with moonlight and winter, and is often used poetically in advertisements and ceremonial speech to suggest new beginnings and rebirth. Pictographically, is is depicted as a sun on a crown. Spend too long in the sun, however, and you might suffer Acelouliah, which is the literal word for burning, and is used equally to describe sunburn and burning food.\n V. The Bulletin\r#\r\rMajor Announcement: A Vekllei Comic\r#\r\rüìñ Published 27th October 2020 | Read here.\n\rHi everyone,\n\u0026ldquo;He not busy being born is busy dying,\u0026rdquo; ‚Äî that‚Äôs off a Bob Dylan bootleg. I‚Äôve just finished my thesis and I‚Äôm busy being born again. Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm busy dying. Drawing‚Äôs been the way out for a long time now.\nAs of today I‚Äôm starting work full-time on a Vekllei comic called Atomic Modern. The front cover looks like a textbook. The name is not that interesting. That‚Äôs okay ‚Äî apparently my honours in media didn‚Äôt do anything for my marketing ability, but this project is about celebrating mundanity and restraint. Tzipora‚Äôs got a fag in her mouth but it isn‚Äôt lit. I feel like that a lot of the time. It‚Äôs a self-contained image.\nAtomic Modern is about Tzipora and Vekllei. It‚Äôs about her friends and her memories and all the good and bad parts of her life. It‚Äôs about what went down in America and how you can justify living. It‚Äôll have beautiful Vekllei landscapes and characters in muted colour. It will also include passages that act as a guide to Vekllei and society ‚Äî diagrams, infographics and footnotes. It‚Äôs also an escape from everything going on right now ‚Äî there‚Äôs good and bad in all stories, but at the end of the day Vekllei is a utopia.\nI will publish pages here for free. I‚Äôll collate them into chapters available exclusively to my patrons. Maybe some extra stuff too. I‚Äôm a good dad to my patrons. I already made a set of postcards and sent them out. Either way, you‚Äôll continue to see stuff here. This is exciting, isn‚Äôt it? This is a new chapter for me as an artist. It‚Äôs a vulnerable moment for me, because up until now it‚Äôs just sort of been ‚Äúposting on reddit‚Äù. I don‚Äôt have a publisher, I‚Äôm not trained, I‚Äôm just some guy. But this is what I‚Äôve always wanted to do, and I‚Äôm trying to get busy being born again.\nThere should be regular world posts here still. There‚Äôs drawings I like to do that just don‚Äôt fit into a comic format. I think during weekdays I‚Äôll work on the comic and on weekends I‚Äôll do a painting. We‚Äôll see how it goes.\nAlso, I‚Äôll have a nice big wiki soon with multiple language support. I‚Äôll let you know when it‚Äôs done.\nLet‚Äôs start this again, with all that off my chest.\nHi, I‚Äôm Hobart. I‚Äôm busy getting born again.\nMuch love,\nMelonKony\n\rJoin the Vekllei Patreon.\n\rJoin the Vekllei Discord.\nBe ‚Äúpetticoat‚Äù.\n All That‚Äôs Solid Melts into Zelda\r#\r\rüìñ Published 18th October 2020 | Read here.\n\r My nerves are like overused sandpaper‚Äîall dull; only the eye-catching, bizarre and grotesque can excite me now.\n Tanizaki JunichiroÃÑ, 1918\nThe wind had died and it seemed that she would follow it. Crazy shadows distorted beneath car headlights. It occurred to her in some way that, as she approached dying, she was living out the ultimate dramatic fantasy of the American misplaced girl, in the same way the townsmen were fulfilling their grotesque constellation of death by murdering women. To them, she was not Zelda, or an agitator, or even a maid from Motel Grande; she was just a girl of girl-form, washed out; beat in; bent before the death-bridge where the creek rolled on below. It was brutal and violent, and also the most tacky thing. It scaled up and down, because it was murdering.\nThe hearts of America are like overused sandpaper ‚Äî all dull. This is how it played out in 2063, ages into the Great American Decline and well before it was put down like a sick dog by Chinese methods. The worn out bodies of the hedonistic coasts were numb to the spectacle of collapse and found themselves displaced and unfeeling, and so the neurotic motions of vampiric culture barons responded. In 2036, long before the Dallas Secession or Zelda‚Äôs birthday, the NBC under the Radio Corporation of America broadcast the first televised execution in the United States of child serial killer Wayne Graham. This enticed similar coverage across all major television networks for subsequent executions, which were viewed by millions of Americans. The format culminated in NBC‚Äôs The American Justice Show programme, in which the method and subject of broadcasted executions were made participatory by public poll. It was tremendously successful but was cancelled in 2041, after the botched death of George Kovacs.\nThis is not necrotic; this is neurotic; it is the ultimate sucking up of human desire into the commodity-form, and it was only the beginning. It is not just a poetic coincidence that the cancellation of American Justice saw the legalisation (or at the very least, decriminalisation) of prostitution in all regions but the Deep South over the next decade (which would contribute to the eventual secession). This is pleasure in its raw form, and the murder of prostituted immigrant-labourers and the eroticisation of the death of Wayne Graham‚Äôs teen-age victims was one and the same. The necroticisation would arrive later, as modernity tumoured and pleasure outpaced the sovereignty of the federal government.\nHere was Zelda, who was a perfect caricature of the real American in the 21st century ‚Äî born overseas, poor as shit, and dressed up for dying. And why shouldn‚Äôt she die? All the old things were dead. God, kings, outrage, empathy, optimism ‚Äî it was all thrown in the creek, with the rest of the immigrant-labourers. Why shouldn‚Äôt a child and her sensitivity be among them? You could change the channel on television and see pornography and the brutal violence of the Secession adjacent to each other. If you clicked the knob back and forth fast enough, they could become one and the same.\nTzipora was the last to arrive and among the first to be lynched, and maybe they would make postcards out of her dead body. She couldn‚Äôt even wonder this in her terror; the thought would only occur to her much later. It seemed like the whole Great American Decline, in all its hungry decomposition and hedonism was leading to this single moment ‚Äî and all that was once solid melts into Zelda.\n Petrol Heaven: The Rohsm STR-750\r#\r\rüìñ Published 13th October 2020 | Read here.\n\rThe Rohsm STR series is a small racer built for clubs by Rohsm S.p.M., a hundred-year-old company headquartered in the Mediterranean racing culture of Tohs. Its most recent variant, the 750, is available in limited quantities to enthusiast owners and club pools. Like most petrol cars in Vekllei, they are built by hand, so no two 750s drive exactly alike.\nCompared to its neighbouring continents, petrol cars are criminally unsafe in Vekllei, where a preference for speed and lightweight manoeuvrability in European bodies see much of the steel of electric autos traded for light alloys and carbon. They crumple like drink cans in a crash, but prior to their death the driver is having the best driving experience of his life. This reckless pursuit of good driving means locals call them ‚Äúbastard cars‚Äù. Extraordinarily lightweight and tremendously powerful, they cut sharp racing lines and trace corners. Poised and nimble, they make good use of Motorway One, the gentle curved ring road of Vekllei with no speed limit.\nBecause of the inconvenience of finding petrol stations and their relative danger, not many people drive petrol cars in Vekllei. Why would you, when it is usually faster and more convenient to take a fast tram or train, or a battery auto from an autopool? The ones that do drive, however, drive hard.\n Pictured is the 25th STR-750, returned home after wins on the circuit in Italy and Spain. Her drivers are pictured above. It also happens to be Tzipora‚Äôs favourite car, because it was the first petrol car she ever drove.\n  Mittens and Metaphysic: Product Atheism and Vekllei object-form\r#\r\rüìñ Published 11th October 2020 | Read here.\n\r Pictured above: various fashions worn by Vekllei women, showcasing heavy cold-weather dresses, simple styling, strong geometric shapes and colours, loose fits, and modest hemlines.\n  Pictured below: postmodern neomarxism, which I‚Äôve tricked you into reading with anime.\n Previous posts on the Vekllei economy, if you‚Äôre new:\n \rSundress Municipalism and how it works \rMacroeconomics and currency in a country with no money  Vekllei‚Äôs obvious contradictions are commonly referenced, but not always clear. Why are parts of Vekllei epistemology, or the ‚ÄòVekllei way of thinking,‚Äô contradictory? And if these are contradictions, then surely they must fall apart when they‚Äôre examined? How is it possible to hold two contradictory ideas at the same time and apply them? Let‚Äôs look at Product Atheism, Vekllei‚Äôs foundation for necroeconomics.\nAtismoprodarte, lit. ‚Äúproduct atheism,‚Äù is the process by which Vekllei culture breaks down and rebuilds social preconceptions of objects, including products. Vekllei does not really have commodities in the traditional idea of the word, so it is supplemented here by ‚Äòproduct,‚Äô which more closely resembles the Vekllei word for commodity-forms: prodart or prodatte. This concept is a part of Upen, which is found throughout Vekllei culture and its constitution, and coexists agnostically with organised religion.\n‚ÄúProduct Atheism‚Äù is the term for how Vekllei people think about the objects that make up their lives ‚Äî clothes, appliances, toys, trinkets and treasures. These things are not quite commodities, because they are not ‚Äúsold‚Äù. Vekllei does not use money, and so it does not produce items of any economic value.\nAn object‚Äôs economic form, then, is replaced by social form. Among Marxists, they call these social forms fetishistic, because products are given lives of their own and exist independently of the labour that created them. But this doesn‚Äôt work in Vekllei, because\n‚Ä¢ Labour-value is social, not economic. Vekllei people are not paid for work and they do not pay money for products. All work is for social reasons; all consumption is for social needs. Any object that is prohibited from the ordinary Vekllei person is merely landscape; it has no form.\n‚Ä¢ Labour-value is simultaneously suppressed, in imitation of commodity, and celebrated, in imitation of dereification. Vekllei shops look like any foreign shops, because they participate in the same fantasy ritual of shopping and allow easy access to products. At the same time, Upen emphasises the importance of local consumption and objects made by hand, and so Vekllei appliances are generally hand-made. This creates a social bond between the producer and consumer, and breaks down commodity-form, but it can‚Äôt escape the fetishised valuations encouraged by the consumer-fantasy. So it is neither a social or economic product while being both; resulting in a permanent contradiction.\nIn fact, Vekllei ‚ÄòProduct Atheism‚Äô is more or less a rejection of Marxist commodity fetishism, and instead advocates product-worship. This is because objects in Vekllei are regarded as fantasy, and are eroticised by a fantasy market. This is a symptom of the unspoken truth most foreigners are well aware of ‚Äî Vekllei does not have an economy; the Vekllei economy is dead; the economy has been reanimated and is zombified. No money changes hands, no product has value, and all products are abstracted and exclusively physical simultaneously.\nThus Product Atheism has two contradictions; first, that the participatory market economy of Vekllei is both alive and dead, making it both undead and unaliave, and second, that products are both abstracted by Product Atheism and then unabstracted through Product Atheism at the same time, leaving them formless and unconstructed ‚Äî and, per Upen‚Äôs definitions, truly personal and intimate.\nAcknowledging this necroeconomic construction destroys it, and so a final truth is revealed. In Vekllei, the exchange of objects is a social formality, like their uniforms and sign-language, and is both entirely superfluous and essential to the functioning of the state. This is not Marxism; this is not even economic; this is Vekllei, and its cultural forms are what determine all constructions of society. Vekllei‚Äôs ‚Äòmaterial form‚Äô is actually cultural, and Upen is its culture.\nSince Vekllei economic forms are not truly economic, it makes sense that Product Atheism does not merely apply to the economy. All products, or objects, are part of its frameworks. The example used in this picture, depicting women‚Äôs fashion, is a good example of how Upen brings together an abstract object value and a valueless physical object simultaneously. Clothes in Vekllei have a very powerful social function, enhanced by how colour and shape become forms of communication in themselves as part of Vekllei semaphore. Clothes are both figuratively and literally signifiers of personality and individual expression.\nIn Vekllei written script, called Topet, most traditional clothing items are each assigned a single character, giving them a transcendental pictographic quality, a feature impossible to replicate in phonetic speech. In this sense, the written description of a dress in Vekllei supersedes its spoken equivalent, privileging pictorial, transcendental imagery over literalism. This poetic form is part of product-worship, and thus part of Product Atheism. This means that, without even touching the sociological tastes and trends of clothing fashion in Vekllei, we can see Product Atheism smashing Western frameworks against their own assumptions, leaving much of Vekllei epistemology, even today, incomprehensible to ideology without Upen as its framework.\n Atlantic Boredom [07.10.2020]\r#\r\rüìñ Published 7th October 2020 | Read here.\n\rFor a brief period of time, Zelda and Cobian took it upon themselves to make something of their youth. Cobian fancied herself a gymnast, and though this ambition arrived too late and left too soon, she was quite good at it for a while. Tzipora was better suited on the trampoline, where her stiff leg didn‚Äôt give her as much trouble.\nThey trained for about two hours, and after practice they met up to travel home together. Their gymnasium was in a coastal town called Gigayeh, in the borough of Mirah. Here, sloping lava fields were cast in the sea, buried under fine black sand.\nThere was an hour and a half after practice before the evening train arrived to take them back home to Lola, and so they were left with not much to do. Gigayeh had beautiful empty beaches, littered with icebergs that caught the light like jewels, but Tzipora couldn‚Äôt swim and the water was freezing. They could have enjoyed caf√© food in the sun, but Cobian‚Äôs regimented home life had left her incapable of eating outside of her designated meals, and Tzipora could only drink so much coffee. Instead, most of these afternoons, they found themselves sitting on the ocean promenade, watching a handful of locals go about their business as they counted the minutes.\nIn the moment, it was stupefyingly boring. They‚Äôd spent all day at school with each other and usually couldn‚Äôt conjure a word between them. Tzipora would make a remark about a seabird, because she liked them. She had been learning a lot about birds. Sometimes they would share a comic, but they read too fast to fill time. Most of it was spent in the sea air, feeling it grow colder as the day waned, watching the same ocean foam throw itself onto glittering volcanic sand.\n‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs a horned puffin. That‚Äôs special,‚Äù Tzipora said out loud. Cobian didn‚Äôt even look up. Tzipora squinted.\n‚ÄúNo, wait, that‚Äôs just a regular one.‚Äù\nIn time, Tzipora would remember this period of her life fondly, and would visit Gigayeh to recapture that peace. As a teen-ager, however, those afternoons seemed to last forever.\n VI. Gallery\r#\r\rThis month‚Äôs sketches, presented without context or or standards of quality.

As it turns out, it\u0026rsquo;s something like Inuktitut blended with French, pronounced by an Australian. This article introduces key Vekllei languages.\r\r‚≠ê Starred Article\nThis article is complete. It was last updated in November 2020.\r\rüìÉ Language in Vekllei\r#\r\r1. üìÑ Introduction\r#\r\rVekllei language, abbreviated to just Vekllei, has six core sublanguages that are used commonly today. Although they often intersect, these different systems of communication are distinct languages in their own right, used for different purposes in different arenas of communication.\nLanguage Systems in Vekllei\r Spoken Vekllei, which is everyday spoken language. It draws from two glossaries with different meanings and feelings, called Oa and Loh. Topet, which are logographic characters (occasionally characterised as hieroglyphs). Like other pictographic languages, Topet characters can be broken down into repeating components, called Topotte. Rapotenne, is the traditional logographic language of names. It is much older than Topet, and has more in common with spiritual runes than modern logography. Potenne, lit. ‚ÄúHand-Talk‚Äù, is a sign language that incorporates gestures and signing to add meaning to emotion to spoken language, and occasionally in place of it. Upotenne, lit. ‚ÄúSpirit-Hand-Talk‚Äù, as the recreation of runes in human form, used limitedly in spiritual ritual. Vekllei Semaphore is the codification of colour and shape. Traditionally limited to colour, shape and pattern are now also included in Vekllei Semaphore, in which full sentences can be formed.  \r\r2. üìë Language\r#\r\rLet\u0026rsquo;s take a look in more detail about how each aspect of the Vekllei language operates in daily life. With six recognised language, Vekllei is unique in its complexity and multidimensionality, appropriating a variety of scripts, glossaries, alphabets and physical components. Literacy in the country is very high, and Spoken Vekllei and Topet are understood universally. Other languages, often called sub-languages, are informed regionally and have varying literacy across the Home Island. For example, Upotenne is employed frequently in rural and agrarian communities, where religious ritual requires its frequent practice. This passage introduces the broad characteristics of each sub-language, which together form contemporary Vekllei, one of the world\u0026rsquo;s most complex and hermetic language systems.\n 2.1 üí¨ Spoken Vekllei\r#\r\rSpoken Vekllei, simply referred to as Vekllei domestically, is the common spoken language of Vekllei and official language of the country, spoken by some 25 million people worldwide, with 98% of speakers living natively in the Vekllei Home Islands. It is the first spoken language of the vast majority of the population, and has minor variance across the disparate Vekllei Home Islands and other Vekllei possessions. It is rarely spoken outside of Vekllei territories, extant only through emigrant populations and small diasporic communities mostly dispersed after the Atomic War.\n2.2.1 Overview\r#\r\rContemporary spoken Vekllei is largely descended from Proto-Islandi speech that arrived with the first Danish settlers in the country, but includes Kalaallisut and Proto-Algic reconstructions of an early extinct language called Kala. Modern spoken Vekllei has heritage in the combined, largely extinct language hybrid of Algic-Aleutian Quutetast and the Indo-European Islandi, which by the 9th century had fused into common speech usually called Topyas, or \u0026lsquo;Old Speech\u0026rsquo;/\u0026lsquo;Old Vekllei\u0026rsquo;. Modern Vekllei has evolved distinctively since the Atomic War as part of broader sociological trends towards informalised speech and cultivated Loh vocabularies.\n2.2.2 Twin Glossaries\r#\r\rSpoken Vekllei draws from two glossaries, called Oa and Loh. These glossaries date back to twin reconstructed Algic-Aleutian languages called Quutetast and Islandi that had been present in earlier forms since at least 1200BC. The glossaries were formalised in pagan ritual that would become present-day Upen, and later recognised as the official language of the country in the reformation initiated by Queen Souisviasn in the 3rd century.\n  Oa (lit. Sun)\r#\r\rOa is considered to have \u0026lsquo;permanent\u0026rsquo; traits. It is often characterised abroad as a positive glossary, though this is not true \u0026ndash; it is in fact dedicated to inanimate and unliving organs. It is gendered as masculine, and is associated with Summer and Spring.  Loh (lit. Moon)\r#\r\rLoh is considered to have \u0026lsquo;cyclical\u0026rsquo; traits. Loh words are largely derived from Old Vekllei (including Icelandic), and so its glossary is considerably less defined and dependent on older linguistic artefacts. Loh words It is gendered as feminine, and is associated with winter and autumn.  In modernity, this binary produces bizarre psycholinguistic quirks. For example, a sailing vessel (Siv) is derived from the Oa, historically because the Oa glossary was favoured for machines between the 10th and 16th Centuries. This genders all modern oceangoing vessels as male figures to this day, and due to Siv\u0026rsquo;s linguistic derivatives, ties ships permanently to the lumber and woodlands critical to wooden shipbuilding. From the 20th century onwards, however, most vehicles are regarded impermanent through Loh, and so all cars in Vekllei are female.\n2.2.3 Phonology\r#\r\rSpoken Vekllei is phonologically homogenous, and has little variation in accent or pronunciation across the Home Island or its various possessions, although there is some evidence for differences in dialect between cultivated speech on the coast and rural phonology in the interior of the Home Islands.\nMonophthongs\r#\r\rPure vowels in Vekllei are characterised by their lax, non-rhotic sound, and their uses vary across cultivated and common Vekllei dialects.\nPure Vowels\r    Front   Central  Back       Short Long Long (rounded) Short Long Short Long   Close …™ iÀê y   âÀê  ä    Close-Mid   √∏       Mid e eÀê  …ô …úÀê …î oÀê   Open-Mid   ≈ì       Open √¶ (√¶Àê)  …ê …êÀê      \r\rDiphthongs\r#\r\rFrom foundational monophthongs, gliding or diphthong vowels are often determined by glossary. Oa typically favours modernised post-Quutetast glides for its so-called Ocean Vowels, which are generally long and unrounded.

Topet incorporates logographic and neosyllabic/abugida-type components and has some 3,450 unique characters in modern usage. Although proto-glyphs and a primitive runic system had been used in Islandi-era Vekllei since at least the 8th Century BC, by the time Quutetast influences had arrived with Inuit settlement in the 4th Century AD the parent scripts had at least partially fused into early Topet, called Hieyeric. In Vekllei, Topet is the national language alongside its sister-form, Rapotenne and Spoken Vekllei. Topet has no clear lineage from Scandinavian or Inuit languages, and so is rarely understood outside of the territories where it is an official or significant minority language, which represents some 25 million people.\n2.2.1 Overview\r#\r\rIndividual Topet characters are both phonograms and semagrams, and so they support multiple readings. Many are basically figurative, and represent conceptually what they depict. Each character conforms to an abugida-type system, in which consonant-vowel pairings are written in joined notation. In Topet, the consonant anchors the pairing, which is called Lohtopet, and vowel notation is usually raised in superscript, called Oatopet. These names are not related to the binary glossary, but do represent the upper/lower system those glossaries imply. \u0026ldquo;Oa\u0026rdquo; means affirmative in Vekllei, and Loh is a negating confirmation, so their use is widespread beyond the binary glossary system.\n2.2.2 Phonetic Reading\r#\r\rConsonant characters (demioette, as opposed to vowels, or hieyerette1) written in Topet may feature redundant adjacent characters called phonetic complements, which, in a non-determinative reading, are pronounced the same way, to guide the reader. This lends to a system that encourages adjacent consonants in some aspects, since Vekllei characters are already combined into neosyllabic pairings and it is immediately obvious which characters are to be read. The word for friend, comoyia, can thus sometimes be transliterated into c-c-com-moyia, which can affect the conceptual meanings of a word through the figurative placement of its characters as well as help guide the reader through the use of multiple phonetically identical, though visually distinct, characters.\nIn the above case, comoyia can be affected by the composition of its phonetic complements, if any are used at all. There is a default reading, which combines both semantic and phonetic readings for meaning and is generally recognised as the dictionary \u0026lsquo;spelling\u0026rsquo; of the word, but this can be manipulated through the addition of semantically different, but identically phonetic characters to shade and change meaning. The word for an untrustworthy friend is also comoyia, but combines the characters for snake with the dictionary spelling, which produces a transliteration similar to c-comoyia. In spoken Vekllei, this distinction is only communicable through the aid of Potenne, and represents one of its primary uses.\n2.2.3 Semantic Reading\r#\r\rMany Topet characters are figurative; they represent their meanings pictographically, like Egyptian Hieroglyphs or Chinese Hanzi. In Vekllei, this is considered an evolved rune-form, and ties into a broader conceptualisation of language as a transcendental, rather than literal system. Although Topet\u0026rsquo;s early form, Hieyeric was explicitly pictographic, modern Topet is often abstracted and decoupled from its figurative meaning via the phonetic system.\nDespite common use of the phonetic system in modernity, the semantic readings of characters are taught and essential for literacy beyond literal imitation of speech. For the vast majority of Topet characters, their logographic meaning determines their pronunciation, and consonant characters especially depend on this meaning to form words. The word for breakfast is petimourgeneur, but it cannot be written with random literal phonetic characters; parts of the word depend on the figurative meaning of certain components, and so without its semantic traits the word would be illegible to most people. This represents a wider co-dependency on simultaneous phonetic and semantic readings of words, with the importance of each fluctuating depending on the word in question. Older words tend to be heavily figurative, whereas modern and loan words are often more phonetic. This inconsistency is part of the difficulty in learning Topet, and leaves many immigrants fluent in speech but inadequately literate in reading and writing.\n 2.3 üîñ Rapotenne\r#\r\rRapotenne (lit. \u0026ldquo;Name-Talk\u0026rdquo;) is the Vekllei system of names, often considered in modernity to function as a distinct, though limited, language. Contemporary Rapotenne is informed by pictographic proto-Topet runes as well as elements of the extinct Kala language and subsequently Quutetast Algic components. Because Kala is extinct and Quutetast is a dead language, largely displaced by modern spoken Vekllei, Rapotenne is unique among Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s sublanguages for its direct lineage from proto-linguistic forms of early Vekllei history, some nearly 4,000 years old. Today it is used largely ceremonially, through ritual related to birth and Blood Names2.\n2.3.1 Overview\r#\r\rRapotenne has its origins in superstitious Islandi magical staves, sigils which evolved into battle names and honourifics, called Blood Names. The use of Blood Names varies across Vekllei history, but is still common across ancestral families today. In modern immigration, especially after the Atomic War and British occupation, Blood Names have been commonly adopted by new families as symbolic displacement of older bloodlines, largely for their fashionable association with royalty and heritage. Rapotenne today mostly employs older Floral Vowels, which themselves are likely evolutions of proto-Quutetast pronunciation associated with Kala. Rapotenne characters, also called Rapotenne, are closely associated with old runic Islandi sigils, and are purely figurative. Their use in modernity is largely instructional, and is used to determine and act out Upotenne signs, which is functionally adjacent to Rapotenne.\n2.3.2 Practice\r#\r\rRapotenne consists of 452 characters in common practice, although priests and regional dialects may employ upwards of a 1,000. Despite integration with the formal Vekllei language constellation, minor differences in pronunciation survive. For example, the Alveolar /sÕá/ is dropped before consonants in ordinary spoken Vekllei, making it rare in modern usage, but is voiced in Rapotenne. The shape and stroke order of characters determines the physicality of Upotenne, as their function within ritual is more or less the same. Although simplistic and literally figurative, Rapotenne is used extensively in religious script and poetry and remains an important cultural force within Vekllei.\n 2.4 ü§≤üèª Potenne\r#\r\rPotenne (lit. \u0026ldquo;Hand-Talk\u0026rdquo;) is an auxiliary sign language in Vekllei used commonly today as an aid or substitute for vocalised speech. It was originally a form of avoidance speech that arose in response to social taboos in Upen, but acquired broader use by the 16th century and is employed commonly today part of many conventions and customs within the Home Islands.\n2.4.1 Overview\r#\r\rHistoric social taboos in Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s dominant religion, Upen, prevented speech between people for a variety of reasons, including for marital, interfamilial, penal and ascetic considerations. Potenne first arose to avoid these taboos. During the first substantial immigration of Inuit-Kalaallisut peoples in the 4th century BC, proto-Potenne avoidance languages developed pragmatic pidgin forms to allow for trade and communication between settlers and the original Islandi population. This rapid expansion in use saw Potenne develop solidified cultural tenants, including phonologically distinct suprasegmental components like biouspotenne (lit. \u0026ldquo;Face-Talk\u0026rdquo;), which distinguishes facial expression from gestures in poetic, transcendental forms, and kiouyapotenne (lit. \u0026ldquo;Child-Talk\u0026rdquo;), which uses facial expressions to teach children individual signs.\nBy the 11th Century, Potenne is documented alongside other critical languages like Topet, and had demonstrated its saturation of Vekllei society in several sociological and cultural forms, including Upotenne, today considered an independent language system within Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s varied linguistic cultures.\nPotenne is used today as a casual substitute for simple speech and to communicate figurative meanings of words in Topet otherwise uncommunicable in conventional speech.\n2.4.2 Phonology\r#\r\rIt is important to remember that Potenne is not simply a reproduction of ordinary speech in physical form; it is a language that assists the spoken word. Many Vekllei words can be simplified by incorporating Potenne, which better mimics nonverbal components of Topet and helps provide emotion and context to otherwise ambiguous phrases. In other cases, it replaces speech entirely, often in quiet areas or out of respect in public transit. In this sense, Potenne retains a handful of the characteristics inherited from its origins as an avoidance language, but remains distinct from both spoken Vekllei and Topet in its capacity to link and colour both.\nLocation\r#\r\rMost Potenne is acted out just below the chest, in a casual resting position. Positional and place-based signs are performed at the right shoulder, and emotion is often acted out at or just below the chin. Regional traits and dialects are common, and Potenne is perhaps Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s most provincial and evolving language.\nMovement\r#\r\rUpen signs are generally simple, and practiced quickly and casually. The direction of the fore and ring fingers generally indicate subject, and the position of the thumb indicates tone ‚Äî an outstretched thumb is casual whereas a thumb tucked inwards appears formal. Common words use simple, single-handed signs, but complete sentences and more complex words almost always require the use of both hands.\nOrientation\r#\r\rCommunication in the your own voice is performed with the hand held horizontally with few exceptions. Quoting speech and reading is most often spoken with the hand held vertically, although this varies between dialects. Various orientations incorporate meaning, including casual affirmation and some emotions.\nHandshape\r#\r\rMost signs are communicated with an open palm, although fists, hooked fingers, clenched fingers and relaxation of fingers are also used in various ways. Most common Potenne words are characterised by their informal, almost lazy composition, and so\n 2.5 üëèüèª Upotenne\r#\r\rUpotenne (lit. \u0026ldquo;Spirit-Hand-Talk\u0026rdquo;) is the nonverbal sign language of religious ritual in Vekllei. Much as Potenne combines semantic and verbal forms to enhance communication, Upen appropriates the older pictographic Rapotenne script\n2.5.1 Overview\r#\r\r 2.6 üè≥Ô∏è Vekllei Semaphore\r#\r\r2.6.1 Overview\r#\r\rNotes\r#\r\r  Demioette and hieyerette meaning lit. \u0026ldquo;early lower\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;early higher\u0026rdquo; respectively. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Blood Names are traditional ancestral names carried along a mother\u0026rsquo;s genetic heritage.

Yes, it‚Äôs painfully self-concerned and a little painful to read back, but for newcomers to the project you might find some ‚Äúobvious truths‚Äù about Vekllei you have not yet encountered.\r\rüóº A Cashless Tokyo\r#\r\rHobart Phillips\r#\r\r\rI did not come to Tokyo to find a reference for the Petticoat Project, because utopia does not exist there for me. In fact, by nearly every Vekllei metric, Tokyo is positively dystopian ‚Äî a consumer paradise of the crushing, isolating modernity Vekllei is supposed to escape. And yet, marks of this city (and this country) are prevalent through Vekllei as a constructed country and my aesthetic as a writer and an artist. I can‚Äôt bring myself to love all of Japanese society, but I do love the country and its people. This intersection between traditional utopian world-building (along the lines of News from Nowhere or even the original Utopia) and the emotional, linear fragments of utopian storytelling which realise the cold encyclopaedia of a utopian world were the focus of my expedition to Japan. The premise of Vekllei society is at odds with so much of Japanese society ‚Äî yet the emotional, aesthetic culture of the country (what I call the ‚Äòcharacter‚Äô of utopianism) has influenced my media creation tremendously.\nAs a supplementary preface, I would like to note that it would be terrible of me to dismiss Japan as an oriental wonder of salarymen and neo-Zaibatsu. That approach has more in common with Frank Capra‚Äôs wartime propaganda piece Know Your Enemy: Japan than it does with real structural criticism. It is all too easy to dismiss the social and economic conditions of the country today as the natural inclination of a Japanese caricature ‚Äî a homogenous hive-mind of enormously productive and obedient people. This is of course a terrible attack on the proud and long-standing tradition of dissent and progressiveness in the country ‚Äî which is also home to one of the world‚Äôs largest opposition communist parties. It is a country of student mobilisation, protests and intense factionalism between the left and right-wing radicals1. It is important not to conflate the impersonal structures of a society with the orientalist idea of cultural predisposition.\nA love of Studio Ghibli films and a desire for material and emotional escapism is what drives my utopian world-building. Where co-founder Isao Takahata had a penchant for artful emotional realism and domestic drama, Hayao Miyazaki has found tremendous success in Japan and abroad with his fantastical stories rich with nostalgia and warmth. They have obvious recurring themes ‚Äî childhood, environmentalism, aircraft, etc., but it is no real secret (at least to media critics and Ghibli superfans) that these overt recurrences are symptomatic of more serious and grounded beliefs. In a fantastic analysis of My Neighbour Totoro, Phillip E. Wegner makes use of Kojin Karatani‚Äôs works (another great influence of mine) to illustrate Miyazaki‚Äôs uniquely Japanese pre-Meiji cross-generational nostalgia evident in the film.\n What Miyazaki presents us with in My Neighbor Totoro is a vision in which the classic \u0026ldquo;what if\u0026rdquo; question of the genre has been proposed: that is, what if the Meiji revolution did not happen? Moreover, since it is the dramatic and rapid modernization of the Meiji period that gives rise to the virulent imperialist nationalism and militarism that ultimately results in the Second World War, Miyazaki also offers in his film us a glimpse of a Japan in which the catastrophe of World War II did not occur2.\n Japan‚Äôs spectre of modernity is a recurring character in many of Miyazaki‚Äôs films, just as the villain of war revives itself time and time again ‚Äî from the steel production of Iron Town in Princess Mononoke to the death of the golden age of aviation in The Wind Rises. Karatani‚Äôs landmark work, Origins of Japanese Literature, makes clear that basic premises of modern society ‚Äî from children to history to nature ‚Äî are not immutable items atomised by scientific fact, but instead products of modern society that have not always existed3 pp.12-44, 113-135. Vekllei reflects this concept, at least superficially ‚Äî children are represented as independent agents desegregated from modern age-based schooling, nature is regarded as a fellow social organ, and work is largely self-satisfying and decommodified. These are things that are important to me and it makes sense enough that Vekllei reflects that.\nSimilarly, even supposedly less political Ghibli films like Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service carry powerful images of the ‚Äòspectre of modernity‚Äô. Regarding the climax of the film in which a zeppelin soars hopelessly out of control over a city, A.J. Rocca hauntingly writes:\n [We] find that this is not truly a witch‚Äôs story, but a ghost story. The ghost died in a fire on 6 May 1937, foreshadowing the fires of a war that would change the world forever. The ghost is called the Spirit of Freedom in the film, but its true name is LZ 129 Hindenburg, and it‚Äôs not the spirit of freedom but the ghost of modernity.4\n So the material manifestation of Japanese society for me‚Äî despite all the glory of her bright packaging and dense infrastructure ‚Äî is an aesthetic and satirical media culture that saturates the Petticoat Project. Vekllei is a \u0026lsquo;poor man‚Äôs Utopia\u0026rsquo;, inspired in part by my superficial understanding of a ‚Äòpoor man‚Äôs Japan'. Vekllei, like media representations of postwar Sh≈çwa Japan, has a shadow of pacifism and shame about it (that idea that \u0026lsquo;all politics is sexual pathology‚Äô occurs to me). These are deliberate aesthetic choices that reflect not landscape utopianism but character utopianism ‚Äî the real colour of a constructed world that acts out the structure of mean ideology and culture-constructs. These ill-defined images of utopian society, and a rejection of landscape world-building, are excellent vehicles for utopian writing. After all, it is sustained engagement with utopia that betrays the totality of it5. What fascinates me particularly about Miyazaki‚Äôs unique utopian instincts is his recurring premise is essentially nostalgic and escapist ‚Äî the aesthetic of a Miyazaki film is almost always midcentury or earlier, illustrating a time before Japan‚Äôs ‚Äòmodern century‚Äô. This is in stark contrast to the saccharine optimism of utopian socialists like Morris, Chernyshevsky, and Bellemy, telling stories of a future yet to come.\nAnd that is to say nothing of the aesthetic qualities of a Japanese city! Tokyo is a wonderful glimpse of a retro-future as imagined by the 1980s ‚Äî as though the economic crisis of the 1990s has since suspended time. Japan is clean and modern, but also retrofuturistic. The lifeblood of the city is in rebar and concrete as infrastructure. The people on the street are dressed in conservative items that go without the prudish connotations of similar Western fashion. Working men and women are suited traditionally, many with waistcoats. Such is the visual language of modern Japan. Young men sport tech-wear or innovative types of street-wear dominated by colour and comfort. General women‚Äôs fashion leans heavily on items popularly discarded in Western markets, at least until recently. Pleat or patterned skirts, blouses, cardigans, hosiery and socks, loafers and brogues, etc. are very common and provide a wonderful anecdotal rebuff to the outrageous images of ‚ÄòHarajuku girls‚Äô and Lolita style that epitomise some ideas of Japanese fashion. The famous ‚Äòsailor uniform‚Äô has been largely phased out of junior and senior high schooling, replaced with Western-style blazers and ties. Tokyo is not ‚Äòbehind‚Äô the rest of the world; that is not what it means to be retrofuturistic. In my eyes, it has disembarked from Western technological and fashion attitudes some time ago and has since progressed on its own collective cultural intuition, and has subsequently spent the last few decades exporting media, fashion and culture into the West. It‚Äôs a great thing to see in person, at the heart of it all.\nDespite my qualms with modern Japanese consumer society, Vekllei is perched on a romanticised and fictitious Japanese aesthetic, and the country is enormously influential on the way I go about world-construction. With one sentence I will denounce the complexity of Japanese honorific language systems and in the other fawn over the mixed agricultural-residential suburbs that make up so much of the land outside of Tokyo‚Äôs city limits. Koka parks were inspired by these displays of community food production. The Vekllei Constabulary were created after research and experience with the Japanese Police Box system. Vekllei‚Äôs knotted network of trains and streetcars are reminiscent of Tokyo and Hiroshima. For all my public rejection of modern consumer society, and my begrudging participation in it, the Japanese qualities of Vekllei are valuable and are utopian in their own right ‚Äî and so Tokyo remains one of the most important inspirations of Petticoat Society in the world.\nSo what of that dichotomy? Of deep ideological incongruities with Japanese consumer society, but an embarrassing affection for the mythological post-war aesthetic and Japanese culture? The truth of it is that Vekllei is first and foremost a collection of stories, and stories are the domain of the emotional. Wonderful, vague images of utopia ‚Äî like washing corn in My Neighbour Totoro or an all-night writing session in Whisper of the Heart. My time in Tokyo introduced me to a wealth of these nostalgic feelings ‚Äî of curiosity in a cauldron of social atomisation. Life in Tokyo is not without problems, and it is certainly not my perfect idea of utopia, but the intersection of the culture and promise of Japanese society, either in the past as alt-history or in the future as science fiction, has me coming back time and time again to better realise my own projects of utopia.

You can read it here.\r\r\r My nerves are like overused sandpaper‚Äîall dull; only the eye-catching, bizarre and grotesque can excite me now.\n Tanizaki JunichiroÃÑ, 1918\nThe wind had died and it seemed that she would follow it. Crazy shadows distorted beneath car headlights. It occurred to her in some way that, as she approached dying, she was living out the ultimate dramatic fantasy of the American misplaced girl, in the same way the townsmen were fulfilling their grotesque constellation of death by murdering women. To them, she was not Zelda, or an agitator, or even a maid from Motel Grande; she was just a girl of girl-form, washed out; beat in; bent before the death-bridge where the creek rolled on below. It was brutal and violent, and also the most tacky thing. It scaled up and down, because it was murdering.\nThe hearts of America are like overused sandpaper ‚Äî all dull. This is how it played out in 2063, ages into the Great American Decline and well before it was put down like a sick dog by Chinese methods. The worn out bodies of the hedonistic coasts were numb to the spectacle of collapse and found themselves displaced and unfeeling, and so the neurotic motions of vampiric culture barons responded. In 2036, long before the Dallas Secession or Zelda‚Äôs birthday, the NBC under the Radio Corporation of America broadcast the first televised execution in the United States of child serial killer Wayne Graham. This enticed similar coverage across all major television networks for subsequent executions, which were viewed by millions of Americans. The format culminated in NBC‚Äôs The American Justice Show programme, in which the method and subject of broadcasted executions were made participatory by public poll. It was tremendously successful but was cancelled in 2041, after the botched death of George Kovacs.\nThis is not necrotic; this is neurotic; it is the ultimate sucking up of human desire into the commodity-form, and it was only the beginning. It is not just a poetic coincidence that the cancellation of American Justice saw the legalisation (or at the very least, decriminalisation) of prostitution in all regions but the Deep South over the next decade (which would contribute to the eventual secession). This is pleasure in its raw form, and the murder of prostituted immigrant-labourers and the eroticisation of the death of Wayne Graham‚Äôs teen-age victims was one and the same. The necroticisation would arrive later, as modernity tumoured and pleasure outpaced the sovereignty of the federal government.\nHere was Zelda, who was a perfect caricature of the real American in the 21st century ‚Äî born overseas, poor as shit, and dressed up for dying. And why shouldn‚Äôt she die? All the old things were dead. God, kings, outrage, empathy, optimism ‚Äî it was all thrown in the creek, with the rest of the immigrant-labourers. Why shouldn‚Äôt a child and her sensitivity be among them? You could change the channel on television and see pornography and the brutal violence of the Secession adjacent to each other. If you clicked the knob back and forth fast enough, they could become one and the same.\nTzipora was the last to arrive and among the first to be lynched, and maybe they would make postcards out of her dead body. She couldn‚Äôt even wonder this in her terror; the thought would only occur to her much later. It seemed like the whole Great American Decline, in all its hungry decomposition and hedonism was leading to this single moment ‚Äî and all that was once solid melts into Zelda.\n"});index.add({'id':32,'href':'/posts/2020-10-13-rohsm/','title':"Petrol Heaven ‚Äî The Rohsm STR-750",'section':"Archive",'content':"\rArchived from the original article here\r\rüåº Featured in the Atlantic\nThis article appeared in Issue #6 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.\r\r\rThe Rohsm STR series is a small racer built for clubs by Rohsm S.p.M., a hundred-year-old company headquartered in the Mediterranean racing culture of Tohs. Its most recent variant, the 750, is available in limited quantities to enthusiast owners and club pools. Like most petrol cars in Vekllei, they are built by hand, so no two 750s drive exactly alike.\nCompared to its neighbouring continents, petrol cars are criminally unsafe in Vekllei, where a preference for speed and lightweight manoeuvrability in European bodies see much of the steel of electric autos traded for light alloys and carbon. They crumple like drink cans in a crash, but prior to their death the driver is having the best driving experience of his life. This reckless pursuit of good driving means locals call them ‚Äúbastard cars‚Äù. Extraordinarily lightweight and tremendously powerful, they cut sharp racing lines and trace corners. Poised and nimble, they make good use of Motorway One, the gentle curved ring road of Vekllei with no speed limit.\nBecause of the inconvenience of finding petrol stations and their relative danger, not many people drive petrol cars in Vekllei. Why would you, when it is usually faster and more convenient to take a fast tram or train, or a battery auto from an autopool? The ones that do drive, however, drive hard.\n Pictured is the 25th STR-750, returned home after wins on the circuit in Italy and Spain. Her drivers are pictured above.

You can read it here.\r\r\r Pictured above: various fashions worn by Vekllei women, showcasing heavy cold-weather dresses, simple styling, strong geometric shapes and colours, loose fits, and modest hemlines.\n  Pictured below: postmodern neomarxism, which I‚Äôve tricked you into reading with anime.\n Previous posts on the Vekllei economy, if you‚Äôre new:\n \rSundress Municipalism and how it works \rMacroeconomics and currency in a country with no money  Vekllei‚Äôs obvious contradictions are commonly referenced, but not always clear. Why are parts of Vekllei epistemology, or the ‚ÄòVekllei way of thinking,‚Äô contradictory? And if these are contradictions, then surely they must fall apart when they‚Äôre examined? How is it possible to hold two contradictory ideas at the same time and apply them? Let‚Äôs look at Product Atheism, Vekllei‚Äôs foundation for necroeconomics.\nAtismoprodarte, lit. ‚Äúproduct atheism,‚Äù is the process by which Vekllei culture breaks down and rebuilds social preconceptions of objects, including products. Vekllei does not really have commodities in the traditional idea of the word, so it is supplemented here by ‚Äòproduct,‚Äô which more closely resembles the Vekllei word for commodity-forms: prodart or prodatte. This concept is a part of Upen, which is found throughout Vekllei culture and its constitution, and coexists agnostically with organised religion.\n‚ÄúProduct Atheism‚Äù is the term for how Vekllei people think about the objects that make up their lives ‚Äî clothes, appliances, toys, trinkets and treasures. These things are not quite commodities, because they are not ‚Äúsold‚Äù. Vekllei does not use money, and so it does not produce items of any economic value.\nAn object‚Äôs economic form, then, is replaced by social form. Among Marxists, they call these social forms fetishistic, because products are given lives of their own and exist independently of the labour that created them. But this doesn‚Äôt work in Vekllei, because\n‚Ä¢ Labour-value is social, not economic. Vekllei people are not paid for work and they do not pay money for products. All work is for social reasons; all consumption is for social needs. Any object that is prohibited from the ordinary Vekllei person is merely landscape; it has no form.\n‚Ä¢ Labour-value is simultaneously suppressed, in imitation of commodity, and celebrated, in imitation of dereification. Vekllei shops look like any foreign shops, because they participate in the same fantasy ritual of shopping and allow easy access to products. At the same time, Upen emphasises the importance of local consumption and objects made by hand, and so Vekllei appliances are generally hand-made. This creates a social bond between the producer and consumer, and breaks down commodity-form, but it can‚Äôt escape the fetishised valuations encouraged by the consumer-fantasy. So it is neither a social or economic product while being both; resulting in a permanent contradiction.\nIn fact, Vekllei ‚ÄòProduct Atheism‚Äô is more or less a rejection of Marxist commodity fetishism, and instead advocates product-worship. This is because objects in Vekllei are regarded as fantasy, and are eroticised by a fantasy market. This is a symptom of the unspoken truth most foreigners are well aware of ‚Äî Vekllei does not have an economy; the Vekllei economy is dead; the economy has been reanimated and is zombified. No money changes hands, no product has value, and all products are abstracted and exclusively physical simultaneously.\nThus Product Atheism has two contradictions; first, that the participatory market economy of Vekllei is both alive and dead, making it both undead and unaliave, and second, that products are both abstracted by Product Atheism and then unabstracted through Product Atheism at the same time, leaving them formless and unconstructed ‚Äî and, per Upen‚Äôs definitions, truly personal and intimate.\nAcknowledging this necroeconomic construction destroys it, and so a final truth is revealed. In Vekllei, the exchange of objects is a social formality, like their uniforms and sign-language, and is both entirely superfluous and essential to the functioning of the state. This is not Marxism; this is not even economic; this is Vekllei, and its cultural forms are what determine all constructions of society. Vekllei‚Äôs ‚Äòmaterial form‚Äô is actually cultural, and Upen is its culture.\nSince Vekllei economic forms are not truly economic, it makes sense that Product Atheism does not merely apply to the economy. All products, or objects, are part of its frameworks. The example used in this picture, depicting women‚Äôs fashion, is a good example of how Upen brings together an abstract object value and a valueless physical object simultaneously. Clothes in Vekllei have a very powerful social function, enhanced by how colour and shape become forms of communication in themselves as part of Vekllei semaphore. Clothes are both figuratively and literally signifiers of personality and individual expression.\nIn Vekllei written script, called Topet, most traditional clothing items are each assigned a single character, giving them a transcendental pictographic quality, a feature impossible to replicate in phonetic speech. In this sense, the written description of a dress in Vekllei supersedes its spoken equivalent, privileging pictorial, transcendental imagery over literalism. This poetic form is part of product-worship, and thus part of Product Atheism. This means that, without even touching the sociological tastes and trends of clothing fashion in Vekllei, we can see Product Atheism smashing Western frameworks against their own assumptions, leaving much of Vekllei epistemology, even today, incomprehensible to ideology without Upen as its framework.\n"});index.add({'id':34,'href':'/posts/2020-10-07-boredom/','title':"Atlantic Boredom",'section':"Archive",'content':"\rArchived from the original article here\r\rüåº Featured in the Atlantic\nThis article appeared in Issue #6 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.\r\r\rFor a brief period of time, Zelda and Cobian took it upon themselves to make something of their youth. Cobian fancied herself a gymnast, and though this ambition arrived too late and left too soon, she was quite good at it for a while. Tzipora was better suited on the trampoline, where her stiff leg didn‚Äôt give her as much trouble.\nThey trained for about two hours, and after practice they met up to travel home together. Their gymnasium was in a coastal town called Gigayeh, in the borough of Mirah. Here, sloping lava fields were cast in the sea, buried under fine black sand.\nThere was an hour and a half after practice before the evening train arrived to take them back home to Lola, and so they were left with not much to do. Gigayeh had beautiful empty beaches, littered with icebergs that caught the light like jewels, but Tzipora couldn‚Äôt swim and the water was freezing. They could have enjoyed caf√© food in the sun, but Cobian‚Äôs regimented home life had left her incapable of eating outside of her designated meals, and Tzipora could only drink so much coffee. Instead, most of these afternoons, they found themselves sitting on the ocean promenade, watching a handful of locals go about their business as they counted the minutes.\nIn the moment, it was stupefyingly boring. They‚Äôd spent all day at school with each other and usually couldn‚Äôt conjure a word between them. Tzipora would make a remark about a seabird, because she liked them. She had been learning a lot about birds. Sometimes they would share a comic, but they read too fast to fill time. Most of it was spent in the sea air, feeling it grow colder as the day waned, watching the same ocean foam throw itself onto glittering volcanic sand.\n‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs a horned puffin. That‚Äôs special,‚Äù Tzipora said out loud. Cobian didn‚Äôt even look up. Tzipora squinted.\n‚ÄúNo, wait, that‚Äôs just a regular one.‚Äù\nIn time, Tzipora would remember this period of her life fondly, and would visit Gigayeh to recapture that peace.

You can read it here.\r\r\rPeople are not sure what to make of Baron. They are not sure what to make of his daughter, Tzipora, either. To that end, they are lucky to have found each other.\nHis obscurity is part of a severe disposition, made obvious by his astonishing disinterest in friends and hobbies. When he finishes work, he listens to the radio, prepares supper, and goes to bed. His unrelenting seriousness is mitigated by his general passivity ‚Äî Baron is a man totally in control, who keeps to himself and does not take issue with what goes on around him. For his seriousness he is not particularly judgemental or opinionated. To call him boring would be a poor characterisation; he simply feels he has done enough and is not looking to complicate the basic equations of his life.\nTzipora (Zelda to him) complicates this equation. She‚Äôs similar to him in many ways, with her conservative personal disposition and humble lifestyle. She does not make a very good teen-ager.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs funny you say that. I was talking to her the other day, and she was talking about how nice it was to have some peace and quiet,‚Äù Baron once confided in Ayn. ‚ÄúOf course, she looks very young, so sometimes you have to remind yourself that she‚Äôs not a child. She‚Äôs not thirteen, she‚Äôs nineteen, and very unusual, I think. She‚Äôs very smart but she doesn‚Äôt let that on much.‚Äù\nTzipora did not really have ‚Äúphases‚Äù ‚Äî Tzipora was Tzipora, eternal. But she was a much more emotionally attuned person, and her highs were higher and her lowers were lower than anything Baron had felt in decades.\nHe was not always so unfeeling. Baron‚Äôs Ashkenazim parents were pulled straight from the bubbling diaspora of Eastern Europe. They met in the labour zionist movement, but fell out of love with professional organising and immigrated to a struggling Vekllei to work in the national hydroelectricity scheme, among thousands of immigrants employed by the Thunderburo.\nHe was born in 2027 and was not very interested in school as a child. He was rebellious and obstinate, and had only vague ambitions of acquiring a trade certificate in motorcycle repair. His sister, Amelie, died of tuberculosis when he was 11. That was about the end of school ambitions for him.\nHe started conscription early and spent his high school years in an army college. By the time he was 18, he was transferred to military police. It was 2045. He had started dating a middle school sweetheart, Ayn, two weeks before the war in Taiwan broke out.\nYoung Baron died in Taiwan, and another figure in his body returned. He was transferred almost immediately to a junior post at the Americas Bureau at National Intelligence (AB/NI), where he would spend the next decade. While he was stationed abroad, his mother died and his father followed. By this time, Baron was a significant asset for Vekllei‚Äôs deep autonomous intelligence work ‚Äî apolitical, unattached, unsentimental and steady on his feet. He was destined to die in Colombia, employed indefinitely and waiting to be used up. In 2063, he met a fellow Spanish-speaking Jew by name of Tzipora.\nIn many ways, his identity is as fractured as Tzipora‚Äôs, whose Jewish European ancestry was a novel curiosity and not much more. She considered herself a Latina-American until she was Vekllei, and since then she has not been anything more. That was how it went in Vekllei‚Äôs grand secular melting pot. Tzipora was still ta bubeleh to him, but by his mid-thirties Baron had lost most of his mother‚Äôs Yiddish. Tzipora is his closest friend and daughter at the same time. She is a wholly energetic and independent agent in his life, and their relationship alternates awkwardly but intuitively between father-daughter and old friends. Ayn wonders if it is not a coincidence that Tzipora looks like Amelie, his sister.\nThe two of them champion the redemption of losers; the adrift, empty people of the world, acting on a chance to salvage a life and family. Tzipora expected to die in America; Baron expected nothing at all. But when Christmas comes around, and Ayn visits for supper, Taiwan and America melt into air; and their apartment houses the only Jewish Christmas tree in the neighbourhood.\n"});index.add({'id':36,'href':'/posts/2020-09-27-intro/','title':"Little Bouncy Zelda ‚Äî an animation diary",'section':"Archive",'content':"\rArchived from the original article here\r\rüåº Featured in the Atlantic\nThis article appeared in Issue #5 of the Atlantic Bulletin.

In her last summer, she developed a desperate fascination with her receding childhood, and eventually took her own life outside of the classroom she‚Äôd studied in as a third-grade student.\nHer death deeply disturbed Tzipora, who was keenly aware of how sentimental people died against metrics of their own imagination. She wondered if the government architects who designed schools and universities considered how those spaces gave life to memories. They were filled with lunchtimes and puppy love and old friends and your parents ‚Äî and those things folded into brick and concrete and linoleum floors. Fifty years earlier, some architect designed a classroom so valuable that Maya took her own life in the memory of it.\nTheir Puffling troop had set off for a camp site two hours away. Tzipora and Zo did not walk with them. They followed the flower tundra north, near where Zo and Maya had played as kids. At the base of an old oak, shrouded in a cool mist, Zo buried a pair of plastic earrings and laced school shoes, neither of which had been worn in a long time. Zo started to cry. Tzipora gave her some time to herself. After a while they drank hot tea with their feet in the creek. The mist had closed them in. There was good reason why people travelled to flower-tundras to meet with the dead. The mirror-pools and tombstone drumlins invoked the spirits.\nAfter the tea, Zo pulled out her map and they set off again for the camp site, leaving the tree behind forever.\n"});index.add({'id':38,'href':'/posts/2020-09-17-gay/','title':"Cobian and Zelda \"head-over-heels\"",'section':"Archive",'content':"\rArchived from the original article here\r\rüåº Featured in the Atlantic\nThis article appeared in Issue #5 of the Atlantic Bulletin.

You can read it here.\r\r\rIn Vekllei, uniforms are prevalent across all levels of society. They are perhaps the most obvious example of the opaque contradictions at the heart of Vekllei life, caught between wholly opposing ideas: between tradition and progress; liberty and control; and, most crucially here ‚Äî between individualism and the burden of society.\nDepicted here are uniforms for education ‚Äî Tzipora as a puffling of the Puffin Scouts on the left, and the others in mere school uniforms. These uniforms are universal and used across all ages of schooling, from kindergarten to university. Even some teachers wear them ‚Äî it starts to stretch the conventional imagination about what constitutes a uniform.\nA few observations on this picture:\nFirst, these uniforms are used interchangeably across ages and disciplines. The difference between a red pleat skirt and a navy skirt is trivial; it is merely a difference in the meaning of the clothing, as part of Vekllei semaphore. They are both equally the school-mandated uniform of education, and can be worn interchangeably from one day to the next, in third grade and at university.\nSecond, there are many small uniquenesses in the uniform of each person, which are accentuated by their surrounding uniformity. Tzipora‚Äôs school shirt is pleated along the buttons, acquired off the rack of a department store. One pair of trousers might be a slightly different shade to the pair next to it. These discrepancies are not regarded as malfunctions of the uniform system, since the system is not designed to make each student conform to a single appearance ‚Äî it is about identity and convenience in a country that spent many decades clawing its way out of abject poverty.\nThese principles apply across many workplaces and in government, too ‚Äî where uniforms are not intended to only signify publicly a place of work but instead form social bonds through clothing, which are intimate factors of ordinary life. In Vekllei, clothes are not an expression of personality, but items to communicate and bond with, regulated not by an authority demanding strict conformity but a desire for identity, physicality, infrastructure and convenience.\nSuch a state of affairs is unimaginable in some countries, especially beyond collectivist or conformist cultures. Individualist intuition suggests that uniforms are actively detrimental to personal expression ‚Äî but this idea demands a scale of expression far beyond the preference for subtlety and delicateness in Upen. Deviations from uniformity, like earrings, the way hair is worn, wristwatches, makeup and minor irregularities accentuate the value of those things, and make them more important. This aesthetic contrast is at the heart of the wider Upen intuition that you can see in architecture and political priority alike. And, as any Vekllei boy will tell you ‚Äî seeing a classroom crush out of uniform for the first time is a religious experience, and only afforded by scarcity.\nVekllei is an individualist society, modelled after self-concern and self-love by a salt-of-the-earth and larrikin people of my native Australia. This is not a people compatible with conventional thinking on the regulation of appearance ‚Äî but, as with many things in Vekllei, both are held true at the same time. They are a free and unrestrained population clothed at work and in school in clothes gifted to them. As an addendum, although many readers find common ancestry with Japan in this project (not unreasonably, either), Vekllei has more in common in some ways with the distant neighbours of my Australian homeland ‚Äî countries that haven‚Äôt been glamorised in the West through culture export. Thailand, Cambodia and Laos are among them ‚Äî coincidentally, all three are rare examples of countries where university students wear uniforms.\nSomeday, we‚Äôll look at the aesthetics of power and authority-worship, inspired at least in part by the history and culture of these countries, and associate them with cultural forces in Vekllei. If you have any questions, just ask.\n"});index.add({'id':42,'href':'/posts/2020-08-31-grotesque/','title':"Absolute Grotesque",'section':"Archive",'content':"\rArchived from the original article here\r\rüåº Featured in the Atlantic\nThis article appeared in Issue #4 of the Atlantic Bulletin.

A jagged tear ran down the leg of her dark blue work trousers, but the white calf it revealed was miraculously unscathed. The woman lay still. Probably dead, I assumed.

Rumour had it that they could make a thousand yen in a single night. Now and then she would find herself holding the forty-sen paperweight she had bought after ten days of indecision when she was these girls‚Äô age, and as she studied the sweet little dog in relief, she would realise with a shock that there was not a single dog left in the whole burnt-out neighbourhood.\n From The Silver Fifty-Sen Pieces, by Kawabata Yasunari\nOn the 14th of August 2111, the Atomic War began in a Chinese submarine in the South Pacific, and ended six hours later. The war marks the single greatest loss of life in human history and would disrupt human life on Earth in previously unimaginable ways ‚Äî consumer society bottomed out, the world became small, the Earth grew cold, and a new chapter in human history was opened.\nThis political map marks the territories of Earth as they stand five years on, in 2116. There are fewer countries in the world today than in any other point in human history, in part because the catastrophic reduction in human population ‚Äî some 520-600 millions in the first year ‚Äî has emptied out countries and rendered others uninhabitable. Many of these territories here are disputed and, in some cases, autonomous ‚Äî for simplicity, they are presented as they are recognised by the U.N. The map also presents a long-exposure view of the war as it happened, and its remaining fallout currents today. Red dots mark significant nuclear detonations on August 14th. Yellow dots mark surface warfare in some capacity. Red trails mark missile flight, reduced in number here by strict denuclearisation treaties of the decades previous. Yellow trails mark the flight paths of atomic bombers, both supersonic and subsonic. This map does not record failed launches, intercepted missiles or downed aircraft.\nFighting was arranged along political axes ‚Äî namely Western (U.S., U.K., West Germany \u0026amp; N.A.T.O. members), Warsaw Pact (U.S.S.R., Cuba, Egypt), East Asian (China \u0026amp; Korea), and non-aligned (Vekllei, France, Brazil). The war experience was unique to each country ‚Äî Vekllei exchanged warheads and bombs with China but not Warsaw countries, the U.S.S.R. exchanged with both Western and East Asian members, and Brazil fought a catastrophic war against both Soviet and American territories. The immediate aftermath saw a quiet Earth, much of it scorched. Temperatures dropped by 10 degrees centigrade for the first six months, and slowly warmed as debris cleared in the following years. Wide-scale firestorms were tempered by rains that followed the war shortly.\nSome 274 millions of the dead are accounted for in China, where in 2116 the cities still lie in rot, swollen with corpses; heavy with miasma; concrete dams bleached and cracked; the wood all burned up; the rivers warped and quiet; dead fish along them; a surfaced water main weeping blood; harsh asbestine whistling; railcars in a ditch; sloughing skin; tremors; smoke with no fires; confused wandering; bleeding from the inside; families-as-sand; sand-as-trinitite.\nExchanges were confused, helter-skelter, and the combatants rattle off like a death snare. The U.S.S.R., the U.S., France, and Vekllei all exchanged death with China.\nIt would take more than mere annihilation to extinguish the P.R.C., but the toll was nauseating. Beijing and Shanghai were simply disappeared; there was nothing where there once was. The fistfuls of rebar and concrete amidst glassy, ossified landscape were heaped into direct administration of the U.N. The following year, 40-120 million more Chinese would succumb to the greatest famine in the history of the world. Of course, in the U.N., there was good argument for the nuclear retaliation ‚Äî China launched first; why should money and food go to the perpetrator of the vastest disaster in human history? One can‚Äôt help but wonder if the life of an Oriental coolie wells fewer tears than his equivalent in Paris. There are not enough flowers in the world to pay tribute to the dead of China, who were simply dispensed with in European memory and subsumed in part by the United Nations. The communist party would continue to control the vast interior, divided into two states by ethnography, where 1949 seemed closer than ever. Necrotic politics are legitimised in the land of the dead. Soon, we saw the consolidation of nation-states into geographic regions with a disregard for ethnography not seen since the colonial years. This was met with violent resistance in some places ‚Äî in others, locals capitulated to the extraordinary hyperreality of the postwar world.\nThe United Nations was quickly catapulted into the status of a de facto administrative world government in a last-ditch attempt to ‚Äòfreeze time‚Äô as it were, in order to provide the superpowers time to recover from the scope of immediate devastation and prevent humanity from entering a long period of decline. This involved the moving of soldiers on a scale unseen since the World Wars, as U.N. international brigades propped up vulnerable, scorched territories in Central/Western Europe and Asia. The immediate peace of the first days after the war was ruthlessly enforced ‚Äî and strategic opportunism was threatened to meet indiscriminate violence and U.N.-sanctioned nuclear retaliation. There was some belief that the status quo could carry on. So troops of non-combatant countries were supplied, and in some cases press-ganged, into this global mission.\nThe battered United States, acknowledging its ‚Äòcentury of decline‚Äô, found itself consolidating control over its urban, though devastated, coasts. The awkward appellation \u0026ldquo;Dallas America\u0026rdquo; was used as a colloquial shorthand for a disputed territory that insisted on referring to itself as the legitimate United States. The name was only superseded by the ridiculous \u0026ldquo;United Nations Heartlands of the United States,\u0026rdquo; the Aid Region of the U.S. interior that had collapsed in the days after the war. This was buffered by the Mojave and Great Lakes Special Administrative Regions, federal territories that contained war industry and nuclear infrastructure that propped up the precarious coasts. Despite efforts to revive agriculture in the scorched U.N. Heartlands U.S., starvation was met with martial law along the coasts the following year.\nThe U.N. was granted temporary, direct control over several collapsed territories that had either succumbed to nuclear fire or had caved to anarchy in the weeks and months after. In some cases, like the U.N. regions in Hawaii, Jerusalem and the Central Europe International War Government, these behaved as states in themselves, administrated directly by the United Nations Mission for War Recovery. In others, they were merely named as such with the vague promise of future aid. U.N. Cuba and U.N. Taiwan were such examples, in which devastation had been so catastrophic that little remained to govern, and the local population was mostly left to anarchy. In general, there were great inequalities in how the U.N. chose to dedicate resources, largely informed by its largest nation-states and political interests.\nThere are thousands of stories from communities and territories across the world directly impacted by the war ‚Äî from the atomic bombing of Sydney to the catastrophic reactor meltdowns of Brazil‚Äôs south. The war was unprecedented in scale and devastation. This map reveals little of the profoundly human tragedy that was brought about, nor does it invoke the difficult existential artefacts that are still being reckoned with. Perhaps humans are just animals after all ‚Äî destined to die out the way so many have in this age. Most tragic was not the colossal scale of death, or the collapse and pain that followed, but the upending of domestic society into violence, in which people of consumer society ‚Äî the middle class ‚Äî found themselves with not much at all, thrust into a world of chaos and suffering in which all prior epistemologies evaporated. Like the flash of blue light that preceded the roar, it was the stuff in supermarkets and department stores that marked the absolute grotesqueing of life in the new age.\n"});index.add({'id':43,'href':'/posts/2020-08-27-2000-members/','title':"2,000 members!

Passing seconds dislocated and caught heartbeats. The plumes were pretty. It was such a shame, those plumes.

You can read it here.\r\r\r\rNewda is Vekllei‚Äôs national architectural ideology, applied flexibly in a range of modernist styles developed domestically in her architecture schools. Broadly, Newda buildings emphasise distinction from the surrounding landscape (called Dumousiantopet, or ‚Äòbeautiful and seperate‚Äô), natural decay, and honesty in material and construction. Vekllei‚Äôs great Parliament House is Newda; as are the little rural homes found in the mountains inland in Vekllei.\nTzipora‚Äôs house in the village of Montre-Lola (\ras depicted on the map here) is built in what Vekllei calls ‚ÄúAzores revivalism‚Äù, a Newda style heavily influenced by the stripped deco and streamline moderne buildings of a century prior. It is part of a constant conversation Newda holds with its past, as both a deeply modernist, progressive school and one bound up in the wider aesthetic and cultural traditions of Upen, the spiritualism of Vekllei.\nHer house is small, but appears larger due to the layout of the structure. A small sleeping loft sits atop the living, bathing and cooking areas of the home, and opens out into a private rooftop garden. The utilities tower also hides a small staircase leading to the roof, which is also accessible for outdoor recreation. Her home stands amidst the farmland of Montre-Lola, and very near the library and primary school where she works. Her property is marked at its end by a creek that runs into the Dentre River. She has a vegetable garden in her backyard, and shares her paddocks with her neighbours for grazing periodically throughout the year.\nHer house was erected in gratitude by her neighbours out of prefab components, and assisted by a ‚Äúconstruction line,‚Äù ‚Äî a temporary rail line in which goods are delivered and cranes are supported, minimising the need for lorries. Houses of this type and period are rarely seen in agricultural settings in other countries, but in Vekllei, where Landscape has been abolished, there might as well be no difference between a building suitable for the cosmopolitan, coastal cities and a dwelling for a farmer-girl.\n"});index.add({'id':46,'href':'/posts/2020-08-12-ageless/','title':"The Thousand-Year-Old Girl",'section':"Archive",'content':"\rArchived from the original article here\r\rüåº Featured in the Atlantic\nThis article appeared in Issue #4 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.\r\r\rThe concept of living forever jumps out at people uncomfortable with their own existence. There is a contemplative instinct among educated people that ‚Äî if they could simply will themselves into a state of self-actualisation ‚Äî death would only be an obstacle to greatness.\nAs Tzipora found out quickly, the opposite was true ‚Äî death and temporality were wells of meaning against which all great people, beauty, and human constructions were cast.\nTzipora Desmoisnes is what is known as a Gregori Baby, a catch-all term for a unique genetic condition that has seemingly produced a variety of miracle children appropriate for the frothing futurism of the atomic age ‚Äî boys and girls who, suspended in the purity and good-naturedness of childhood ‚Äî live forever.\nThere is no single ‚ÄúGregori Baby‚Äù ‚Äî each is unique, and Tzipora is the 13th to have been recognised overall. The phrase is a shortening of Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome, a stand-in for medical information that isn‚Äôt there. The first, Gregori Hordiyenko, was born in 2024. He was healthy, and died of unrelated causes in his 20s. Tzipora, at 13th, continues to live to this day and is the oldest person on Earth.\nThere is a disturbing trend among the Gregori children, first heralded as miracles and symptoms of the space age, to deteriorate medically as more are born. The culprit is the malfunctioning of telomeres in their DNA ‚Äî the source of their longevity ‚Äî which regularly produce devastating chromosomal disorders, including Trisomy 13 \u0026amp; 18, killing most ‚Äúageless children‚Äù before their third birthday. Those that survive are often victims of a severe anaphylaxis caused by a hyperactive immune system ‚Äî rendering many of them permanently sickly. Others find themselves unageing, but continue to grow ‚Äî reaching as tall as 2.5m before their bodies give out from exhaustion and osteoporosis.\nSo what is Gregori syndrome? What does your average (healthy) Gregori baby look like? Their genetic miracle is linked to the structures of the body that activate at puberty, and so girls vary between 11-16 years of age at onset depending on many factors that affect their development. Boys tend to be a little younger, from 8-14. Between the two, girls tend to be more stable, and all but two of the supercentenarian Gregori children are female.\nAmong girls, they are prepubescent and generally stop ageing on the eve of menarche, or their first period. In Tzipora‚Äôs case, her body is estimated to be 13 years and 11 months old. Unlike many Gregori children, Tzipora lives in a wealthy country and has volunteered for extensive research into her genetic makeup, meaning that much of early medical documentation around Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome was received directly from her case.\nMost obvious is that, at a foundational level, her cells are similar in function to unipotent stem cells, and have been since hormones at the end of thelarche suspended her ageing. This change has occurred somewhere in her DNA ‚Äî exactly where is unknown ‚Äî but the end result is that, unlike regular progenitor cells that make up most adult bodies, the building blocks of her body are capable of cell-renewal. Her telomeres, the endcaps of chromosomal DNA in mammals, are undamaged. And so there is an amazing shift in her basic human structure ‚Äî in which human cell lineage, which usually ends in a mature cell incapable of division, is caught and rearranged. With this considered, it is no wonder that Gregori children suffer from such catastrophic chromosomal instability, and why healthy ageless babies are a rarity. Her body is not exactly a ‚Äúbody of stem cells,‚Äù but for their function in a healthy Gregori child, they might as well be.\nSo it is that nothing about Tzipora is changing. She suffers from pains in her legs often ‚Äî called growing pains, although they are not from growing ‚Äî and her cells continue to replenish, albeit at a rate 1.25 times that of normal people. She is, in essence, ‚Äúgrowing‚Äù as any other premenarchal girl would, but she is not getting bigger or becoming older.\nTzipora is blessed with an adult life in Vekllei, where the ‚ÄúChild‚Äù does not exist as it does in the West, and her individual freedoms are far-ranging. She may smoke, and drink, and has held many different jobs in her life. She holds two doctorates in English and Vekllei Literature. She is obviously sterile ‚Äî even if she were to somehow ‚Äúage out‚Äù of prepubescence into pubescence and receive the required hormones, she simply lacks the genetic code to reproduce ‚Äî but raises many children through her active participation in village life and her roles as Montre-Lola‚Äôs municipal and school librarian.\nIn other countries, with coded roles for children, their problems are much greater. Unable to form adult relationships and often incapable of finding work, many work in entertainment or fall into poverty as they outlive their friends and parents. Socially ostracised and forever young, many are victims of superstition and fear. As the pattern of Gregori children indicates an increase in mortality, even as more are born, their appearance is both a miracle and a tragedy ‚Äî ageing not through mitosis but through weathering the societies in which they live.\n"});index.add({'id':47,'href':'/posts/2020-08-09-spaceship/','title':"The 31st Century ‚Äî Vekllei throughout our Solar System",'section':"Archive",'content':"\rArchived from the original article here\r\rüåº Featured in the Atlantic\nThis article appeared in Issue #4 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.\r\r\rThe Epoch of Rest\r#\r\rWe‚Äôve spent a lot of time in the 21st century ‚Äî but Tzipora is biologically immortal. Where does she go from here? Well, let‚Äôs enjoy a small glimpse at that future together, by winding the clock forward one thousand years.\nBy 3076, our Solar System is a pleasant place to be. Most of the planets we once gazed at from afar are now habitable and lived on. The Great Epoch of Rest has begun.\nThere is no great interstellar empire, no rise and fall of spacefaring supernations ‚Äî a Vekllei way of life is now lived out in multicultural, prosperous clusters of people across our Solar System. The ordinary person is afforded incredible freedoms previously reserved for science fiction through the accessibility of personal light spacecraft, translated literally as ‚Äúboats‚Äù.\nThis here is the M-7000 APRICOT, manufactured by the Government Aerospace Factories (GAF) of Vekllei. Many companies are contracted by the GAF, including General Reactor S.A., to whom this boat lends most of its flight control systems and all of its power plant. It is a light, personal boat for women built in 2807, making it relatively unique in both its 28th century design language and its gendered marketing. While the personal boat market was growing rapidly by this time, the vast majority of owners and pilots were men. The APRICOT set out to change that, and Tzipora, the world‚Äôs oldest living person with a youthful face, was among the first to demonstrate the accessibility and freedoms of space travel for women and girls in the personal boat market. It was her first boat, and despite its orientation for women it was christened with a male name: BARON.\nIt is a comfortable and pleasant craft that can be lived in for extended periods of time. Tzipora has done just that, travelling to stars in search of water-planets with Micronesian archipelagos, where she likes to spend most of her time. Its glass roof across the entire accessible cabin, including bubbled cockpit, gives it breathtaking visibility in the depths of space and the most scenic of planets alike. Like almost all spacecraft, it is unarmed, save for the pacifying ‚Äújazz‚Äù electric canon, named for its firing sound reminiscent of a double bass strum.\nWhen she tires of being alone, she returns to her hometown of Montre-Lola in Vekllei frequently. Boats are usually parked at off-world stations, preserving the aerospace and quiet of the Solar System.\nLight speed is exceeded through superluminal travel. So-called black boxes require extraordinarily precise programming, since superluminal travel is in all ways but name time travel, and the universe does not tolerate time travel. Coordinates calculated in the universal pyramid system by a pyramid computer ensure that a vessel arrives when it arrives, so to speak. The alternative is going nowhere at all ‚Äî there is no in-between.\nSuperluminal systems are affected by gravity, so any person looking to exceed the speed of light and subsequently visit other stars must take the highways beyond our home system‚Äôs planetary orbit and launch into so-called free-travel from there. There are only a handful of these highways ‚Äî the solar system is very, very large, and human construction is very, very small.\nThere was an instinct among many people that human progress would naturally scale exponentially ‚Äî these were extrapolated from the remarkable progress in the lifetime of Tzipora‚Äôs parents and grandparents, who saw canvas aircraft in their childhood advance to the landing of a man on the moon, and again in her own exaggerated lifetime, in which the provinciality of her youth has simultaneously seen an expansion and exploitation of the planets in our native solar system.\nThis curve of progress was not to be, however ‚Äî and it also explains why we had such trouble meeting aliens in the first place. Part of it was simply that there are very few worlds with water that also formed earthlike landmasses nearby ‚Äî there are many aliens, and Tzipora has seen many herself, but most of them are fish and fish-adjacent. The second is that, if there is civilised life out there, it has most probably encountered the same engineering truths that humanity did, in our great interstellar project of the last thousand years. Namely that, all accounted for, there is no use for wasteful megastructures when a small one will do. People are having less children ‚Äî on Mars, Mercury and Neptune, the population is actually shrinking. What good is the so-called ‚Äúocean liner of the stars,‚Äù with a capacity of millions? There are around 12 billion people across the solar system today. Maybe another 8 billion in the Ala system. Maybe a few millions more who have simply given up society for scattered stars in our neighbourhood.\nIt is likely that if any other civilised races exist, they are simply of our scale, or have destroyed themselves completely in the reckless pursuit of expansion. Humanity is lucky not to count themselves among them.\nThe APRICOT is one of many models produced by Vekllei‚Äôs Government Aerospace Factories. It is now possible for the ordinary person to explore distant stars for themselves, granting freedoms unimaginable in a previous age. Such is life in the Great Epoch of Rest.\n"});index.add({'id':48,'href':'/posts/2020-08-01-tzipora-concept/','title':"Meet Tzipora ‚Äî concept panel for a Vekllei comic",'section':"Archive",'content':"\rArchived from the original article here\r\rüåº Featured in the Atlantic\nThis article appeared in Issue #3 of the Atlantic Bulletin.

She has a small overbite that makes her look a little froggy, and ritually pulls on her shirt and wipes her nose in anxious conversation. She is round-headed and cuts her hair herself. She talks in a low, expressive voice. She has been poorly socialised in childhood, and is afraid of casual conversation with people she does not know. She is keenly socially attuned and feels awkwardness painfully.\nShe wears the same clothes two or three days in a row. The outfits themselves are variations of the same thing, and her tastes don‚Äôt change. Everything hangs off her ‚Äî she likes baggy, airy clothing, and upsizes to accomodate. She doesn‚Äôt like fashionable or voguish people, whom she regards as decadent and offensive. To Tzipora, taste is timeless and bound to the soul. In her case, this fact has held true ‚Äî she has dressed the same as childhood, and very little else has changed about her in that time.\nShe is paranoid and conservative, good-natured and austere, with a moral outlook bound by her deepest anxieties and obsessions. She is deeply spiritual and material, fascinated with objects and their history. She has many collections of many things she‚Äôs found. She‚Äôll likely die a Catholic, but has a confrontational relationship with God and no longer attends mass, as a declaration of humanism. She does not know if this has pissed Him off, but it‚Äôs working out so far. Maybe that‚Äôs why He made her a homosexual ‚Äî to get back at her. He must have a good sense of humour, if that‚Äôs the case.\nTzipora may be intense and inward-facing, but she can also be disarmingly charming and self-deprecating. She has a good sense of humour. There are not many girls that can so easily reconcile the contradictions between the peculiar and the healthy, the eccentric and the friendly, and the violent and the domestic. That‚Äôs part of her character ‚Äî an essence of being that radiates decency, good taste and a respect for the spirit of all things.\n"});index.add({'id':49,'href':'/posts/2020-07-28-summer-house/','title':"Summer House in the Azores",'section':"Archive",'content':"\rArchived from the original article here\r\rüåº Featured in the Atlantic\nThis article appeared in Issue #3 of the Atlantic Bulletin.

Brief reprieves from the North Atlantic cold were granted to hundreds of thousands domestic tourists each year in resorts and holiday rentals alike. Tzipora spent the summer of 2079 there.

You can read it here.\r\r\rLike a lot of girls of poverty, Tzipora was very possessive of her things. No food was ever left on her plate. There was a deep anxiety that whatever wasn‚Äôt claimed would be lost.\nShe was also naturally obsessive and material-oriented, keenly aware of the importance of objects measured by metrics in her own silly head. You can discover a lot about a person from their trinkets and toys ‚Äî let‚Äôs discover a bit about Tzipora.\n Her handbag is manufactured by Spaa S.p.A., a design firm in the capital. They‚Äôre a luxury item in the international market but readily available in Vekllei, since few other handbag makers operate on the scale of Spaa. Ayn picked it out shortly after Tzipora‚Äôs arrival for its colour, after Tzipora told her she did not own any red things. Tzipora has a sweet tooth. Especially for soda, which she calls ‚Äúfizzy drink‚Äù. On her person at any time, she carries a flavoured beverage from one of several brands capable of meeting her discerning tastes. She supplements them with a water bottle, since not even fizzy drink refreshes as well as water after phys-ed or a hot day. She also stocks her arsenal of snacks with good fruit picked off trees that overhang footpaths, as well as devastating salvos of Vekllei‚Äôs finest confectionary, including Fruit Tingles and chocolate pearls. Other girls in her class bemoan her childish metabolism as she drinks soda for lunch while they watch the scales. The nostalgic whimsy of the sweets is tempered by two or three loose cigarettes that float around in her purse at any given time. She‚Äôs not a regular smoker, but she‚Äôs prone to attacks related to stress, and nothing helps as much as a drag. She carries matches, for not much reason other than that‚Äôs what Baron uses, and Tzipora is notoriously sentimental. Tzipora has a rock collection that sits on her bedroom sill, and her recent additions sit at the bottom of her purse. She‚Äôs not a rock elitist; quartz from footpaths catches her attention as easily as igneous treasures like palagonite. Her favourite is obsidian. She carries a small collection of useful books, including a contemporary paperback and a notebook. The paperback is for recess and lunch; the notebook is for language notes and phone numbers. Her Vekllei I.D. papers, which are both a passport and a reference booklet of key information and services, are carried on her at all times. It‚Äôs not really necessary in day-to-day life ‚Äî but who knows when it might be, and Tzipora won‚Äôt be the one patting her pockets at the airport gate. Finally, there are a few accessories sitting in the bag. Tzipora made a ring for Cobian in metalworking class, but Cobian is on a school trip to France at the moment and Tzipora is waiting for her return. She has a wristwatch given to her by Baron, which she wears sometimes depending on the occasion. Other items are more precautionary ‚Äî a scarf for the wind, a handkerchief for sneezing, and a spare pair of socks for when she visits Cobian‚Äôs house or if she needs to double up in cold weather. As summer turns to autumn, she also carries gloves and a beanie.  With everything in its place, her handbag is her anchor in the world outside her small second-floor apartment. The decommodification of society has only intensified the social value of objects, and they remain as important as ever in the life of the ordinary Vekllei person.\n"});index.add({'id':52,'href':'/posts/2020-07-13-economy/','title':"The Race for Inefficiency ‚Äî Vekllei‚Äôs advocation of austerity, apathy, and playfulness as economic principles",'section':"Archive",'content':"\rArchived from the original article here\r\rüåº Featured in the Atlantic\nThis article appeared in Issue #3 of the Atlantic Bulletin.

The vast majority of these companies are single-person shops (S.p.A., or senrouiva pettetie anaproiouya). Also common are wobbly shops, or co-operative businesses (S.q.A., or senrouiva qualitie anaproiouya). The largest of the non-bureau companies are village factories (S.p.M., or senrouiva persimonaya manufacturie).\nThe bureau-level world is full of company mastheads that emphasise modernity, dynamism and progress. Vekllei‚Äôs ‚Äúprivate businesses‚Äù, however, tend to be local in taste. The vast majority of S.p.A. and S.q.A. businesses bear the family names of their founders ‚Äî Desmesyo S.p.A., Risyiouisnesn Home Machines S.q.A., etc. Their legal denominations are almost always affixed to the end of their nameplates.\nTheir senrouiva designation marks them as non-bureau businesses. A bureau, as a reminder, is simply the top-level organisation of a trade union that organises business in the country. In practice, it means that a company is responsible to the political organs of the country. Although independent from the government, bureau business is inextricably entwined in government concern and runs parallel to it.\nSenrouvia businesses are also part of the bureau structure, but are in practice not managed directly by them. They are usually united in local concern by so-called petty bureaus; small cooperative organs that safeguard local interest and business. These petty bureaus are often at odds with the bureau organs proper, and so even though they are part of the same structure, they are fundamentally political opposed.\nSo what is sort of business goes on in a bureau proper?\nThere are two common categories of so-called ‚Äúbureau firms‚Äù. You have state industries (S.A., or societie indastrie), which deal with manufacturing and exploitation of resources that require direct management by a public organ. You‚Äôll already be familiar with several ‚Äî General Reactor S.A., Comen Aeroyards S.A., Farmer‚Äôs Syndicate S.A. to name a few.\nYou also have state requisites (A.r., or requoisesiasn amourisocietie), which refer to the vast government-operated organs made up six categories primarily.\n Utilities (A.r.Un.) Transport (A.r.R.) Education (A.r.E.) Local healthcare (A.r.F.) Construction (A.r.Lo.) Automation (A.r.M.)  Yes ‚Äî education is not organised as a government department, but a bureau business. Other state responsibilities are folded directly into government departments ‚Äî war, intelligence, healthcare, police, fire, and the mint are all managed directly by the government.\nArgument\r#\r\rWith the legal division of enterprise laid out, let us examine again the four precepts of the Vekllei economic ideology.\n Self-management and self-interest through Sundress Municipalism. Classification of property as an independent social organ, like nature. Abolishment of currency and currency-substitutes. Participatory employment. Economic feminisation.  These four principles reveal a great deal about the character of the country, and stand largely at face value. There is an interest in chasing the promises of modernity while deconstructing its metaphysical constructions, through the abolishment of exchange-value, property and the overhaul of gender-economics. There are anarchist gestures in each principle, yet it is obvious that the product of these values complexify the conventional anarchist imagination. This is part of a series of contradictions ‚Äî between free and planned markets, between internationalism and provinciality, between man and woman, between freedom and security.\nAusterity\r#\r\rThe bureau system is plagued by inefficiencies, arising from logistic systems premised on warehousing, poor Coasean bargaining between petty bureaus and proper bureaus, a political emphasis on macroeconomic outcomes, a decoupling of aggregate demand and national economic output, cultural intolerance for Pareto inefficiencies, etc.\nLuxury goods often vary in both supply and access, and economies are often severely localised to the point of provincialism, meaning that Vekllei has failed to transition reliably to a modern consumer society. The inhabitants of the Montre borough most often eat seafood because speciality meats, especially authentic red meat, are scarce. The opposite is true in Yana. Clothes are repaired and regifted, appliances are available only from regional outlets usually located in the same city as the factory, and culture and diet are fiercely regional.\nThis is, in part, a result of unflinching national austerity and the sublimation of artificial markets prompted by Vekllei‚Äôs gold-based auxiliary currency, which necessitates meeting debt obligations for its strength internationally. There is a belief in Vekllei that the wealth of the country allowed the abolition of the currency ‚Äî in fact, the opposite is true. The abolition of currency allows a permanent wealth that compensates for the inefficiencies of the bureau system. The bureau firms do not pay their workers ‚Äî on paper, there are no expenses for anything beyond raw commodity exchange. This is how Vekllei‚Äôs largest companies ‚Äî and, per the bureau system, its government ‚Äî remain solvent.\nAusterity is a cultural force, too ‚Äî the scarcity of luxury goods inflates their social value, where comforts and necessities are largely abundant in automation. It creates an unimportant hardship that keeps Vekllei people forward-facing, lean, and ambitious. To acquire Picco S.p.A.‚Äôs iconic lounge chairs, you have to travel to their outlet in Horn, hundreds of kilometres from the capital area. There is no motivation for a craftsman to meet demand ‚Äî there is no petty consumption, either. To own a Picco chair means you have understood its cultural value, utility and craftsmanship, and have made the effort to find and transport one to your home. Inconvenience, and by extension, austerity, is celebrated as a ‚Äútrial of ownership.‚Äù Objects are very important in Vekllei, and craftsmanship is highly valued, and so people like to surround themselves with hand-made, sublime things wrought not just by the labour of the artisan, but their own effort to acquire it.\nPetty austerity instills a national sentiment that tells the ordinary Vekllei person they are hardier than the ordinary American or European, even if the wealth of the ordinary Vekllei person is much greater than that of the ordinary American or European.\nApathy\r#\r\rDespite a vast, loosely organised private market in the senrouiva categorisation, Vekllei does not reward entrepreneurial ambition. Ambitious people are funnelled into positions of power in bureau firms and political office, but the founding of S.p.As and S.q.As is rarely motivated by a desire for influence or power. Indeed, artisanal S.p.As are often incapable of the sort of economies of scale needed for expansion. Vekllei instead relies on a sort of economic apathy, in which aggregate demand and productivity are spurned for immediate interest and pleasure.\nThis ensures that\n luxury products remain creative, personal works per Upen‚Äôs insistence on the symbiosis of labour and product the private senrouiva market is not capable of threatening the provincialism of Sundress Municipalism, which might make a commodity universally accessible and threaten to introduce generic consumer society into Vekllei life the private senrouiva market under petty bureau organisation does not threaten the organised de facto monopolies of the bureau companies  If Vekllei has replaced the commodity with the object, then it is through economic apathy that they have ensured objects will never again become commodities. Just as the ordinary Vekllei person is apolitical, so too are they apathetic towards change in their purchasing habits, favouring small, inconvenient and personal brands over those exploiting aggregate demand. In a sense, this also contributed to the popular Vekllei term product atheism, in which the metaphysics of products are dismantled and rearranged into social forms.\nIn this sense, the apathy is found on both ends ‚Äî within the senrouiva business owner, who is provided little upward mobility to satisfy ambition beyond local and regional expansion, and within the consumer, who recognises products only within cultural and social dimensions. Neither is conducive to a functioning, fair market on an interregional scale.\nPlay\r#\r\rPlay is the foundational motivation of most work in Vekllei. There are existential motivators, too ‚Äî a desire to wield power, or professional legacy ‚Äî but in many professions it is play by which a Vekllei person justifies labour. It is also why work is fiercely protected by petty bureaus and other labour organisations ‚Äî work is their connection to wider society, and that connection is held sacred in Upen.\nIt is through work as play that Vekllei is able to justify the employment of children. Financial motivations for work have all but disappeared ‚Äî in its place, the workplace has to convince people to work. There are few state protections for businesses unable to maintain a workforce, either ‚Äî it is one of the most common reasons for the shuttering of a company. The boss must convince his workers to stay, and so a total inversion of power has occurred.\nIn place of money, there is prestige, and in prestige there is myth. Few people have genuine interest in Fordism. Many more are attracted to the hand-crafted furniture of Picco S.p.A., and becoming recognised as a builder of great things. In a sense, a person ‚Äúacts out‚Äù the role of a craftsman, in the same way a person ‚Äúacts out‚Äù the role of a police officer, or ‚Äúacts out‚Äù life as a pilot.\nIn this system, the childish spirit of recreation, duty and ‚Äúthe adult world‚Äù is acted out by millions of Vekllei people each day. Seeds planted by a child play-acting as a farmer continue to grow, and so too does the Vekllei economy feed its population through the intersection of fantasy and labour. At this point it is obvious that play is not fantasy at all, but in fact a motivation for labour as genuine as profit. Where it falls short, in hard, disempowering jobs, it is automated and conscripted through the mandatory service system. As it is often described:\n‚ÄúThe Bureau System is labour-intensive where wanted, alleviated by industrial machinery where preferred, and automated where necessary.‚Äù\nIn its wake are states of play, and through play comes a decent framework for living, obvious in the basic satisfaction of the Vekllei people.\n"});index.add({'id':53,'href':'/posts/2020-07-08-police/','title':"Police in Vekllei",'section':"Archive",'content':"\rArchived from the original article here\r\rüåº Featured in the Atlantic\nThis article appeared in Issue #3 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.\r\r\rThere are two regular police organs in Vekllei.\n Fedecenoayan porits (national police, or venopor) Comoisniyan denporitsa (local police, or cosmopor)  A young venopor officer stands on the left, in the full street regalia they‚Äôre renowned for. Unlike cosmopor, they often carry machine guns while on patrol and are stationed outside of government buildings, hospitals, train stations, ports, schools and any company managed directly by a bureau, which is a trade organ of national importance. They are special units of special purpose, and supplement the deficiencies of local policing through their training and tactical deployment.\nThey are police insofar as they protect and respond to their community, including through special tactics situations, but are paramilitary in their wider function as a defence force for critical infrastructure. This is reflected in their history, traced cleanly back past independence and the Atomic War to the royal guards and junta federal police of old society, which continue to be reflected in their uniforms and several other ceremonial artefacts, like swords and knee boots. Venopor is a complex organisation with many different purposes. There are street patrols, pictured here, but there are also intelligence units associated with HO/NI and by extension the military, as well as tactical response teams, bomb squads, search and rescue and most other specialised emergency units outside of the capabilities of any given local police station.\nThis is contrast to the cosmopor, a more conventional police outfit. A cosmopor officer stands on the right, in standard summer uniform. He carries a radio, revolver and rubber baton for the worst of his duties, and is embedded deep into his local community. Cosmopor officers traditionally visit and introduce themselves to each house in their beat, and spend far more of their time mediating, counselling and organising than they do making arrests. The autonomy of most Vekllei communities largely spurns petty legal proceedings, and so the cosmopor are a critical aspect of sundress municipalism, resolving disputes personally and taking custody of a person only when it‚Äôs needed. Most crime in Vekllei tends to be emotionally motivated ‚Äî so it is in this domain that cosmopor navigate.\nThis makes the cosmopor especially powerful figures in a Vekllei village or township, but their duties are closely watched. While the Vekllei village may be autonomous, all officers in Vekllei are responsible to a division of venopor called ‚Äúofficer welfare,‚Äù or picosec, which operates autonomously to seek out incompetent or misbehaving police officers, no matter their jurisdiction or status. Where most business in Vekllei has very little in the way of professional behaviour or ‚Äúwork culture‚Äù, policing in Vekllei is held to high standards, and they are severely bound by traditions that have become codified as the country has grown. This is a time and place where the children of police often inherit the jobs of their parents, and the constables of a village often have roots that go back centuries. This often makes cosmopor very respected figures, and their successors and recruits are expected to work for that respect.\nIn a country that has done away with money as a measure of success, professional legacy is profoundly important in Vekllei. In this inversion of priority, teachers, doctors, pilots, constables and librarians are celebrated. This is not founded in a general egalitarianism, but in fact the precise opposite ‚Äî a celebration of success and influence, touching the lives of those around them. The glamour, and paycheque, has largely been stripped away. Only the work remains, and so that work has become more important than ever.\n"});index.add({'id':54,'href':'/posts/2020-06-30-project/','title':"What is This Project?",'section':"Archive",'content':"\rArchived from the original article here\r\rüåº Featured in the Atlantic\nThis article appeared in Issue #2 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.\r\r\rWhat is Vekllei?\nHi, I‚Äôm Hobart and I write and draw Vekllei at Studio MillMint.\nThis is a pretty complex project. Not just complex insofar as there‚Äôs a lot to read about it, but that it uses concepts and terminology you might not be familiar with if this is your first time around utopian fiction.\nSo Vekllei is a utopia ‚Äî what does this mean? It‚Äôs latin for ‚Äúno place,‚Äù and I use that literally. Vekllei, in a literal sense, cannot exist. Not because I think it could never have existed, or that some part of it is completely unreasonable, or it breaks the laws of physics ‚Äî but because it exists in a certain place and time that is just isn‚Äôt replicable. It‚Äôs all built from the ground up.\nVekllei is a very good place to live, but it is not perfect. Utopia does not mean ‚Äúperfect place‚Äù. Utopia is a form of social dreaming, much like worldbuilding, linked to the values and priorities of its author. In utopian studies, ‚Äúutopia‚Äù is usually broken down further:\n Eutopia ‚Äî ‚Äúgood place‚Äù Dystopia ‚Äî ‚Äúbad place‚Äù  Note that both form a part of the ‚Äúutopia‚Äù ‚Äî this is appropriate, since Vekllei is grounded in a social realism that acknowledges the good and bad parts of life. Indeed, they are inseparable ‚Äî you cannot have the light without the dark. Obviously, in my eyes, Vekllei is very much a eutopia. You can read more about Vekllei (the country) by clicking here.\nThere are three parts to my ‚Äúsocial dreaming‚Äù:\n Landscape ‚Äî the world and country of Vekllei. When you think of ‚Äúutopia,‚Äù this is it ‚Äî shining modernist cities against striking landscapes. Character ‚Äî not all social dreaming takes place in spaces. Some of it is built around experiences, objects and relationships. Tzipora is a ‚Äúcharacter utopia‚Äù in the sense that she represents a utopian life experience, full of stories good and bad. Author ‚Äî Vekllei is a representation of the problems of my life, as a form of escapism. A lot of my posts here reflect dissatisfactions and displacements in my own life ‚Äî consumer society, commodification of childhood, wage labour, postmodernism, etc. I‚Äôm very much a part of this utopian dialectic.  Let‚Äôs run through some of the common queries and misunderstandings about Vekllei\nWho are you? A Tasmanian illustrator.\nYou‚Äôre not Japanese? „ÅäÂâç„ÅØ„ÇÇ„ÅÜÊ≠ª„Çì„Åß„ÅÑ„Çã\nWhy is Vekllei a utopia? It makes me feel better about my life and the world. It‚Äôs escapism; it‚Äôs a dream.\nIt‚Äôs a bit cringe to grandstand your political beliefs, doncha think? Vekllei is a personal utopia. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm selling. At least you‚Äôre getting good opinions.\nWhere‚Äôs the tension if it‚Äôs perfect? Vekllei is very cynical and tragic in places. Utopia is just a reflection of the author, good and bad.\nIs there a novel? A story? A comic? I‚Äôm working on a comic right now. I‚Äôm pretty much working on Vekllei full-time so I‚Äôm hoping to announce it soon. I‚Äôve got a lot of different Vekllei projects going.\nWhere is Vekllei? Iceland.\nWhy does Vekllei look Japanese? Vekllei is like a country of Scandinavians speaking French with an Aussie accent in Sh≈çwa era Japan/Maoist China/Taiwan etc. Vekllei looks however I imagine utopia looks.\nHow does that make sense? Why can‚Äôt it just be cool?\nIs your alt-history thought out? Vekllei‚Äôs history is whatever I need it to be. I‚Äôm always trying to be realistic, but it‚Äôs all worked backwards from the setting. I‚Äôm not really ‚Äúworldbuilding‚Äù in a typical sense. Very little of it is published, most of it is retrieved on request. Just ask if you have questions.\nIs Vekllei communist? No.\nBut Vekllei calls itself ‚Äúpetticoat socialist‚Äù. Vekllei is set in a culture of Marxist revivalism in the 50s and 60s. A lot of Vekllei‚Äôs lexicon is set in that context. Vekllei is a decentralised democracy that doesn‚Äôt use money. It‚Äôs a sort of participatory economy.\nWhy the \u0026ldquo;petticoat\u0026rdquo;? Vekllei is a female country. Womanhood is decommodified. It\u0026rsquo;s maternal, social and friendly where socialist rhetoric is masculine, technocratic and progressive.\nWho is Zelda? Zelda is another name for Tzipora. She has two names specifically to confuse you.\nWhat is the ‚Äúbulletin‚Äù? I publish the Atlantic Bulletin once a month via email. It‚Äôs got the month‚Äôs posts in it as well as facts and tidbits from Vekllei.

Anything larger than that is simply Vekllei ‚Äî they are ‚Äúone city‚Äù, after all, and consider themselves a city-state.\nThere have been exactly 100 boroughs since 2015. Each is named after the largest city in its region.\n The smallest borough is Bakur, in Afouismeh, with a population of 7,500 people. The largest is Vekllei proper, in the Capital Region, of 2.4 millions.  This transit map illustrates all 100 boroughs, Vekllei‚Äôs five tallest mountains, its permafrost glaciers and Tzipora‚Äôs home in Montre-Lola. Her five largest boroughs ‚Äî namely Vekllei, Lonne, Adouisneh, Montre and Copette, are highlighted.\nEven in this simple transit map we can see several truths about the country, like its population bias on the West Coast and the emptiness of the Lava volcanic region. You might recognise a few names there, like Lola in the West (Tzipora‚Äôs home with Baron) and Yana in Vekllei‚Äôs Ro Highlands (Ayn‚Äôs birthplace).\nTrains are clean, reliable, fast, efficient and safe. They are incorporated under Vekllei Rail, owned by the Transport Group Bureau. Using this map, designed for domestic tourists and foreigners, the adequacy of Vekllei‚Äôs rail transport is easy to plan around ‚Äî you can eat breakfast in a cafe in the seaside town of Mumen, and hike before midday on the glacial slopes of Askayoisn. Since there are no tickets or costs, there are no excuses for not visiting relatives in the country, now that transport is now a trivial inconvenience.\nEach borough is represented in Vekllei‚Äôs parliament by an elected representative. These representatives wield extraordinarily disproportionate power ‚Äî the representative for Callaisn, for example, represents hundreds of times more people than the representative for Tanger, but both have the same vote. This is because boroughs are not just representative of their populations, but also their environments, industry and other social organs otherwise unable to vote. It is important to keep in mind that Upen (and consequently, policy) recognises the landscape itself as the sovereign organ of the country, and so in this sense it has its own interests and projections.\nIn practice, representatives act in an advisory, nonpartisan role in government, voting rarely in an auxiliary role to the professionalised, elected legislature. Vekllei has a strictly constitutional parliament, and the economy largely prohibits interference. In this sense, the parliament is both partially undemocratic in its inefficiency and apolitical in its orientation as a sort of civil service bureau, managing state affairs and reacting to pressures and the long-term aims outlined in the 2015 constitution. In the Vekllei mindset, the ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù is more or less another bureau, no different or particularly more interesting than the Transport Group Bureau. The trains, at least, have a tangible impact on their daily lives.\nHow appropriate, then, that this transit map produced in the summer months of 2076 combines both monuments of society. It also offers a glimpse of a larger, documented country not necessarily revealed in piecemeal story posts.\n"});index.add({'id':56,'href':'/posts/2020-06-24-crown/','title':"The Vekllei Crown ‚Äî coins of a moneyless country",'section':"Archive",'content':"\rArchived from the original article here\r\rüåº Featured in the Atlantic\nThis article appeared in Issue #2 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.\r\r\rVekllei, legendarily, does not use circulate currency. Goods and services are moved and offered arbitrarily, provided amply in abundance. Anything that is not abundant is manufactured and distributed directly under the control of a bureau, which is a trade organ responsible to the affairs of the country. At no point do coins or paper currency change hands in the day-to-day affairs of the country.\nIn this sense, Vekllei is usually described as ‚Äúmoneyless‚Äù ‚Äî yet it does in fact have a currency. The Vekllei Kroner, or ‚ÄúCrown,‚Äù is hundreds of years old, and Vekllei still operates a mint for currency. At any time, a Vekllei person can write to the National Mint and order a set of coins, like the ones pictured above. So what is going on here?\nAlthough the Kroner has not been used since 2022, after the last village in Stochi returned coinage to the Mint, it continues to exist to this day as a gold-backed currency in the International Market, through which Vekllei trades with other countries. The physical coins, produced mostly as a novelty in the tradition of mayaesdiou (medallions, or small metal pieces commonly collected and given in Vekllei), are a physical coinage of the International Market. The coins also operate as a form of bullion, or wealth reserve, since each coin is worth exactly its face value in gold. Since the International Market is completely closed and independent of the domestic economy, its value is controlled directly by the so-called Government Bank. It is one of the few gold-backed currencies in a developed nation today.\nTo further complicate things, there are actually two different Kroner in Vekllei. There is the Vekllei Kroner, which represents the International Market, but there is also a seperate Government/State Kroner, which is not minted and used only as an investment mechanism, backed by government \u0026ldquo;white bonds\u0026rdquo; which are usually measures of labour-hours or refined materials. It is, in a sense, a fiat currency alongside a gold-backed currency.\nThey exist independently because they are used for two seperate purposes. The Vekllei Kroner is used a wealth reserve and bullion, and also represents the collective wealth of the Vekllei people. Each citizen, in theory, is entitled to an equal share of the Government Bank, although it can only be withdrawn as currency in specific circumstances. Vekllei also holds substantial amounts of foreign currency in the Government Bank and Vekllei Kroner, which is used to invest and stabilise holdings and capital in foreign countries. The Government Kroner, on the other hand, is used as an investment mechanism abroad, usually in support of infrastructure. It is also used to acquire foreign currencies through investment in foreign capital.\nDespite having two currencies, neither the \u0026ldquo;Vekllei Crown\u0026rdquo; or the \u0026ldquo;Government Crown\u0026rdquo; are used in the domestic economy in Vekllei, which is autonomous and not subject to a central bank. So it is that Vekllei‚Äôs currency is both little more than a novelty and essential to the function of the country in a world still ruled by money.\n In the coinage depicted above ‚Äî 8 coins are minted in Vekllei today. They were designed in 2015, in the year of independence. They represent eight core values in the country.\nThe ‚Äúsmall crowns,‚Äù worth 1VK and 10VK respectively, represent fraternity and liberty, two founding elements of the Vekllei constitution. The 50VK coin is plated in silver and has a small ruby inset. Rubies are used to represent energy, in this case, the vitality of the spirits, which dominate Upen and the Vekllei landscape. The 100, 200, 500 and 1,000VK coins represent different landscapes of the country. As a volcanic island nation, the ocean (100) and landscape (200) coins are fairly straightforward. The humanity coin (500) represents the Vekllei people and ancestry ‚Äî note how humans are placed alongside other natural forces. The flower coin (1,000VK) represents the flowers of the country, which are important spiritually and have formed part of the Vekllei identity. Vekllei has the most flowers per capita in the world. The final, larger 10,000VK coin represents the previous seven together, as a total sum of Vekllei landscape and identity.\n To answer Tzipora‚Äôs question ‚Äî a bottle of fizzy drink cost about 2VK in the waning days of coinage in the early 2020s.\n"});index.add({'id':57,'href':'/posts/2020-06-29-montrelola/','title':"Village Map of Montre-Lola",'section':"Archive",'content':"\rArchived from the original article here\r\rüåº Featured in the Atlantic\nThis article appeared in Issue #2 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.\r\r\rThe village of Montre-Lola is home to about 400 people in its entirety, a stone‚Äôs throw from the Aisyo borough. Each morning, however, the population swells as 300 children from tiny villages in both Aisyo and Montre take a fast tram to the Montre-Lola Area School No. 2, a district school raising all ages of local youth.\nLike many Vekllei villages, Montre-Lola‚Äôs history is complex and has origin stories in both viking-inuit settlement as well as less sentimental government programmes that flourished after the atomic war. By historical accounts, Montre-Lola has been inhabited since at least 1500CE. By contemporaneous records, however, it was established as a village in land reform during the 1960s and revitalised by the building of the area school in 2057.\nMontre-Lola features many civic objects common to Vekllei villages ‚Äî a nondenominational place of worship (in this case, a historical Catholic church), a constabulary, a doctor, an auto/tractor pool, a general store, a station platform, and a village hall. A map of the village centre is dominated by the Area School, built in an Edunewda style, which features many new facilities that distinguish it from smaller, 20th-century schools. It‚Äôs a good place to grow up; where farmland and earnest modernity collide.\n Montre-Lola is most relevant as the residence of Tzipora Desmoisnes, the world‚Äôs oldest person and one of the first people to be diagnosed with Gregori-Heitzfeld Syndrome. She works as a librarian in both the Montre-Lola Area School and the Montre-Lola Library \u0026amp; Archives, spending most of her 12-hour workday in either of these institutions. She commutes via fast trams, which arrive automatically at the two platforms in Montre-Lola every half-hour and continue out into the surrounding farms. This means that, if she sets her watch right, she can step outside her front door and arrive at the school library in under ten minutes. This journey is marked in red on the map above.\n Dominated by farmland, Montre-Lola is communal and more traditionally ‚Äòanarchist‚Äô in flavour than Vekllei‚Äôs urban boroughs, which are obscured by convenience. As charming as it is suffocating, the community is very close-knit and made up of all sorts ‚Äî smart educated young men and women sent from Montre to teach, as well as farming families that have resided here for centuries. Life moves slower and people know each other. When the school hosts its cross-country race each year, nearly every person in the village is out to watch it. After all, it takes a village to raise a child.\n"});index.add({'id':58,'href':'/posts/2020-06-12-ayn/','title':"A Most Beautiful Woman",'section':"Archive",'content':"\rArchived from the original article here\r\rüåº Featured in the Atlantic\nThis article appeared in Issue #2 of the Atlantic Bulletin.

Tzipora was not quite sure how to describe it. Her beauty was very alive in the way she inhabited a space, as she walked into the hotel lounge to meet them. Maybe it was grace ‚Äî maybe it was a little girl-crush ‚Äî she didn‚Äôt know.\nAs Baron greeted her and they exchanged cheek kisses, it appeared to Tzipora that Ayn and Baron were old friends, and she was further assured in her respect for him ‚Äî that Baron could know such beautiful women seemed natural! Baron was capable of anything in Tzipora‚Äôs eyes, a figure of ultimate power ‚Äî it only made sense that he knew this woman!\nOf course, both Ayn and Baron were mortal, and Tzipora got to know them well during the helter-skelter weeks following her arrival in Vekllei. Baron might have rescued her, but it was Ayn who introduced her to Vekllei, as AB/NI called Baron into office for the first time in a decade. It was Ayn who took her clothes shopping and wrestled with Zelda‚Äôs obsessive-compulsive fabric requirements. It was Ayn who taught Tzipora her first Vekllei sentence. And in the end, it was Ayn who convinced Baron that he had to take responsibility for Tzipora.\nIt was only years later that Tzipora began to realise that Ayn and Baron were, in a sense, married to each other through their work.

You can read it here.\r\r\rVekllei‚Äôs defensive military posture has, in doctrine and arms development, limited its ability to meaningfully project power outside of the Atlantic. As an island nation with a large and multifaceted naval armada, the Oa-Class Battlecruiser is the heart of her armed forces, as the flagship of her fleets.\nWhere U.S. doctrine places carriers offensively in the structure of its ship-groups, the Vekllei Navy is considerably more Soviet in its employ of carriers as primarily defensive air-bases to exercise sovereignty over her far-flung territories and island possessions. Oa-class Battlecruisers are notable as hybrid carrier-battleships, and feature a diagonal jetway with capacity for carrier-type naval jets (almost indistinguishable in the illustration above) and a variety of VTOL aircraft, which are common by the 2050s.\nFirst built in the 2050s by the sprawling National Naval Arsenal (located on Vekllei‚Äôs Far East coast, close to the foundries that pour her iron), 12 Oa-Class Battlecruisers are in service in the 2070s. They carry heavy fission reactors built by bureau monopoly General Reactor, supplemented by a gas-turbine generator, as is standard on all Vekllei-built nuclear vessels. Her unusual serpentine funnel is characteristic of Vekllei‚Äôs navy, and is a distinguishing feature of their naval design language.\nHer hulking superstructure and massive 15-inch fore guns recall the capital battleships of yesteryear, but she is a thoroughly modern battlecruiser with contemporary armament and electrics for combat and fleet administration. Named after Vekllei‚Äôs National flower, these Battlecruisers are the third-largest vessels in the navy and are multifunctional by design, often operated as strategic and operational platforms to support Vekllei‚Äôs large defensive armadas that patrol the North Atlantic.\n She is armed with two triple-barrelled 15-inch shore guns that can be loaded with a variety of shells including nuclear payloads, silos for guided missiles, and specialised guns and missile platforms for anti-ship, submarine and satellite warfare. Her powerful communications array and sensors are positioned 80 meters above the surface for the benefit of radar and subsurface monitoring. She can also support up to 12 standard carrier jets at one time, or 16 individual helijets/VTOL craft.\n Vekllei has larger battlecruisers (the so-called super-battlecruisers match her height and are nearly twice her length) and much larger carriers, but the displacement of the vessel was never a priority. Vekllei‚Äôs naval architecture prioritises mobility and capability in their capital ships, and so the Oa-class vessels represent many intersecting vertices of Vekllei‚Äôs naval doctrine.\n"});index.add({'id':60,'href':'/posts/2020-06-03-canal/','title':"Canal Living",'section':"Archive",'content':"\rArchived from the original article here\r\rüåº Featured in the Atlantic\nThis article appeared in Issue #2 of the Atlantic Bulletin.

Ocean-going fishing boats brought their haul to Ro, where they cruised wide postwar canals and unloaded tonnes of shiny, bright salmon into processing plants. If a new factory was built, so too was a canal or a railroad. Nothing was trucked. Fish was traded fresh in markets or turned into emulsifiers and fertiliser.\nThe canals were worked heavily, and few fishing vessels were incorporated. The vast majority of Vekllei‚Äôs fishing fleet was owned by the people that worked them, trading with the Sea Office. From a quaisiosn or ‚Äúcanal park‚Äù you might see a dozen vessels in an hour. Some were run-down prewar things limping out to the shallow coasts, while others were nuclear-powered salmon trawlers designed for the storms of the Atlantic. On the northern coast, the bigger boats were reinforced as ice-breakers. Fish was one of the few meats in the Vekllei diet that wasn‚Äôt grown in an industrial laboratory, a fact reflected in the scale of its infrastructure.\nCanals are good for a city, and are good for the heart. Tzipora would take long walks in the morning along the Wellington Canal to where it met Touismah, then follow it to where it circled back into Lola. She would figure out what she was doing with her life as the boats departed for the day‚Äôs catch. She never much liked salmon, but she liked the boats. They were an island country, and their futures and pasts met in the sea ‚Äî where it churned and swelled in their dreams.\n"});index.add({'id':61,'href':'/posts/2020-06-01-fission/','title':"Fission Cloud at Vekllei's 50th Anniversary",'section':"Archive",'content':"\rArchived from the original article here\r\rüåº Featured in the Atlantic\nThis article appeared in Issue #1 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.\r\r\rIn an unprecedented event, during Vekllei‚Äôs 50th Sea Festival since Independence in 2065, an 8 kiloton fission bomb was sunk to a depth of 150 meters and detonated at midday. It was an incredible sight on a day so clear you could see the gentle curve of the earth where it met the horizon. A flash of light and a spray dome surged outwards into the quiet Atlantic, which was broken apart by plumes that formed a column of water that climbed high into the sky. The lateral plumes, the ‚Äúmushroom‚Äù, reached far across the horizon, forming thick clouds that would begin to rain into the sea. From the coast, fifteen kilometres away, a warm light bathed observers and was followed a moment later by a bang that deeply shook you and those around you. In this instance it seemed that the whole universe was their domain.\nThe plume would rise nearly 1,500 metres into the sky before falling away. It stayed that way for a while. Almost nobody moved for a long time after ‚Äî people stood on cars and tables. You could only recognise the scale and the feeling of the fission bomb by seeing it in person.\nIt seemed incomprehensible, in the face of such a device, that wars could still be fought at all. What use is a battleship in the face of a cloud like that?\n Tzipora and Elise, covering the detonation for Lola 7th School‚Äôs student newspaper, found themselves not quite sure what to say. Elise wrote, captioning Tziproa‚Äôs photograph, ‚ÄúThe Independence bomb filled our sky with our sea for a half-hour on Sunday, and with it rose the thoughts of every person in attendance, who considered the awesome power now shouldered by each of us.‚Äù\n There was indeed some sense that they had contributed to the bomb, and that they had more at their disposal. Few would fly the planes to deliver them, and fewer still had the brains to develop them, but participating in a nuclear century contributed to, in some effect, a nuclear horizon.\n"});index.add({'id':62,'href':'/posts/2020-05-27-rain/','title':"Hot Rain in the Arctic Circle",'section':"Archive",'content':"\rArchived from the original article here\r\rüåº Featured in the Atlantic\nThis article appeared in Issue #1 of the Atlantic Bulletin.

You can read it here.\r\r\rWhen I paint Vekllei, I usually depict the warmer months. Hems are shorter, days are longer, and the destabilisation of the world‚Äôs climate has only benefited these arctic people. At the gift end of the Vekllei low pressure system, Scandinavian misery has become Mediterranean pleasure, with warm summers and a mild Autumn and Spring.\nStill, by late October, the the earth is hard with cold and the days are short. The world may be warmer, but Vekllei‚Äôs polar latitude is unchanged, and in the depths of winter the sun only rises for an hour a day. These are Vekllei‚Äôs ‚Äúmoon months‚Äù, and they announce some of the most important spiritual festivals in Upen.\n Although school hours are reduced in winter, life carries on and Vekllei fashion becomes traditionally utilitarian. Tzipora has poor circulation and cold hands even in the warm months, and by November she‚Äôs traded the skirt and gi for traditional rouisha trousers and a cloak. Rouisha, like a lot of traditional clothing, have origins in agriculture and are characterised by a loose, baggy fit and insulated lining. Cobian is wearing a heavy wool sack-type dress, which is worn like an apron over other clothing. Winter brings forth ‚Äúpetticoat society‚Äù literally. Note the leather plate on her shoulder, to which her christmas aiguillette is attached.\n In this sense, Winter‚Äôs revival of traditional clothing and customs further evidences its practice as the most traditional season of the year. Although the warm calendar flourishes with the futurist sympathies of a modernist Vekllei, not even the atomic age has been able to dispense with its hard-worked pragmatism developed in a millennia of bitter cold.\n"});index.add({'id':65,'href':'/posts/2020-05-15-apartment/','title':"2031 Apartment Diagram",'section':"Archive",'content':"\rArchived from the original article here\r\rüåº Featured in the Atlantic\nThis article appeared in Issue #1 of the Atlantic Bulletin.

It was in a mixed residential-industrial neighbourhood, adjacent to a canvas factory. Out back was a rivulet, which roared in the long rainstorms of early April.\n Each January, the Colour Bureau of the Architecture Assembly announces the year‚Äôs colours, and tradition in mainstream architecture and interior design is to incorporate the announced palettes, which usually contain a hundred or so colours. His uncle‚Äôs apartment had been built and furnished in 2031, and so it had a #2031 Colour Profile.\n In some ways, it was a very conventional apartment in the Vekllei tradition. It had a sauna and bath in the wetroom, a bidet, a sunken living room and a bread oven. In others, it was more peculiar. The apartment was bizarrely allocated across three levels. You alighted the entrance light well into a sunken living space, then climbed back up into the kitchen. The main living room and master bedroom were another step above the kitchen. Adjacent to the main living area was a closet and study, which overlooked the entrance from a half-meter mezzanine.\nIt was in this study that Tzipora set up shop when she arrived in March 2063. Baron had been reluctant to take her even provisionally, not least because it would mean searching for a new apartment in his busy return period after being abroad for ten years. Tzipora, however, had lived in a dormitory for much of her life and had settled in the alcove once she acquired a dresser screen. She refused outright the master bedroom, which sparked a sleepy agoraphobia. By the time Baron had made other accomodations, Tzipora had entrenched herself in the neighbourhood and had developed a severe sentimentality about the apartment and its rivulet, and so that was where he lived for the rest of his life.\nIn this sense, Tzipora had a strange kinship with the apartment. Baron sealed himself off in the master bedroom each night, but she never left the main living space. It was warm in there, especially in the flickering light of the enormous oven and fireplace, and when she moved the screen aside in the morning her little corner became part of the living area.\nShe had a lot of good memories of that apartment.\n"});index.add({'id':66,'href':'/posts/2020-05-13-tzipostcards/','title':"Announcing Tzipo-stcards",'section':"Archive",'content':"\rArchived from the original article here\r\r\rHello everyone.

Tzipora was not much interested in health, but she was interested in walking, and she made a pilgrimage along the coast every few years to make sense of the world. She was going whichaway and destined for nowhere in particular. Tzipora was very much Baron‚Äôs daughter, in the end.\nShe had stopped to see the Red Cliffs forty kilometres out from Tjornes when she saw a cruiser of the constabulary parked unusually by the shore. The constabulary were not local police ‚Äî they were a national outfit tasked with policing government and ‚Äúbureau business‚Äù. You found them at power plants, outside universities, guarding the prime minister and providing bodies for HO/NI (Home Office at National Intelligence) when they needed doors kicked.\nTzipora was not the sort of girl to be intimidated by a badge, and she wandered innocently to the shore where she found the cruiser empty. She looked across a beach of black sand and saw some sort of operation playing out ‚Äî there was a gun boat not too far from the shore, and a police hydrofoil beached on the sand. She counted maybe a dozen officers. She wondered if they‚Äôd arrest her if she walked down to see what was happening. She climbed onto the hood of the cruiser to get a better look. Perhaps it was immigrants ‚Äî or smugglers.\nIt only took another moment to spot the smashed crates broken across the rocks before she knew what was going on. She was witnessing the dying days of the countercultural decade, and its chemical fuel was now smashed open before her.\n The 2070s were a wild time for the so-called ‚Äúpink years‚Äù in Vekllei, and for the first time in Tzipora‚Äôs memory she started seeing ‚Äúpleasure drugs‚Äù on the streets. There had always been plenty of sin carrying on in Vekllei, even in her early days ‚Äî hallucinogenics, alcohol, and synthesised highs were legal and easy. But you didn‚Äôt see much of the exotic stuff, which grew in a better climate. Hash, coke, H ‚Äî it was all underground stuff for personal use. These drugs were listed among many others in the class-A import prohibition orders, which made them hard to find and illegal to import. These were ‚Äúpleasure drugs‚Äù ‚Äî the Vekllei phrase for overseas narcotics that didn‚Äôt have a place in Upen or a preexisting cultural history. Comparatively, they were just ‚Äòfor pleasure‚Äô.\nH for heroin was a big news item for a long time, and with it you had one the largest moral panics in modern Vekllei cultural memory. Crackdowns came soon after. Tzipora found it difficult to describe the feeling of the time. It was a new generation ‚Äî one she didn‚Äôt belong to, despite her appearance ‚Äî and she didn‚Äôt have much sympathy for hedonists. They might tell her different, but she never thought the pink years were about much more than feeling good all of the time. She wondered if she was growing old and grumpy inside.\n She wondered how the crates had got there. Had the coast guard sunk another smugger? You heard about the navy firing shots in the news sometimes.\nRuined with seawater and picked over by constables, the chemical feast of Vekllei‚Äôs pink years died with the times.

They built her a fireplace big enough to keep her loft warm and the bread hot. She was a small girl and had to split her wood with a pedal saw, which she fed wood from her journeys for kindling.\nShe cycled to the village a kilometre down the road each morning, where she worked in the district library. People from villages nested in the hills and valleys made the commute here, to see films and borrow books. It was funny to her that the scope of the books were so worldly and comprehensive, and that the lives here were so small and pleasant. Living like this, the whole world seemed like a distant curiosity, far removed from their concern.\n\rMuch like the inversion of the sublime, Tzipora found an inversion of priority in Montre-Lola too. Time and space seemed to collapse in on themselves here, and all abstractions and petty knowledge was squashed. All that existed was the immediate relationship between herself and her surrounds ‚Äî the old path and tractor, the flowers and drumlins ‚Äî each heartbeat after the next, life and death adjacent, the future and past as quiet as the present.

Her medical problems; her violent childhood; her sensitivity and melancholy ‚Äî you could feel sorry for her, because a lot of her problems were not her fault. She invoked sympathy.\nTzipora never considered herself particularly tragic. It seemed straightforward, if difficult; she continued to live ‚Äî and so she lived. Tzipora\u0026rsquo;s sympathy was instead reserved for her first and closest friend: Cobian.\nCobian was not well-liked at school, and it did not take long for Tzipora to find out why. She had a childish edge for a sixteen-year-old, and bitterly hated losing. She was not good at school or sports, was not particularly charming, and came across as desperately lonely. She was a quiet misandrist, which would have been fine if she could play the part of a self-assured social matriarch, but her mother‚Äôs despotic conservatism struck out that possibility early on. Such is life.\nAnd because her world was predicated on being liked and living a normal life, her psyche prohibited self-reflection. That was the great difference between Cobian and Tzipora. They may both have been young and neurotic, but Tzipora‚Äôs relentless self-interrogation left great space for personal growth. Cobian was instead trapped in a domestic play-fantasy, in which she could live out a mythical high-school life, and shattering that illusion would collapse her whole reason for being.\n Tzipora recalled visiting Cobian‚Äôs home for the first time. Cobian‚Äôs mother asked Tzipora to remove her shoes and socks and wash her feet before going to play inside. By the time Tzipora found Cobian in her room, the girl had already changed and handed over her uniform to be laundered. Tzipora, in her tomboyish indigence, had never encountered such a brutally hygienic regime.\nCobian was a different girl at home. Her anxiety and neurosis washed out a little, and her confidence was propped up by the routines her mother had set out for her since she was a child. There was a friendly, curious girl buried under a decade of loneliness.\n Tzipora wondered what Cobian thought about lying in bed at night, and why the girl worried so much about things that didn‚Äôt matter. And it was precisely in the smallness of those things and the tremendous anxiety Cobian owed toward them that made Tzipora want to hug her. To be so worked up over something so pathetic was startlingly moving. The idea that the girl had deluded herself into a corner of hopelessness seemed sad ‚Äî and the fact that no one would reasonably care about such a feeble, meaningless, self-inflicted state of affairs made it tragic.\nThrough Tzipora‚Äôs friendship and the world it opened up for her, some of Cobian‚Äôs edges were sanded down. Some of it was a late maturity ‚Äî some of it was Tzipora‚Äôs dismantling of the scaffolding the girl‚Äôs mother had shoved in there. With that effort, and obvious love, Cobian‚Äôs reason for being changed too. One day, in Tzipora‚Äôs presence, it didn‚Äôt seem so important to be liked by everybody anymore.\n"});index.add({'id':71,'href':'/posts/2019-08-16-station-dog/','title':"The People of Vekllei‚Äôs Railway (plus Dog)",'section':"Archive",'content':"\rStation Dogs\r#\r\rI‚Äôm starting a series looking at the lives and machines of domestic Vekllei life.\nVekllei National Railways, or ‚ÄòVK Rail‚Äô was the bastard of six major pre-war rail companies that were extinguished along with the society that housed them. Today there are three rail companies in Vekllei, but all of them operate under direct supervision of a Vekllei Industry Bureau (\rmaking it Venrouiva, in other words) and are only broken up for reasons of logistics. So even though a train may run under the Montre Inclinantor Rail Company, it is fundamentally a Vekllei National Railways train much in the same way that all regional airlines are actually fully subsumed by Vekllei International Airways.\nA few characters you‚Äôll find at every manned Vekllei station have been illustrated below.\nThe first, the locomotive engineer, drives a train in four hour shifts. They wear a shoulder plate to distinguish them from other miscellaneous station staff and carry a pedigree in Vekllei culture, as a country dependent almost entirely on rail internally.\nEach station has a station master, who manages the station. In small stations, they do many types of work including maintenance and assisting public enquiry. In large stations, like Vekllei Central Terminus, there are dozens of station masters commanding multiple platforms each and are extremely demanding jobs.\nMost stations also have a most unusual employee, nicknamed in Vekllei a ‚Äòdaughter‚Äô or ‚Äòson of the station,‚Äô who are usually children or teen-agers particularly interested in entering employment with Vekllei Rail and are thus apprenticed in many different roles. They are usually taught some English in a special extracurricular programme and are used as guides for tourists, as Vekllei signage is usually written only in the country‚Äôs native tongue. After a few hours of miscellaneous works a child of the station might ride the trains, checking carriages and platforms for cleanliness and observing passenger behaviour.\nMore recently, stations have been adopting station dogs to help lift spirits among commuters and tourists alike. These dogs, usually of breeds too large for Vekllei apartment lifestyles, have no work but to meet people and offer pets to passing commuters. Some are trained in rescue and as service dogs to those who need them, but for the most part they are simply large dogs in uniform who wander with the station master or child of the station to look for love from strangers.\nAt nearly 20,000kms of rail, Vekllei has one of the most dense and intricate rail systems in the world.

Landscape:¬†for articles on Vekllei and her society, incorporating all that goes with it.  Otherwise, read on for an introduction to this project and what I intend to do with it.\n\rThe Epilogue to the Epoch of Rest\r#\r\rThe core of the Vekllei project¬†is in understanding utopian fiction as a viable means for expressing yourself in two arenas.¬†Creative, as a way of articulating a worldview, and personal, as a way of introspection and projection.\nIn this case, the creative worldview is that of Vekllei ‚Äî a thought experiment in economics, socialpolitik, infrastructure, architecture, demographics, spirituality, language, actualisation, etc. The personal product is Tzipora ‚Äî a character of good mannerisms, language, sense of fashion, ideological disposition, personality and body.\n The premise of an epoch of rest is that the problems unique to an author, the conductor of the orchestra, can be reasoned with and turned into beautiful monuments in a way they can‚Äôt in reality.\n Running low on money? Vekllei does not use money ‚Äî go to a cinema, eat out; have a nice time. Likewise, are you shameful of your body or your ability? Tzipora is fraught with problems, too ‚Äî but look at her!¬†She is beautiful. Repeat this process for all creative arenas and you will find a world you can escape to, away from the problems of your reality.\nKeep in mind that utopia and perfection are two different things.¬†A city can be utopian without it being perfect ‚Äî a relative judgement. Carrying on in this sense, the concept of utopia can equally be applied to a person. The character is not necessarily a romantic interest or charming or intelligent or sexual product, because none of those things really describe utopia ‚Äî instead, a person (a utopian?) is perfect as a collection of ideas and experience. Vekllei is a place of utopia, Tzipora is utopian. And so there are three actors in this project.\nThe Author\r#\r\rThe producer of the whole thing, the creative and personal products are theirs, as unique as a fingerprint. They most likely produce a lot of different societies and characters in trying to tell a story, or flesh out an idea they‚Äôve had ‚Äî but for the purposes of the idea of an epoch of rest, there are two perfect utopias: landscape (society and the world), and character (personality and appearance).\nVekllei [/v∆êk.la…™/]\r#\r\rVekllei is a country in which the external burdens of the world can be shifted. Worries are relegated to the personal ‚Äî an arena in utopian fiction that conveniently still falls under the domain of the author. In Vekllei, self-actualisation is tangible, vivid, only metres away. It might be in creativity or power or love, but it is attainable, because the economic and cultural orchestra of the country is in the imagination of the author, and so it is perfect as by definition of utopia.\nTzipora/Zelda Desmoines [/dz…™pÀà…îÀêr.…ô‚Äôd∆êm.w…ôÀên.∆êÀêh/]\r#\r\rIf Vekllei is the arena of external burden, Tzipora is a girl on which the internal pressures of self-doubt and conscious flaw are cast aside like a rag. In the sense of a narrative, Tzipora might suffer because of her behaviours (her nervous tics, her jealousy, her body and image), but they are adopted in a way that is graceful. So despite her fierce problems, it fades away in the fact that she will not die; she will not be unsuccessful; she will not be unloved. As long as those core premises are true, then every other nervous tic or obsessive-compulsive behaviour are commodity; window-dressing to an aesthetic taste.\nThis project is sort of what I want to do, and I can‚Äôt imagine slowing down anytime soon. Stick around and I‚Äôll do my best materialise the world and story of Vekllei.

Michael Helen-Louisviuan cut his leg on an exposed nail during the deinstallation of old fence posts, and Ana Po cut her thumb on a rose. Both attackers were neutralised appropriately, through planned deinstallation and some mild pruning. The reports were passed onto the local Garden command, where they were filed and will eventually be destroyed after ten years.\n In Vekllei, where a military service of four years is mandatory between the ages of 18 and 32, the purpose of conscription is twofold; first, to ensure the citizenry is at least lightly trained should an invasion follow a nuclear strike, and second; to ensure that important jobs in the country that are not easily automated are always filled.\nA breakdown of the most common roles a Vekllei person will enter upon conscription:\n Construction, 22% \rMisc. support roles for the armed forces, 18% \rCombat roles in the armed forces, 15% Arts work including architecture and garden preservation, 8% \rLocal policing, 6% \rNational policing, 4% Service roles, 4% \rEducation, 2% \rPolitics, 2% \rOther misc. work, 19%  The garden battalions are not simply the pacifist‚Äôs way out ‚Äî there are many other jobs for principled people. Instead, they appeal mostly to those nearing the end of their eligible conscription age who are looking to get service out of the way before family-making or major career advancement.\nIn this sense, conscription for most Vekllei people is a rite of passage that mimics preindustrial ritual, and otherwise defines the transition to adulthood in a country that has largely desegregated aged schooling. It is one of the few times in a Vekllei persons‚Äô life in which the organs of power of the country will interfere directly with their lives, making conscription a welcome structure for young Vekllei boys n gals not yet sure what to do with their lives. Indeed, many of the roles taken on during service will echo throughout their working lives, as gardeners become council planners and labourers become robotics engineers.\nThe truth of automation and work as pleasure is that the unfettered freedom and hedonism of the Vekllei lifestyle can often feel as aimless and agoraphobic as it does liberating. The four years of service in Vekllei‚Äôs military reflect Vekllei in total ‚Äî both in its confronting usurpation of traditional institutions by petticoat ideology and in its tantalising, insatiable liberty and pleasure. The military will let you dip a finger into that well, and help prepare your posture for the leap.\nCaption:\n Tzipora: ‚ÄúThey were telling me! ‚ÄòWe never planted them here!‚Äô The idiots!

Some industry associations attempt to limit availability to minors but generally it\u0026rsquo;s at the discretion of the shopkeeper. Often, shame and embarassment are more powerful tools than legislation in Vekllei.\nGenerally it\u0026rsquo;s pretty traditional stuff supported by columns and fiction, although it varies between pornographers. It\u0026rsquo;s quite common for well-known Vekllei models to end up in nude shoots either before or after their fame. Nudity is a little more common in Vekllei than it is in the U.S. (at beaches and so on), and that relaxes the moralising of smut somewhat.\nThat said, the generation previous to Tzipora\u0026rsquo;s (about 20 years prior, so around the early 2050s) were very sex-positive and deviant. Certain cultural iconography from this time is still used in porno \u0026ndash; heavy makeup, curled hair, bare thighs \u0026ndash; but this has prompted a conservatism among Tzipora\u0026rsquo;s generation towards the \u0026ldquo;vanity\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;superficiality\u0026rdquo; of their parents' sexual liberation and bare skin. Today it is much more common to have skirts below the knee than above it, and pornography is starting to shift to accommodate the fetishistic and fantasy as opposed to outright explicit desire common in the previous decades.\nforeign porno, however, is highly prized as a sort of racialised sexual unorthodoxy (especially of Asian or Black men and women, neither of whom are particularly large racial demographics in Vekllei). It\u0026rsquo;s rare to find and not commonly traded. There are very few bureaus that import pornography, and export is far more common.\n"});index.add({'id':78,'href':'/posts/2019-06-30-human-decay/','title':"The Principles of \"Human Decay\"",'section':"Archive",'content':"\rArchived from the original article here\r\rüå∏ Archived Post\nThis article predates the project, and should be considered non-canon.\r\r\rTalking about utopia in landscape is easy ‚Äî Vekllei is a glittering midcentury paradise that fosters human life as a wonderful dream.\nTalking about utopia in character is much harder. How can you find utopia in flawed and sometimes unattractive human beings? By what metric is the vague, intuitive values of a utopia measured against a living person?\nIn Upen, the nondenominational animism of Vekllei, there is the living principle of Dumousiantopet: ‚Äúbeautiful and seperate‚Äù. This is a modernist reconciliation of Vekllei‚Äôs striking, symmetrical and clean Newda architecture school with Upen‚Äôs otherwise modest and naturalistic principles. This makes fine sense for cities and towns, in which the triumphant and monumental nature of Vekllei architecture is at odds with Vekllei‚Äôs efforts to deindustrialise through post-scarcity, but it also applies to human beings, as natural objects, in society. In Vekllei, architecture is not adapted to its environment, but built in spite of it, as recognition of Vekllei‚Äôs human-centric worldview.\nSimultaneously, however, Vekllei is a land and people deeply linked with their surrounds, in which purpose and value is drawn from their landscape and nature is an intrinsic part of life. Dumousiantopet does not mean the domination of nature by human construction, but to exist together in segregation of their different systems of beauty.\n Hence the concept of ‚ÄòHuman Decay‚Äô, or Lemdisiandan, a system of human beauty that warps intuitive Western principles (the symmetrical woman, the rational man, the healthy boy, the cute girl, and so on) and worships instead decay, which in Vekllei is a positive natural process that unites all life, including landscape and human beings. Where Vekllei might build a utopian city to last a thousand years, human beauty is acknowledged to be far less eternal; it is in fact fleeting, at once suspended in a single moment and returning slowly to absence, or ‚Äònothingness‚Äô. In Vekllei, it it this process (and how it manifests) in which beauty is found. It is the evidence of life; the symptoms of living; the detail of imperfections in human beings that validate their place on Earth.\n A worn shirt, windswept hair, sweat on your brow ‚Äî small images of dignity and history in how a person talks and carries themselves.\nSo how does this manifest? Here is Tzipora Lo Ula Desmoines, a girl who suffers from Gregori-Heitzfeld Syndrome. She is a perfect example of character utopia:\n She is very shameful about her body and her thinness. She is angry at a lot of things and cannot let bad memories die. She suffers from hypertension after her childhood, and is terrified of dogs and loud noises. Bad dreams interrupt her sleep. She is distinctive but well-kept, productive but inward-facing. She is afflicted with nervous tics that manifest as shirt-pulling and nose-rubbing and has had them for many years. They appear involuntarily in nervousness and pointing them out to her will only increase their intensity. She has obsessions about clothing materials and the material composition of outfits, which can affect her emotionally (she cannot stand a wool skirt and rayon shirt, for example, intersecting). These bizarre principles include the proportion and length of items, and the tightness and looseness of clothes.  This list could go on and on to paint a very uncomfortable and invasive picture of an otherwise quiet and happy person, but these examples neglect the many wonderful things about her ‚Äî her affection and good sense of humour, her humility and loyalty, and so on. But while these good things might be employed to counteract the bad to us, to a Vekllei person they would accentuate and complete a complex and positive picture of a girl touched by ‚Äòhuman decay‚Äô, an ugly phrase in English that essentially refers to the sweet detail and intricacies that evidence the life of a person.\nHuman Decay does not glorify anxiety or mental illness ‚Äî nor does it worship dirtiness for the sake of being dirty, or imperfection for being imperfect ‚Äî but it does recognise the greatness in the texture and detail of human life. So it is that in Vekllei, splotchy birthmarks and soft skin alike are the characteristics of a beautiful person, and lend to a metric of beauty defined by storytelling and complexity.\n A lot of how Tzipora would be remembered would be in the way she appeared in the person. She was a good-looking young teen-ager of quiet and unusual movements. As she became known to the wider public, her physical appearance would come to define her as both a phenomena and disability ‚Äî a victim of blessings; a sweet child of cotton and gingham carrying on in the dark schism between teen-age impetuosity and the adult world of power. What a tragedy and miracle she was.Zelda, which was how she introduced herself among friends, was as intricate as she was indecipherable. She had her own internal logics; a unique carousel of intuition that marked her out as some unfortunate undamoispotet among other teen-agers. In conversation that stirred any emotion in her she was susceptible to spasmodic, defensive movements that distracted from her talking. Most frequently she would pull on her nose as if to wipe it, or reach for her shirt at the shoulder and adjust it. If she was particularly self-conscious, which could be brought on even by the spasms themselves, she would take hold of her shirt and keep her hand there, as though her thin girlish arms could shield her breast from judgement. She confided in her father that she did not like the tics. The more conscious of her imperfections she was, the more her idiosyncrasies flared. He asked her once how long she‚Äôd had them ‚Äî the nose rubbings, the shirt pullings ‚Äî and she said she couldn‚Äôt remember, but thought it might have been after she arrived in America. Which was possible, he supposed ‚Äî trauma could bring on tics, even laymen knew that. If you spend a while with her, however, it becomes more obvious that her tics are symptomatic of a nervous, fidgety subconscious not cowed by the supposed tomboyishness of her movements ‚Äî she jigs a leg, and run the back of her hand beneath her nose. Then, when she realises people notice those things and judge her for them, the same synchronistic hyperactivities became shirt-pulling and face-touching.\n Thanks folks.

The building was once a kindergarten, so they‚Äôd been told, but through decades of Vekllei‚Äôs irreverent planning it had become a caf√©. It was not a very good caf√©, the food was shit, but the building was nice and it was at the bottom of Lola‚Äôs steep residential hill. Locals struggling down it would pool at the bottom and inevitably step inside for a drink. In summer, the caf√© serves seasonal iced drinks to welcome a climate that has destroyed much of the world‚Äôs equatorial agriculture but has provided their arctic home a liveable summer. The girls dodge freckles and sip iced coffee as millions around the world flee encroaching deserts.\n The unstable Atlantic pressure oscillation, of which Vekllei anchors as the Vekllei low pole, can pull in bitter cold from the Greenland currents, or warmth from the Azores tempestuously.\nSo it is that in summer, on a beach of black igneous sand from the volcanoes of this place, hot rains can descend instantly and beat pedestrians until the rains vanish, minutes later. Winters are equally unstable ‚Äî they shift between unlivable cold and sporadic thawing periods.\n If you have ever spoken to a Vekllei person in English, you will notice an irritating habit of adding unnecessary vowels to words. ‚ÄòLoafer‚Äô becomes ‚Äúlowiefer‚Äù, ‚Äòa ciggie‚Äô becomes ‚Äúdes cigoirettenne‚Äù, and the concept of ‚Äòtrees‚Äô become ‚Äútres foliage‚Äù. This is an instinctual artefact of Vekllei talk, which incorporates vocal gestures to accompany physical ones, even in foreign words. It is also how ‚Äònakedity‚Äù‚Äôbecomes ‚ÄòNewda‚Äô, the dominant architectural school in Vekllei, found almost everywhere.\nAs a sort of post-deco modernism, it retains the striking geometry and vertical movement of more decadent architectural styles, but employs them conservatively to better reveal naked shape ‚Äî ‚Äònewda‚Äô. It is a flexible school that manifests differently depending on the utility of the building. Residential apartments, for example, often display elements reminiscent of constructivism, where national bureaus, or ‚Äòhard buildings‚Äô as they‚Äôre called in Vekllei, are more brutalistic. The stripped classicism of buildings of authority stands in stark contrast to the playful googie of utilities like phone booths and public restrooms. These allusions to grand midcentury architecture are domesticated with a unique form of Vekllei populuxe, usually because of Vekllei‚Äôs use of colour and shape as a language in itself.\nSome have called it a \u0026lsquo;Paris moderne\u0026rsquo; for the hegemony of the modernist bastards in Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s architecture schools, but to Vekllei people, these space-age visions of the future are home.\nyou can check my reddit profile (and there\u0026rsquo;s a follow button there now, because reddit is Facebook) for more posts about Vekllei and Tzipora.\n\rwww.vekllei.city or insta fer more.

The leftmost corpse, which was a boy, had a sign slung around his neck with tomorrow‚Äôs 8am train on it. Besides the swaying boy was his father, and next to him was his mother, and so it went down the railroad bridge, counting off his little sisters and grandmama and so on. The baby had been thrown in the creek. Who they were didn‚Äôt matter much, since the types of people hanging from bridges and trees and lampposts were cut from the same cloth.\nLater that night, a man from the Kennecott Copper Company payed a sum of four and a half million dollars in cheque towards three bastards, two pigs and a thug. For that sort of money, you could buy a home to the North and the East, far out of Utah and far out of the violence. Not that any of them would leave ‚Äî the pigs had good jobs with the Sheriff‚Äôs office, the bastards had been born here and would die here, and, well, the thug just liked killing too much.\nYou could trace today‚Äôs nightmare back to the collapse of the Ford Motor Company, but there were problems in the southwest long before even that. The truth of it is that there‚Äôs been a lot of anger in Utah for a long time, it\u0026rsquo;s just taken a lot longer than anyone thought it would.\n It‚Äôs quite impossible to imagine the tragedy of the U.S. in 2094, where suffering can be predicted by the latitude at which it occurs and midcentury domesticity collides with violence and power. As the U.S. Dollar inflates wildly and the Atomic Age has priced out the working man, is it any wonder that Southerners waste away beneath horizons of the quiet, rusting manufacturing plants of the southwest, where the wind whistles between conveyors once carrying bits of Pontiacs and Fords?\nWhat we saw, as the Dallas Accords failed and the talks of a total secession ascended from fantasy, was the rise of militias, company cities, industrial action, bloodshed, lynchings, racial animosity, the death of suburbs, mass killings, child labour, sexual violence, decaying infrastructure, and so on. The air was electric with opportunity to live out your wildest, most depraved fantasies. Bizarre images of single-story cul-de-sacs and a half-dozen State police excavating portions of desert existed simultaneously. The free flow of immigrants between Mexico and Arizona was quickly seized upon and exploited by companies like Anaconda Mineral and Kennecott Copper, who filled their mines with Latin Americans to shut out striking workers.\nAn immigrant labourer was dead at the signing of his contract. He was killed by vigilantes, or in a mine accident, or was simply consumed, since these people did not have names and the companies had no expectations of their longevity. That attitude soon came to shadow almost every interaction between otherwise decent people of impoverished communities ‚Äî that there was no future, that they were the last generation, that the hedonistic cycle of production and consumption had become life itself.\nThe hedonism of brutality and modern pornography manifested in the violence of the company militias and local sheriffs alike, and so both cannibalism and necrophilia were widespread in oft-secret killings. Desecration of corpses, mutilation of the living, and widespread lawlessness came to characterise the hell that was life in the southern U.S. in 2094. How terrifying it was that beautiful things could decay so quickly.\nSo it was that men became creatures ‚Äî lust became necrophilic, suffering became ecstasy. This mad spiral towards our worst instincts came out in full force. The biopolitics of life and consumption became the necropolitics of grotesqueing and subsumption. A girl‚Äôs sandal; poisoned bread; leaded cosmetics; copper in the mountains; apricot phosphorous on the horizon; a nuclear family in the current; six Mexicans gutted; six good boys killing for cash; whole towns cashing in and shipping out.\nThat is life in Utah today.

About half have dark hair and rounder faces, as descendants of both inuits and Scandinavians, and others are of mixed ancestry. Families in Vekllei are large and often nonbiological, and a single lad can have a dozen sisters. Ame Louisendopet might be a bitch on occasion, but that‚Äôs how it goes. Jo‚Äôs little sister, Popet, has decided age ten and a half that she‚Äôll be a locomotive engineer one day.\n As you may have learned by now, Vekllei is a land of contrasts. Last year, the Lonne Rail Authority commissioned a new generation of maglev trains for blistering five-minute commutes between Little Vekllei and the Lonne terminus, turning an otherwise 60km journey into an unconscious gesture. At a top speed of 750km/h, the pride of Vekllei‚Äôs commuter rail seems to gunning for subsonic commuter jets head-on.\nMeanwhile, in the mountains around Montre, the D-006 steam locomotive approaches her 130th birthday. Where the maglev guzzles direct current from atomic power plants around the country, D-006 chews through bunker fuel ‚Äî literal scrapings from a barrel somewhere ‚Äî and leaves soot where she goes. Her train is not carrying businessfolk but log cars bound for the coasts, where they will be sold to Europe for furniture. In the mornings of most weekdays, the engineers and lumberjacks that man her bring their children along for the trip, where the little ones watch the engineer work the cab while the teenagers shiver on her maintenance catwalks.\nShe is dirty, slow, and makes absolutely no sense occupying a route in the space age, one marked by moon colonies and new empire. What is going on here?\nThings begin to make a little more sense through the lens of an ordinary Vekllei person, with their own bizarre domestic intuition and frame of mind. Like we talked about previously, Vekllei understands the the achievements of industry as a liberationist tool to return to preindustrial, satisfying life. It is not as though the country will ‚Äòundo‚Äô three centuries of tremendous progress ‚Äî quite the contrary, in fact. But understood through petticoat ideology, the marriage of labour and the ordinary person can only occur through self-satisfying, personal work. This is in contrast, one can suppose, to mechanised, industrial labour to which we owe our enormous wealth. To a Vekllei person, work is social, productive, creative and satisfying. The simple pleasures of agriculture; specialised craftsman and tradesman; artistry ‚Äî these are the fruits only of a society that can afford them, since they necessitate the deindustrialisation of agriculture, factory manufacturing and mass media simultaneously.\nThe steam locomotive is ultimately a fetishisation of this sort of thinking ‚Äî it is an analogue machine, complicated while comprehensible to the ordinary person (unlike, say, atomic energy or even gas-turbine locomotives). It is enormous and impressive, and also nostalgic for many Vekllei people. In a place and time where money did not matter, as it does not in Vekllei, and productivity was an afterthought, as it is in Vekllei, they make perfect sense. These ‚Äòimages‚Äô; of rural labour assisted by steam locomotives; of children growing up with these machines; of the constant fetishisation and decommodification of the world ‚Äî these are currency in Vekllei. That is why this useless machine is a wonderful machine, and why a handful of steam locomotives mother their respective communities decades after their obsolescence.\nyou can check my reddit profile (and there\u0026rsquo;s a follow button there now, because reddit is Facebook) for more posts about Vekllei and Tzipora.\n\rwww.vekllei.city or insta fer more.

The effects of long-term childhood and social isolation are far more profound on the personality of a Gregori child than any biological limitation or squabbling about the teen-age/adult schism.\nBoys can also have it, but are always hyperallergic and suffer from a broad anaphylaxis at onset of the condition (usually a little earlier, in early thelarche at 8-10y/o). It will almost always kill them. The discrepancy between the sexes is still being researched.\nGirls also have a risk of developing hyperallergies. Gregori babies have never developed cancers as far as anyone is aware, and these hyperallergies are a result of this hyperactive immune system.\nGregori babies fulfill the first of two miracles required for sainthood in the Catholic Church. In other parts of the world they are targets of violence as practicers of witchcraft or demonic pacts. The oldest Gregori baby, Tzipora Desmoines, is 120 years old and is set to overtake the human lifespan. She was 13th overall to have been diagnosed, but Gregori children have high mortality rates (largely violence, car accidents and suicides) and she is the first to pass 60 years of age. So, somewhat ironically, the children with speculated immortality almost always die young.\nKnowing her\r#\r\rA lot of how Tzipora would be remembered would be in the way she appeared in the person. She was a good-looking young teen-ager of quiet and unusual movements. As she became known to the wider public, her physical appearance would come to define her as both a phenomena and disability ‚Äî a victim of blessings; a sweet child of cotton and gingham carrying on in the dark schism between teen-age impetuosity and the adult world of power. What a tragedy and miracle she was.\nZelda, which was how she introduced herself among friends, was as intricate as she was indecipherable. She had her own internal logics; a unique carousel of intuition that marked her out as some unfortunate undamoispotet among other teen-agers. In conversation that stirred any emotion in her she was susceptible to spasmodic, defensive movements that distracted from her talking. Most frequently she would pull on her nose as if to wipe it, or reach for her shirt at the shoulder and adjust it. If she was particularly self-conscious, which could be brought on even by the spasms themselves, she would take hold of her shirt and keep her hand there, as though her thin girlish arms could shield her breast from judgement. She confided in her father that she did not like the tics. The more conscious of her imperfections she was, the more her idiosyncrasies flared. He asked her once how long she‚Äôd had them ‚Äî the nose rubbings, the shirt pullings ‚Äî and she said she couldn‚Äôt remember, but thought it might have been after she arrived in America. Which was possible, he supposed ‚Äî trauma could bring on tics, even laymen knew that. If you spend a while with her, however, it becomes more obvious that her tics are symptomatic of a nervous, fidgety subconscious not cowed by the supposed tomboyishness of her movements ‚Äî she jigs a leg, and run the back of her hand beneath her nose. Then, when she realises people notice those things and judge her for them, the same synchronistic hyperactivities became shirt-pulling and face-touching.\nI love questions, so please let me know if you have any!

It sits on the slope of the wide Vekllei capital basin, where the Atlantic can be seen from the street. It was Tzipora\u0026rsquo;s first home in Vekllei, and it was where she lived with her father. The schools were good, the kids were all right, and the trams were a gift from Christ.\nMost of Vekllei looks like Lola, marked by her mid-rise streets and public thermal ponds and geyser baths (named after the Vekllei village of Geyser, as it happens). Vekllei people do not generally own cars, and mostly commute via the metro, the exhaustive tram network or on occasion in a loan car from the autopool. The streets are narrow and empty of traffic save for service vehicles, and in the summers they are invaded by neighbourhood children playing baseball or seeking shade under the street trees.\nLola is one of hundreds of neighbourhoods in the vast, densely-populated capital of the country from which it aquires its namesake. It is a city facing its past, now that there is plenty to eat and little to do \u0026ndash; and as a sprawling urban utopia with a fierce nostalgia for preindustrial life, there is no other place like it on Earth. Caught at once between the future of space and helijets, and her collective memories of agriculture and simple labour, Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s petticoat society marks a departure from futurism and a turn to its history, as though the violence and suffering and chaos of the past three centuries were but a chore obstructing utopia.\nParticipatory Economics \u0026amp; Property\r#\r\rIn Vekllei‚Äôs feminised parpolity, the revitalisation of Upen brought about an ancient understanding of property reborn in the widespread poverty of Vekllei society following the first Atomic War. Widespead social regression and cross-generational nostalgia for preindustrial life took hold in urban Vekllei society almost immediately after the atomic fire, as the ruins of colonial and imperial society lay around the Vekllei people. The monarchy, a tokenistic and fashionable invention of the gilded Mercantile age just three centuries before, evaporated nearly overnight with the death of the king. So, too, did the military junta salivating over the charred remains of the capital find it nearly impossible to consolidate power in a city now without infrastructure. In the ashes of modern industrialisation grew tempered, atomised communities of streets and villages ‚Äî the common council as we see it today. Food production returned to the city in the ruins of vast factories, wide canals were dug for unmotorised barges, and councils of working people organised self-interest in these communities, which would be understood a century later as Sundress Municipalism. So too did the common understanding of property evaporate.\nThe old libertarian bugbear of the origins of property was revived ‚Äî the population had been decimated, Vekllei people were surrounded by vast swaths of useless land of deceased ownership, and the institutions of old society had failed to retake power following the war. The question of ownership was pertinent, as it would clarify the sovereigns of future society. The sovereignty of Vekllei, as it would later be determined, is decentralised and portioned between any land-operating individual, local organisations, municiple councils, and syndicates. This tradition carries on today. In any one apartment building or row-house, you will find the inhabitants, building administrators, local councils and tenant unions exercising types of ownership over a space. In other words; residents of a home will have implied ownership over a home, but a community has implied ownership over the community itself. The intersection of different kinds of ownership result in complex and partially uncoded laws that, although vulnerable to beaurocratic and exhaustive legal disputes, are mostly discarded in place of local opinion.\nThe foundation of the Vekllei political and economic system is the community; a population larger than a single family and small enough to have valuable social bonds; a group of people bound by common living, work, and recreation. An unruly or criminal tenant is more likely to be run out of town by his neighbours than by the courts. This is not to misrepresent the daily conflicts of Vekllei domestic society ‚Äî disputes are common and meaningless. But abuse of common ownership is tempered by the fact that it is quite impossible to evict any individual from his home without overwhelming agreement of his neighbours, essentially relegating formal council ownership to irrelevency; the true owners of any single home are, in practice, the community in which it is situated, supervised by protections offered under the local judicial councils.\nThe ownership of a factory is a lot more straightforward ‚Äî the old mantra of the democratic workplace is more or less true here. Principally, unautomated (manned) factories recieve production requests from one of the hundreds of different economic bureaus keeping stock of production in the country, which otherwise do not directly supervise production except in circumstance of scarcity. Production requests are voluntary, and usually formalities in the production of items for local consumption. Heavily centralised industries, particularly heavy industries like raw product extraction and refining, usually operate under direct supervision of a bureau. Unions exist independently of the bureau system and usually hold membership from every worker of a factory, including managers. Mirroring nested councils, there are also larger industry unions that generally involve themselves only in general strikes and legal cases without precedent.\nThe ownership of a grocery store is clear and implied, if not codified. The person who manages and works the shop, either through implied property bonding (so-called ‚Äòfolk morality‚Äô; a phenomena largely dependent on the person‚Äôs social value and local consent) or familial tradition, owns the shop. These are not lawful protections of ownership ‚Äî indeed, Vekllei common law says very little about senrouive business ownership ‚Äî but in almost every case, they are validated by a community intuitively. Even antisocial or hostile shop-owners are rarely challenged on their right to the property they manage ‚Äî the shop is, technically speaking, seen as an extension of the natural landscape (as no more than fired clay and timber), and the live-and-let-live culture in Vekllei is sympathetic to leaving people to their business and shop elsewhere. Legal disputes on the right to live above and manage a store are relatively rare, and usually resolved through ‚Äòblood rights‚Äô ( similar to ‚Äòfolk morality‚Äô) in the case of an individual or in a more democratic fashion involving multiple relevant complainants, like employees. In both of these examples, the disputed property is considered an entity itself with its own rights and interests extrapolated from its history and surrounding landscape.\nHerein remains the distinction between venrouiva/senrouive property, and their implied ownership. Venrouiva usually operate in cooperation with the product bureaus in the case of manufacturing, or other national organisations as their industry requires in education, medicine, power, water, etc. They are ultimately beholden to the direction of the country, as organised by the seats of power and politics. Senrouive exists somewhat independent of the economy entirely, recieving mostly what it asks for and immersing their respective economies in the communities around them. Although all physical material in Vekllei is ultimately property of the country (a vague, naturalistic construct seen as distinct from the government, at least in a Western understanding), senrouivewill almost never be managed directly by larger unions or administrative bodies. This distinction does little to articulate public and private ownership, as the very concept of property remains formally unacknowledged in the economy in the country. Instead, all business today is conducted in cooperation with the ideas of community, implied ownership, self-interest and some sort of idea of supply and demand largely usurped by post-scarcity and widespread automation.\nBecause of this, Vekllei does not actually consider itself classless ‚Äî Indeed, venrouiva are fundamentally a coordinating class of workers that are atomised from senrouive work through their power and decision-making. They are a class of power in law, education, science, medicine, and politics, and consequently, guide the direction of the country. Although even senrouive business is still fundamentally worker-owned and managed (as part of Sundress Municipalism), this hierarchy remains in principle, even if the quality of life of venrouiva and senrouive workers is in practice identical. This fact is rarely acknowledged outside of technical circles in the country, because it matters very little to the common Vekllei person. Vekllei is not outwardly egalitarian, despite practice, and the problems of power are mitigated by a mess of democratic structures ultimately enslaved to self-interested, independent communities of people. For one of the most centralised countries in the world, with a homogenous ethnic people and culture, Vekllei is better described as hundreds of thousands of hamlets than a single city.\nthis section is continued on my website: www.vekllei.city.

They do not eat and will live forever, provided they stay within the gardens of the Palace and consummate their industrial godhood occasionally with domen, an opium that they believe purifies blood.\nAdult Palace Gods are almost entirely women, but birthrates of boys and girls are about equal. At the onset of puberty, boys can enter rituals to become female gods, but sexual pleasure will stain their transition and thus romentet (as they‚Äôre called in god-tongue) will never maintain blood parity with female Palace Gods. Boys who enter sexual acts or allow sexual thoughts will not transition correctly and instead be consigned to serfdom for the rest of their lives (and in the impurities of their blood, they will be dead by forty).\nThe intersection of the Palace hierarchy and immortality mean that adult Palace Gods are terrified of deposition by younger generations. Older gods will often take an oath of chastity or, failing that, attempt to sabotage the blood purity of god-children to ensure they do not grow up to threaten their positions of power. Adult women often enter relationships with boys for this reason, which will prevent their transition and rise to power and instead grant them mortality. Young girls, however, cannot be dispossessed of their powers so easily. Homosexuality is strictly forbidden in the Palace, and so girls are often tricked into destroying their potential in rituals known as bloodfits.\nAs inhabitants of the Palace do not need to eat, it means that they do not consume the souls of other creatures. According to their own tapestry myth, their spiritual veganism has come to be a core lifestyle on which godhood is predicated. Young goddesses are often curious about mortal pleasures like food and body functions, and so particularly manipulative adult gods will trick them into eating meat and thus consuming the soul of another creature. After the meat is consumed (the quantity rarely matters, so long as the goddess in general understands they have eaten it), their sin is revealed to them and that knowledge sparks a spiritual crisis in the young goddess that collapses their powers and their physical presence in the Palace.\nWhere they go is unknown to anyone still living in the Palace ‚Äî to those unfortunate girls tricked into bloodfit, they find themselves in a land not quite Pachinki (the mortal planet) or the Palace (the central harbour for gods). Instead, there exists a realm constructed of young gods‚Äô ideas of what mortal life might be like, complete with the idealism and fear of the unknown beyond their Palace lifestyles. They begin to breathe for the first time ‚Äî a terrifying experience to a goddess previously unused to it ‚Äî and will experience weather, texture, and sunlight for the first time. Their clothes will suddenly have weight, and their wings are now vestigial relics of magic-aided flight. Many girls simply pass out, unable to deal with the shock of reality.\nMost stories here end happily though, in a trend unusual for Pachinki and the Palace. The in-between world these goddesses find themselves in is constructed of their hope and curiosity of Pachinki, too. Green pastures of stunning colour and flower-meadows straight out of their wildest fantasies are never far away. A community of ex-goddesses actively look for new girls and help them integrate into the material world. With time, the Palace life simply doesn‚Äôt compare.\nUloah, pictured here, is one of the most recent goddesses to be tricked into committing bloodfit. She was unwittingly fed her own pet peacock, and ended up in the salt lakes of the in-between realm. Any god trying to eat for the first time is a messy affair. After a day of desperate tears and despair as she wandered aimlessly, she came across two beautiful goddesses about her age in Palace clothes. They took her to a village with homes made of long grass populated entirely by her kin. A life of pressures and treachery in the Palace was replaced with the simple pleasures of quiet agriculture and play.\nSo why is so much of the magic of the Palace Gods predicated on myth and tradition? After all, it is not a potion or gemstone that strips goddesses of their power. The truth of it, understood by very few and acknowledged by fewer, is that the Palace Gods are sustained entirely by their own myth, with no future or past.\nPrincess Torah, the revolutionary ex-goddess that would eventually liberate the mortal Pachinki from the Palace, said as such in her early writings:\n The Palace Gods are not gods because of bloodlines, despite their insistence. They will tell you it is hereditary, and that blood is colloquial for purity, but they are misunderstanding their own myths. They preach immortality, but can be slaughtered like failing livestock if you‚Äôd only realise it. They are not gods because they are better equipped to employ ancient magic, or because they have unlocked the secret of eternal life. They are gods because they‚Äôve fallen for the fiction that sustains them ‚Äî they are monarchs because they believe in the monarchy, they are cruel because they believe in cruelty, and they subjugate because that is how they‚Äôve read the elaborate tapestry their ancestors constructed. So when Princess Moswen, my martyr and humanist sister (rest her soul), descended to the human people and addressed them universally without regard to race or subcontinent, she called the Gods what they were ‚Äî tokens writing simultaneously their past and future, failing their own present. Waxen, pastel nepotists misunderstanding their fiction as constitution.\n -\u0026mdash;-\nPachinki isn\u0026rsquo;t a normal constructed world. It has its own canon.

They didn‚Äôt tell it to Rena like that, but that‚Äôs what happened to him. His village and people, the Lehmanen, are descendants of Palace Gods forced out of the heavens some millennia ago over their refusal to smoke Domen, a sort of opium of the Gods and essential practice in the Palace.\nAs descendants of Palace Gods, many still carry birthstones in their bodies ‚Äî small gems buried in the heart of the gut, beneath the stomach. These birthstones are very powerful magical artefacts and fetch a high price in Pachinki‚Äôs larger and less magical kingdoms. Rena‚Äôs little boy, who was not yet ten, had been taken by pirates looking for his stone and killed. The great tragedy of it was that he was fathered by a man from Zen ‚Äî the boy had not inherited a birthstone from his mother.\nHe was her only child and she‚Äôd been widowed in the war. The chief of their village announced a month of mourning and fasting in his memory. Once the period had passed, life went on. Rena resumed work in the mineral swamps in which Lehmanen live. The roots and algae that grow in these waters sustain communal village life and produce potions of medicinal value, including leprosy and tuberculosis vaccines.\nTwo months after the murder of her only child, Rena came across a stone that struck her dumb with shock. It was her boy‚Äôs face, unmistakeable in the perfection of the diorite, caught in the terror and pain of his final moments. It hadn‚Äôt been there the month before. She waded over to it but found no other indication of its origin.\nThat boy was only the first. As more people died, and the village went through its cycles of joy and grief, the swamp slowly began to fill with the forms of the dead. Heads of the fog. The Lehmanen were confused and angry by the insensitivity of the mineral swamp, and couldn‚Äôt understand why it was happening. Something was intercepting the quiet grief of these isolated people and resurrecting the memory of the dead. Was it the minerals? The wind? Something beneath the waters? Was it even a phenomena so simple as to assign to a single force of nature?\nNearly a year after the death of Rena‚Äôs little boy, another head appeared, joining dozens already hidden in the fog of the mineral swamps. This one was identical to the diorite totems before it. But it was unique.\nThis one was of Rena ‚Äî and she was very much alive.\nPrevious posts here and here.\n‚Äî\nThe Pachinki pangea is home to six subcontinents of old magic, mostly inherited from the Palace Gods, who are worshipped by urban centres to this day. The Lem subcontinent is sparsely populated, as the minerals of its many swamps are rife with disease (an illness contracted here, of which there are many, are called plaguentart in Lem or honeydeath in the Zen tongue).\nThe Lem are ignorant of the much older magic of the swamps, which predates perhaps even the Palace itself. As stupid to it as they are ultraviolets, the people of Pachinki can only react to the manifestations of it, and will never harness the raw, low-frequency power of ancient harmonics.\n‚Äî Footnotes ‚Äî\nPachinki is the creation of a fourteen-year-old girl in my world, Vekllei.\n So Pachinki occasionally lurches into horror otherwise incongruous with the sweet fantasy Tzipora shows such affection for. Pachinki may be a world of peace and wonder, but just like Tzipora‚Äôs own present utopian surrounds, it belies a historical context of starvation, mass graves and political violence. Part of the wonder of Pachinki, looking back, is that Tzipora seemed keenly aware of the prohibitively dark nature of this kind of violence in her otherwise escapist whimsy, and this maternal turbulence with her own work is so obvious that even the most casual reader will be conscious of its inconsistency. A page about the pleasure of tasting fruit gems will pirouette into musings on the use of slavery in their procurement and the sabotaging of their production to justify conquest and war. The surreal dissonance of her own motivations for creating Pachinki reflect a girl who was herself living a surreal, contradictory existence ‚Äî at her time of writing, she was living in a land of plenty and peace, where just a year before she was nearly killed after grocers in Cherry started poisoning their food waste to drive away homeless and vagrants. Her own existence was one of startling contrast ‚Äî a rapid transition to petticoat society from the misery of the American South, where she witnessed indiscriminate slaughter, sexual violence and crippling poverty. Whatever hurts is real, and so Vekllei did not feel real to her ‚Äî and consequently, Pachinki is suspended in the same internal turmoil.\n Pachinki isn\u0026rsquo;t a normal constructed world.

The horizon beyond was warped, caught in the distortion of a forested planetoid before them. The morning sun cast a honeyed warmth on her wings of black sugar, which sang like wind chimes as she soared high above the gem deserts below. Hyssop, her new and only friend, followed her ungracefully under the spell of his flystone.\nA chill caught her skull and traced her veins to her stomach, where it seized up. She felt the strength go from her wings and the world tilt out of focus. Her body plummeted, her figure limp, and Hyssop yelled out at her, ‚ÄúPrincess! Tora! What‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù\nHer wings trailed her as she fell from the sky, and he dived after her. The sparkle of the sand blinded them as the gems rose into view. They hit the dune in a plume of rubies.\nShe awoke and emerged from his arms. He was beneath her, dazed in the crash.\n‚ÄúHyssop!‚Äù She screamed. ‚ÄúHyssop, I‚Äôm sorry!

She could admire nothing in her fear. Her knees and palms were pitted with gems and wept blood.\n‚ÄúHyssop,‚Äù she whispered from the corner of her mouth, her face in the sun. A whimper caught in her throat and it coloured her voice. ‚ÄúWhat are those men?‚Äù\n‚ÄúHenchmen of the Palace Gods. They‚Äôre looking for you.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI‚Äôll kill myself, before I go back.

Of course, the henchmen come from the heavens and are summoned for singular purposes, usually surveillance or sabotage. Tzipora was always very clear on the limitations of the Palace Gods, and their struggles to enter the mortal world, a weakness that inhibited the successful recapture of their runaway princess, Tora. In fact, Tora‚Äôs ability to enter the mortal world without the collapse of her mind, as dictated by the schism between planes, was more shocking in itself than her youthful betrayal. In many ways, Tora is a self-insert that witnesses much of the tragedy Tzipora had to come to terms with and rationalise in her early years in the American South. In this context, the Pinkerton moniker makes sense in Tzipora‚Äôs mind ‚Äî just as Tora later attempts to organise Pachinki into a revolt against the Gods (with brutal suppression on the part of the henchmen), Tzipora herself witnessed bloody strikebreaking several times as she rode freight trains on Southern Pacific, a freight company that experienced violent industrial action shortly before its bankruptcy.\n And further;\n So Pachinki occasionally lurches into horror otherwise incongruous with the sweet fantasy Tzipora shows such affection for. Pachinki may be a world of peace and wonder, but just like Tzipora‚Äôs own present utopian surrounds, it belies a historical context of starvation, mass graves and political violence.

Her own existence was one of startling contrast ‚Äî a rapid transition to petticoat society from the misery of the American South, where she witnessed indiscriminate slaughter, sexual violence and crippling poverty. Whatever hurts is real, and so Vekllei did not feel real to her ‚Äî and consequently, Pachinki is suspended in the same internal turmoil.\n "});index.add({'id':91,'href':'/posts/2019-03-10-fortress/','title':"The Sugarhouse Mountain Fortress",'section':"Archive",'content':"\rArchived from the original article here\r\rüå∏ Archived Post\nThis article predates the project, and should be considered non-canon.\r\r\rA hundred years ago, the fortress existed as a spectre of the neighbouring villages; a beast of suffering and woe with fingers deep into the mountains around Montre. In the waning days of the military junta, the beast‚Äôs creators, the Sugarhouse Fort served as a strategic command centre for Vekllei‚Äôs nuclear arsenal and a blacksite to disappear the most prolific and dangerous agitators.\nThe Fort was not finished when the bombs fell, and it sat abandoned for a half-century as the scorched fragments of Vekllei society were preoccupied with their total devastation. It was not until Vekllei‚Äôs reemergence as a great power, and one that was convinced of an imminent nuclear war, that the Fort was reoccupied as one of the largest buried forts in the world, rivalled only by the Moscow Metro complex and Cheyenne Mountain‚Äôs extensions in the late 2080s.\nThe Fort is no longer a spectre of the nearby villages ‚Äî in fact, commute between them is so regular that a special railway has been installed into the heart of the fort, where many thousands of locals work as labourers, switchboard operators, engineers, administrators and research scientists. The fort houses Vekllei‚Äôs international telephone exchange, her largest geothermal research outfit attached to Montre University, Vekllei‚Äôs nuclear command buried deep in the ganglia of the fort, the auxiliary national railway control, Vekllei‚Äôs fourth-largest nuclear shelter system, and many other bureaus of national importance that have been relocated away from the capital city in fear of their destruction there.\nThe high-frequency telephonics and radar suck so much power that they would cause blackouts in nearby towns if they were both activated at the same time. As a modern all-electric fort with complex electrified munitions transport systems and pumps, her power plants are modern and overhauled every decade or so.\nTwo supercritical hydrothermic geothermal power plants at opposite ends of the fort operate as primary sources of power. In other countries they would be prohibitively expensive \u0026ndash; high-temperature geothermal sources have a high failure rate and require extraordinarily complex infrastructure to construct. These two plants (Suzie East and Ame West) have wells nearly five kilometres deep (just over 16,100ft), and capitalise on the plate margins of the European and American tectonic plates, which Vekllei straddles.\nThe fort is inherently outdated in an age of thermonuclear weaponry (although her shelters deep below the Earth are estimated to be impenetrable even to several direct strikes), but Vekllei is not a large country and the viability of mobilised command for civilian bureaus, like that found U.S. and the Soviet Union, is limited. The country has an affection for infrastructure, a fact of no surprise to anyone who has been there, and it is the size of the fort, and its decentralised network of tunnels throughout much of the Montre-Sugarhouse mountain range, that serve as primary defences in the face of a second nuclear war.\n This image here is a \u0026lsquo;pocket\u0026rsquo; telegram signed with love. The fort is one of the largest construction projects of the last two centuries, and is a point of pride among the people of the North. In all their agrarian and peaceful living, Sugarhouse Fort has no equal in anything in the industrious South of the country.\n -\u0026ndash;\nthanks for stopping by. www.vekllei.city fer more. follow me on reddit or insta for all that good vekllei shit\nPlease let me know if you have any questions!\n"});index.add({'id':92,'href':'/posts/2019-02-26-generation/','title':"The Forgotten Generation",'section':"Archive",'content':"\rArchived from the original article here\r\rüå∏ Archived Post\nThis article predates the project, and should be considered non-canon.\r\r\rWe best know Vekllei as a dense society of utopia and great infrastructure today, but there was blood in that crucible. It is difficult to imagine that only fifty years ago these streets were unpaved and impassible with the rubble of old society. Shadows on concrete marked the souls lost in the arrogance of the monarchy. The nuclear fire was pregnant with a new generation of people, who, in the principles of upen, would forge a new society out of the ruins of the old.\n Back then girl‚Äôs shirts weren‚Äôt made of cotton and you wore holes in your shoes. He was part of the budoinetnoikotet, or the ‚Äòwar children‚Äô. His parents had lived through the first atomic war, and he was the born in the shadow of it.\nIn that time the currency had completely collapsed, and so people traded within their own communities in an awkward return to preindustrial life. Often, people‚Äôs best clothes were their uniforms, and so that was what they took photos in. This photo sits on the commode in the living room, next to a vase of lilies.\nHe remembered sour details of his teen-age impetuosity. How he insisted he remove his glasses for the photo, insulting his bespectacled father in doing so. How his mother argued with his sister over the appropriate length of her fountain hairpiece. The women wore their family gi, ceremonial quarter-pleats, and he\u0026rsquo;d had his hair cut.\nHe thought a lot about his sister, Amelie. She was beautiful and clever and had a weird sense of humour. He‚Äôd loved her a lot. She confided in him as teen-agers‚Äî about problems with friends, her rampant insecurities, her dreams of the future. It turned out she‚Äôd had a beast in her lungs and it took her when she was fifteen. That was how it went back then, in the poverty of the city. To think a hundred years earlier tuberculosis had been a rumour. That is what war does to a country. He was not even afforded the dignity of anger. The English had been right to bomb them.\nLife was different now, of course. Vekllei was strong, and although he was not much wealthier, there was more to be had. The country had flourished in the ruins of the old society. Now he watches his own child sport the uniform his sister once wore, and when she smiles at him she looks like Amelie.\n Vekllei developed rapidly in the face of total destruction. In the space of fifty years the country consolidated infrastructure and its rural population into a powerful city-state of autonomous, rugged agrarian hamlets, they themselves flowers of the extinct monarchy and military junta. In some ways it was an exciting time to be alive \u0026ndash; there was now plenty to be had. No-one was hungry. But the children of those interim years have almost been erased from common memory entirely, as bastards of Vekllei\u0026rsquo;s story of utopia and violence.\nThanks for stopping by.

She was very conscious of the fact that she was living as a traitor to her old friends. If she was going to die in a nuclear blast ‚Äî so be it. It would finally be repaid. She had lived a wonderful life these last couple years and had made good use of her borrowed time.\nWhen the war did come, as she always had suspected it would, she was prepared to die in it. She was caught outside when the bomb hit Montre, and when it failed to kill her, she spent three days searching tirelessly for wounded with the rest of the Civil Defense corps. It was only when her legs gave out that she made the long journey back to her father in the capital, to reassure him that she was in fact still alive.\nShe was awarded for her efforts, along with two others from Montre-Lola.

In places where the soil is too thin for heavy wheats, sparrowgrass is grown. This grass has large heads that can be eaten raw and taste citrusy and acidic as they only grow in toxic soils.\nBattered by gem storms, where holy winds pick up stones from the deserts and scatter them, the people of Zen live a hard and honest life. They have forsaken Palace Gods, and have consequently lost a lot of their fertility. Since marriage is dissolved upon failure of a child, Zen has many lonely and desperate spinsters. Driven nearly mad by their childlessness, it is possible to give birth to ‚Äògem children‚Äô by crushing certain magic gemstones and consuming that powder with normal edible fruit gems. After a short labour of about a month, an extraordinarily painful pregnancy precedes a dangerous birth that kills about half of gem-pregnant women.\nThe child is undeniably beautiful ‚Äî with a perfect colour and a glitter like no other, gem children are otherwise just like you or me. They usually find themselves popular among other village children as objects of wonder. In poorer Zen regions beyond the large wheat kingdoms, they are targets for pirates who whisk them away in airships and sell them to slavers on mainland Pachinki, since gem children are prized as well-groomed, beautiful servants of the aristocracy. This is somewhat misguided, as the majority of gem children that live in Zen live an unglamorous, happy life in agriculture.\nThey are extremely strong ‚Äî with nearly no limit to their ability to push and crush ‚Äî but are easily threatened by frequencies that shatter gems. One can easily hold themselves up with a single finger. They move gracefully though and have universally fine motor skills, so they have never harmed a fleshed human unintentionally. Grace here is caught mid-leap to a single handstand. With her fine balance and limitless energy, she could stay there forever if she chooses.\nGem children are kept alive by love, and as long as they are loved by someone ‚Äî their mother, the community, friends ‚Äî they will live forever. They also grow up, and stop physically ageing in their early twenties. Tragically, many gem children that are kidnapped die soon after as they are thrust into unloving environments.\nMarried gem children often move abroad with their partners, since their appearance makes them popular fortune-tellers, spell-casters or oath-breakers.\nGem deserts are mesmerising and a joy to wander, but you must only walk with a low sun or at night. Even in a bright moonlight, the brilliance of the gems can easily blind you for days, sometimes forever. They symbolise Zen as a people and as a landscape, and are one of the oldest shifting monuments on Pachinki.\n--\nPachinki isn\u0026rsquo;t a normal constructed world. It has its own canon.

Although a walk in the capital will take you past colossal apartment blocks and cinemas, libraries and schools of great magnificence, you are really looking at a hundred different communities going about personal business at their leisure. The villages are large and concrete now, but the people are are still there.\nSo does it surprise anyone that the police are just as much caregivers as law enforcement? That‚Äôs the thing about cultural matriarchy ‚Äî even old moustachioed crustaceans like Teddy Roresoin here are mothers in the consciousness of the country.\nTeddy came from shipbuilders and he was desperate to avoid becoming his parents. He enlisted in the Navy, but at university his politics soured on dying in some hole in Taiwan and he returned to his seaside prefecture. His office in the station overlooks the dry dock where his parents once worked. In his day it birthed large trawlers of fatty Atlantic salmon. Today it makes nuclear submarines.\nHe didn‚Äôt mean to have a child, much less a daughter, and she turned out to be everything he was terrified of. In Vekllei, they are called ‚ÄòLodoinopotet‚Äô, which fits into English best as ‚Äòwoman-girls‚Äô or \u0026lsquo;girly girl\u0026rsquo;. It evokes a specific image ‚Äî a high-school girl with modified uniform, enamoured by useless trinkets like perfume and rouge.\nMay, his daughter, was not always close with her father but her mother did not stick around long and so it was how it was. She did not intend to become a police officer in school. She spent most of her schooling life having her heart broken by a whirlwind of paper friendships and easy boyfriends. With no qualifications and mediocre grades, she asked her father for a job. She found out she liked it, and the people she policed liked her, too. These days she patrols their hometown together with her father, killing time and making friends. She used to wear makeup heavy like the inner-city girls. She was ashamed of a beauty mark near her mouth. Nowadays it doesn‚Äôt bother her much.\nOne of her favourite of the town‚Äôs children is Laura and her brother Rike, which is a brutish-sounding name but he‚Äôs a sweet boy. He loves her dad and her father lets him wear his officer‚Äôs cap. May‚Äôs pushing thirty now and her father‚Äôs on the winter side of fifty, and her worries of marrying right out of school are far behind her now ‚Äî she has enough children to fill a village.\nThe story might be saccharine, but that‚Äôs what no crime and community policing does to constable. It takes these masculine warriors of a community and makes them mums. Vekllei people‚Äôd have it no other way. At once therapists, negotiators, friends and guardians, the community police of Vekllei are symptomatic of the wider feminisation of Vekllei society, and their ambition to crest the final age of industry and enter a peaceful, post-industrial epoch of rest.\n--\nIf you have any questions, I like questions.

Tzipora was a good fighter ‚Äî on her side is viciousness and a conviction to fight. That‚Äôs usually enough for most teen-agers, who like the idea of fighting but are unprepared for the unglamorous reality of it. But those things do not make up for being short and underweight, and the two older girls had her bleeding on the ground by the time two passing community police-officers pulled them apart.\nAs an officer examined Tzipora‚Äôs head with a torch to find the bleeding in her scalp, one of the girls was desperately explaining that Tzipora had swung first and out of nowhere. Tzipora had nothing for her defence, since it was true and since she did not speak to cops, but the policewomen figured it out for themselves easily enough. Tzipora had been beaten savagely in her foolhardy attempt to get back at her bullies, and her pitiful state made the girl‚Äôs desperate blame-passing petty and childish. Although she might have lost the fight, she was not bothered again by the two older girls.\n Part of the difficulty in understanding Vekllei as a foreigner is in the basic assumptions we make through the lens of modernity. Vekllei has not discovered ‚Äòlandscape‚Äô, and it has not discovered ‚Äòthe Child‚Äô.\nNow, children have existed since ever, but we live in an age of modernity and commodity ‚Äî of nuclear power and department stores. The concept of the ‚Äòchild‚Äô as we currently identify and understand it did not exist prior to a certain time, in which the rapid accessibility of both industrial goods and luxury in society stripped children of their productive relationships with family and labour, and introduced them to the beast that would become modern schooling. As Kojin Karatani writes about the Meiji Restoration:\n ‚Ä¶ It becomes clear that the grouping of children by age in the compulsory educational system of modern Japan signified the uprooting of children, as abstract and homogenous entities, from productive relations, social classes, and communities that had previously been their concrete contexts.\n Now, Vekllei is not Japan. Vekllei is caught, instead, between a spectre of modernity and the myth of its past. At once socialistic and deeply conservative, the intuition of the common Vekllei person is going to be fundamentally different to a person acclimatised to foreign society.\nVekllei has a modern compulsory education system like much else of the world, but the way in which Petticoat society is coloured by Upen forces a strange compromise between modernity and Vekllei‚Äôs agrarian past. Tzipora, for example, shares a classroom with students both older and younger than herself. Boys and girls wear a single uniform, shared with teachers, all the way from kindergarten to university. Compulsory school operates only three or four days a week and lasts only for a few hours. Work and play, in addition to education, have always been essential parts of childhood in the country and modern schooling has accommodated that. By the time a child is a teen-ager, the person has essentially transitioned into young-adulthood.\n By sexual maturation, a Vekllei person has essentially transitioned to young-adulthood and submerged themselves in the productive relations of the adult age; they often leave school for work, they quickly drift to mature, independent relationships with parents, and generally marry young.\n The consequence of this idea is that Vekllei people often attend some sort of school for most of their lives. Whether trade schools for work or adult learning institutions for personal curiosity, it is very common to fill the many free hours of a Vekllei person\u0026rsquo;s week with education of some kind.\nThis is not to mislead the reader into imagining adults and children mixing freely, either in compulsory schooling or wider society. Adults do not attend compulsory schools and the median age of a classroom rarely deviates more than a few years either side. But from the perspective of the child, growing up in Vekllei desegregates children from one-another and introduces them to mature economic and social relationships early on, allowing in theory real liberty to choose and work for your lifestyle in the country.\n-\u0026ndash;\nThis scene takes place in a Kadesoinan park, as indicated by the offerings bench and concrete paths snaking through water. In the distance is the Lola Neighbourhood School, with its central classroom tower standing six stories high. In the city beyond is Atomic Park and its distinctive, massive sculpture.\nI‚Äôm still feeling out my ideas on this piece, and I‚Äôll update this post as I figure it out.

It was more than a reflection of character; it was how she talked, how she carried herself. Her clothes were plain, her nervous tics were not that funny, and she was afflicted with all sorts of fears and anxieties. She opens her mouth in public and what comes out is usually of serious opinion ‚Äî a judgement of something or a political remark. But that is not how Gregori syndrome works. It does not take young girls and make them old. As the months wore on and the length of the days reflected the passing of warm season, he learned well enough that she was a teen-ager, despite her seriousness. She was slowly domesticated into regular society, her conversation became casual, and she started to worry more about things that might have been inconceivably petty in the months before.\nIn late November they put up the tree, at her insistence.

She was better when she was happier ‚Äî she smiled more, and the compulsion to pull her shirt or rub her nose abated. It was very strange to see a girl he‚Äôd known as old before her time suddenly revert five years and adopt a flurry of youth; it was a childish rekindling of the good things in her that might be more accessible if she‚Äôd grown up in her home country. He was suckered into the season‚Äôs festivities too, a holiday empty in the country of plenty without faith and family. He even attended a mass at Tzipora‚Äôs request ‚Äî she was still deicidal, but she remained a Catholic and wanted to be a part of the fun.\nOn Christmas Eve Tzipora had put herself to sleep with sickly Winter wine and had curled up on the couch.
