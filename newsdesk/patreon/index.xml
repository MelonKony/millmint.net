      <description>Polyester 👚  SNAPSHOT  Letters  People across the world are very excited by the possibilities and emerging styles in new synthetic materials, including polyester, plastic, and new-nylon. In keeping with her meticulous and mildly neurotic character, Tzipora cannot stand synthetic fibres and refuses wear anything that isn&amp;rsquo;t soft, loose-fitting and hand-washable.
Like most metrics kept in her head, it&amp;rsquo;s largely arbitrary and fluctuates depending on the visibility of materials and her awareness of it, but does invariably inform her sense of fashion, leaving her conservative and old-fashioned in appearance as her peers take on increasingly colourful (and avant garde) styles made possible by a materials revolution.</description>
