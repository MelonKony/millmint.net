	  <description>Back to Issues   a.book-btn:hover { filter: brightness(85%); }  From the Editor Welcome to the second issue of The Atlantic, closing a quiet month for the Petticoat Project that has ushered in several new beginnings. A comic; a new website; new friends — June was a good month. The posts this month departed from the slice-of-life conventions of May, reintroducing maps and infographics to the project. This is a good change!</description>

	  <description>Back to Issues   a.book-btn:hover { filter: brightness(85%); }  From the Editor Welcome to the third issue of The Atlantic. This is the month of postcards, and feeling tired. There are fewer posts this month — and aside from Vekllei’s Race for Inefficiency, they’ve all been pretty tepid stuff. There’s good reason for that, and hopefully we’ll be back to regular production next month. And the postcards are currently making their way around the world — how exciting!</description>

	  <description>Back to Issues   a.book-btn:hover { filter: brightness(85%); }  From the Editor Welcome to the fourth issue of The Atlantic. Good posts this month. Bit of a smorgasbord, with stories covering all sorts of things. Most importantly, as was mentioned last month: I want to start a comic.
How do you go about starting a comic? I don’t think there’s much of a trick to it, as a first-timer — you just have to ’start’.</description>

	  <description>Back to Issues   a.book-btn:hover { filter: brightness(85%); }  From the Editor Welcome to the fifth issue of The Atlantic. I hope you like stories — because this month was all about little snippets of life in Vekllei.
There is a correlation between how nice a picture looks and how short the accompanying story is. Recently, as I’ve finished paintings later and later into the early morning, the posts that follow show signs of my fatigue.</description>

	  <description>Back to Issues   a.book-btn:hover { filter: brightness(85%); }  From the Editor Welcome to the sixth issue of The Atlantic. Big announcements, short bulletin.
I’ve started work on Atomic Modern, better known as ’the Vekllei comic.’ I’m about five pages in so far. I have a distinct style of illustration, but that doesn’t always translate well to a panel format, and navigating that fact has been a real challenge.</description>

	  <description>Back to Issues   a.book-btn:hover { filter: brightness(85%); }  From the Editor Welcome to the sixth issue of The Atlantic. November’s a bitch.
This was a hard month, evidenced in part by the smaller number of posts. Personal problems and some bad news are enough to derail plans, I’m afraid, and so other things had to take their place. November saw an increase in articles on MillMint.net and polish to the site, a whole lot of little sketches, as well as plans for a Patreon milestone reward and some private work on the comic.</description>
