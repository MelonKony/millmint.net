&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the inaugural issue of The Atlantic, a monthly bulletin for enthusiasts and fans of the Petticoat Project, Vekllei, Tzipora and its constellation of interests and affairs. For the benefit of compatibility, The Atlantic is published in websafe typography to keep this bulletin looking great on any screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to contribute to The Atlantic with writing, art or reviews relevant to the spirit of petticoat ideology, please contact Hobart at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:melonkony@icloud.com&#34;&gt;melonkony@icloud.com&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;strong&gt;31st of June&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for supporting Vekllei, and I hope you find value in this bulletin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enjoy — 楽しんで&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To celebrate reaching $50 a month on Patreon, Hobart plans to illustrate, print and ship six full-colour postcards and ship them to Patrons whose total lifetime pledge comes to $20 or more. Contact &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:melonkony@icloud.com&#34;&gt;melonkony@icloud.com&lt;/a&gt; for inquiries and eligibility (or through any other available contact). Currently 2 out of 4 are completed, with several others in various states of completion. &lt;strong&gt;They will be done by the end of June and printed in July.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Studio MillMint site is undergoing major renovations thanks to the contributions of Ben_R_R#2574, a longtime patron and friend of the project. Changes to the site will be announced as they come in this bulletin, the #lounge and Patreon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Atlantic bulletin is launched. There will be twelve issues a year. They will feature content of interest to fans of the Petticoat Project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hobart has his final assessment task due on the 12th of June. Post schedule may suffer leading up to this period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Patreon has hit $80 a month. That’s an incredibly amount of interest and I’d like to thank all patrons for their financial support — it helps keep the lights on and gives me hope that I can work full-time on the project some day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be aware of venrouive and senrouive property, which mark ‘essential’ and ‘personal’ business respectively, but there is also a rarely-used third classification called uousinasenrouive. This means, roughly, “property-obligation”. These places require a physical obligation from their owners, usually a debt owed to the history of the place. For example, an apartment above a bakery would usually fall under such a category, since living there would require operation and maintenance of the business also. Uousinasenrouive are very common in Vekllei, and many older residences involve these work obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fission-cloud-at-veklleis-50th-anniversary&#34;&gt;Fission Cloud at Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s 50th Anniversary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📖 Published 31st May 2020 |&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/gu0nwj/fission_cloud_at_veklleis_50th_anniversary/&#34;&gt;Read here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/images/fission.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In an unprecedented event&lt;/strong&gt;, during Vekllei’s 50th Sea Festival since Independence in 2065, an 8 kiloton fission bomb was sunk to a depth of 150 meters and detonated at midday. It was an incredible sight on a day so clear you could see the gentle curve of the earth where it met the horizon. A flash of light and a spray dome surged outwards into the quiet Atlantic, which was broken apart by plumes that formed a column of water that climbed high into the sky. The lateral plumes, the “mushroom”, reached far across the horizon, forming thick clouds that would begin to rain into the sea. From the coast, fifteen kilometres away, a warm light bathed observers and was followed a moment later by a bang that deeply shook you and those around you. In this instance it seemed that the whole universe was their domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plume would rise nearly 1,500 metres into the sky before falling away. It stayed that way for a while. Almost nobody moved for a long time after — people stood on cars and tables. You could only recognise the scale and the feeling of the fission bomb by seeing it in person.
It seemed incomprehensible, in the face of such a device, that wars could still be fought at all. What use is a battleship in the face of a cloud like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora and Elise, covering the detonation for Lola 7th School’s student newspaper, found themselves not quite sure what to say. Elise wrote, captioning Tziproa’s photograph, “The Independence bomb filled our sky with our sea for a half-hour on Sunday, and with it rose the thoughts of every person in attendance, who considered the awesome power now shouldered by each of us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was indeed some sense that they had contributed to the bomb, and that they had more at their disposal. Few would fly the planes to deliver them, and fewer still had the brains to develop them, but participating in a nuclear century contributed to, in some effect, a nuclear horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;hot-rain-in-the-arctic-circle&#34;&gt;Hot Rain in the Arctic Circle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📖 Published 27th May 2020 |&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tzipora had been ejected&lt;/strong&gt; from the operations room once the guys arrived. She knew what was going down, anyway. No specifics. But you didn’t bring in uniformed soldiers for regular business. National Intelligence liked to work with their own people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five days prior, Baron hailed an EB/NI company car and it pulled up beside him. The electric passenger window slid down. Baron nodded at the passenger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everything’s in here. There’s more if you need it. I’d appreciate a call, I’m in my office all next week, okay?” He passed over a white postage envelope. “Take care.”
The British man opened the letter and read it twice as the car approached the Vekllei World Jetport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JULES WYNN IS YOUR 3RD MAN. “JEREMY” APPEARS IN ARCHIVES 2046 — ALMOST CERTAINLY WYNN. NEARLY 20 YEARS. NOTES TO USSR THRU CYPHER CLERK (UNKNOWN). RECALLED TO MOSCOW — GREAT SUSPICION OF HIM FROM CONTROLLER DOWSETT-CLARK (OXFORD). THIS IS GOOD INFO FROM PARIS ASSET. WYNN WILL DIE IN RUSSIA. GET HIM AND ANOTHER RING SURFACES. CIA KNOWS WHERE BUT NOT WHO. DO US BOTH A FAVOUR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora went for a walk to clear her head. She had a lot going on in her life — though she was sure it seemed small compared to whatever was going on in the operations room.
It began to rain an hour into the walk. She’d left her umbrella with the rest of her things in Baron&amp;rsquo;s office. That was okay. She didn’t mind the shower, anyway — it was mid-summer, and the rain was warm. What a novelty that was, at 60 degrees north. This was weather from the sunny Azores, pulled north by the wind currents over the Atlantic. Within minutes her skirt was heavy and her camisole was showing at the shoulders. She blinked heavy streams of water out of her eyes.
She passed the soldiers on their way out as she returned to AB/NI reception. A friendly receptionist had cloaked her in a towel by the time Baron had found her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Did you have a good meeting?” She asked.
“Sure,” and characteristically, he considered that a satisfactory answer. He pulled the towel off her head. “You’re completely soaked.”
“It doesn’t matter. Are you with those guys? About that other guy?”
“Watch it,” he said. “Keep that talk past security. But I’m going to fly out tomorrow. I’ll be back in the evening.”
“No cooking for me, then. Where are you going? Or can’t you say?”
“England.”
“Oh,” Tzipora said, forming a gun with her fingers. “Like James Bond.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her life was a nexus of various global ambitions, it seemed — imagined only through the dreamy lens of a teen-ager too small for the world’s problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-last-train-out-of-ada&#34;&gt;The Last Train Out of Ada&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📖 Published 20th May 2020 |&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/gndpwo/the_last_train_out_of_ada/&#34;&gt;Read here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/images/missedtrain.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They both watched as train 416 pulled away from the platform.&lt;/strong&gt; And that was that — there would be no school in the morning. That was how it worked in rural Vekllei, a million miles from the automatic trains on endless timetables. Out here, you paced life around the station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was not much to say about this, between the two of them. Tzipora looked at Cobian and pulled a froggy smile that tried to express that it was nobody’s fault. Sure — it was Tzipora who had misplaced her purse, and it was also true that it was Tzipora who’d stopped by the orchard to steal a peach, but as to how they’d missed the train? It was simply impossible to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re a complete idiot,” Cobian said matter-of-factly, and Tzipora wilted. They watched 416 trundle into the sunset. A picturesque vision of rural utopia — if only they were a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;winter-uniforms-in-vekllei&#34;&gt;Winter Uniforms in Vekllei&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📖 Published 16th May 2020 |&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/gkuij7/winter_uniforms_in_vekllei/&#34;&gt;Read here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/images/winteruniforms.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;smallimg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When I paint Vekllei, I usually depict the warmer months.&lt;/strong&gt; Hems are shorter, days are longer, and the destabilisation of the world’s climate has only benefited these arctic people. At the gift end of the Vekllei low pressure system, Scandinavian misery has become Mediterranean pleasure, with warm summers and a mild Autumn and Spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, by late October, the the earth is hard with cold and the days are short. The world may be warmer, but Vekllei’s polar latitude is unchanged, and in the depths of winter the sun only rises for an hour a day. These are Vekllei’s “moon months”, and they announce some of the most important spiritual festivals in Upen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although school hours are reduced in winter, life carries on and Vekllei fashion becomes traditionally utilitarian. Tzipora has poor circulation and cold hands even in the warm months, and by November she’s traded the skirt and gi for traditional rouisha trousers and a cloak. Rouisha, like a lot of traditional clothing, have origins in agriculture and are characterised by a loose, baggy fit and insulated lining. Cobian is wearing a heavy wool sack-type dress, which is worn like an apron over other clothing. Winter brings forth “petticoat society” literally. Note the leather plate on her shoulder, to which her christmas aiguillette is attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, Winter’s revival of traditional clothing and customs further evidences its practice as the most traditional season of the year. Although the warm calendar flourishes with the futurist sympathies of a modernist Vekllei, not even the atomic age has been able to dispense with its hard-worked pragmatism developed in a millennia of bitter cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2031-apartment-diagram&#34;&gt;2031 Apartment Diagram&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📖 Published 15th May 2020 |&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/gjpcha/2031_apartment_diagram/&#34;&gt;Read here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/images/apartment.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baron had inherited the apartment from his uncle&lt;/strong&gt;, who passed in the year following his parents. It was in a mixed residential-industrial neighbourhood, adjacent to a canvas factory. Out back was a rivulet, which roared in the long rainstorms of early April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each January, the Colour Bureau of the Architecture Assembly announces the year’s colours, and tradition in mainstream architecture and interior design is to incorporate the announced palettes, which usually contain a hundred or so colours. His uncle’s apartment had been built and furnished in 2031, and so it had a #2031 Colour Profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, it was a very conventional apartment in the Vekllei tradition. It had a sauna and bath in the wetroom, a bidet, a sunken living room and a bread oven. In others, it was more peculiar. The apartment was bizarrely allocated across three levels. You alighted the entrance light well into a sunken living space, then climbed back up into the kitchen. The main living room and master bedroom were another step above the kitchen. Adjacent to the main living area was a closet and study, which overlooked the entrance from a half-meter mezzanine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was in this study that Tzipora set up shop when she arrived in March 2063. Baron had been reluctant to take her even provisionally, not least because it would mean searching for a new apartment in his busy return period after being abroad for ten years. Tzipora, however, had lived in a dormitory for much of her life and had settled in the alcove once she acquired a dresser screen. She refused outright the master bedroom, which sparked a sleepy agoraphobia. By the time Baron had made other accomodations, Tzipora had entrenched herself in the neighbourhood and had developed a severe sentimentality about the apartment and its rivulet, and so that was where he lived for the rest of his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, Tzipora had a strange kinship with the apartment. Baron sealed himself off in the master bedroom each night, but she never left the main living space. It was warm in there, especially in the flickering light of the enormous oven and fireplace, and when she moved the screen aside in the morning her little corner became part of the living area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had a lot of good memories of that apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fiery-peaks&#34;&gt;Fiery Peaks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📖 Published 7th May 2020 |&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/gel3e9/fiery_peaks/&#34;&gt;Read here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/images/peaks.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;smallimg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After three days in Ada&lt;/strong&gt;, Tzipora set off towards Mt Miya. She made good time, and after three hours had happened upon the shoulders of the bright Volouisnesnkull Glacier. It was about here that she heard a morbid industrial siren, echoing up the valleys from far away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first she thought it might have come from Ada, since Boya Chemical had a large plant there, but as she lay out her things for lunch she heard the distinct whine of a turbojet. It grew louder, and deeper, until a National Fire VTOL tanker roared across the sky, swirling powdered snow on nearby peaks as it arced across the glacier. It was close enough to catch the sun ablaze in the reflection of its glass nosecone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She later learned that lava streams had opened up not far from where she’d hiked, and had been making their way towards a geothermal power plant nestled in the highlands. In the evening, on her way back, she saw a long line of fire supertankers and pumpers spraying water in beautiful arcs, where it caught hisses from bright streams of melted rock. It was a common enough sight in Vekllei — hoses were the only defence you could reasonably make against the the fracturing earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it was not often you saw jets flying so low. It was funny to her that even the barren glaciers were tamed in this age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-chemical-feast&#34;&gt;The Chemical Feast&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📖 Published 6th May 2020 |&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/ge1gmw/the_chemical_feast/&#34;&gt;Read here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/images/feast.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;East of Montre, West of Tjornes, waits a rare sight among Vekllei’s hard igneous slopes&lt;/strong&gt; — a crown of gentle sedimentary cliffs packed with ruddy sandstone, which melt glacially into the sea chasing blue-sky bergs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora was, at the time, making her way on foot from Montre-Lola to Ada, which was a coastal town in the North-East known for its luxurious health spas. Tzipora was not much interested in health, but she was interested in walking, and she made a pilgrimage along the coast every few years to make sense of the world. She was going whichaway and destined for nowhere in particular. Tzipora was very much Baron’s daughter, in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had stopped to see the Red Cliffs forty kilometres out from Tjornes when she saw a cruiser of the constabulary parked unusually by the shore. The constabulary were not local police — they were a national outfit tasked with policing government and “bureau business”. You found them at power plants, outside universities, guarding the prime minister and providing bodies for HO/NI (Home Office at National Intelligence) when they needed doors kicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora was not the sort of girl to be intimidated by a badge, and she wandered innocently to the shore where she found the cruiser empty. She looked across a beach of black sand and saw some sort of operation playing out — there was a gun boat not too far from the shore, and a police hydrofoil beached on the sand. She counted maybe a dozen officers. She wondered if they’d arrest her if she walked down to see what was happening. She climbed onto the hood of the cruiser to get a better look. Perhaps it was immigrants — or smugglers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It only took another moment to spot the smashed crates broken across the rocks before she knew what was going on. She was witnessing the dying days of the countercultural decade, and its chemical fuel was now smashed open before her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2070s were a wild time for the so-called “pink years” in Vekllei, and for the first time in Tzipora’s memory she started seeing “pleasure drugs” on the streets. There had always been plenty of sin carrying on in Vekllei, even in her early days — hallucinogenics, alcohol, and synthesised highs were legal and easy. But you didn’t see much of the exotic stuff, which grew in a better climate. Hash, coke, H — it was all underground stuff for personal use. These drugs were listed among many others in the class-A import prohibition orders, which made them hard to find and illegal to import. These were “pleasure drugs” — the Vekllei phrase for overseas narcotics that didn’t have a place in Upen or a preexisting cultural history. Comparatively, they were just ‘for pleasure’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H for heroin was a big news item for a long time, and with it you had one the largest moral panics in modern Vekllei cultural memory. Crackdowns came soon after. Tzipora found it difficult to describe the feeling of the time. It was a new generation — one she didn’t belong to, despite her appearance — and she didn’t have much sympathy for hedonists. They might tell her different, but she never thought the pink years were about much more than feeling good all of the time. She wondered if she was growing old and grumpy inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wondered how the crates had got there. Had the coast guard sunk another smugger? You heard about the navy firing shots in the news sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruined with seawater and picked over by constables, the chemical feast of Vekllei’s pink years died with the times. Tzipora wouldn’t miss it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stepped off the hood and set off back towards the road, where a warm inn and hot food awaited her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-trials-of-cobian&#34;&gt;The Trials of Cobian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📖 Published 2nd May 2020 |&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/gbknfu/the_trials_of_cobian/&#34;&gt;Read here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/images/trials.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;smallimg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to her friends, Tzipora’s contemporary afflictions were tragic. Her medical problems; her violent childhood; her sensitivity and melancholy — you could feel sorry for her, because a lot of her problems were not her fault. She invoked sympathy.
Tzipora never considered herself particularly tragic. It seemed straightforward, if difficult; she continued to live — and so she lived. Tzipora&amp;rsquo;s sympathy was instead reserved for her first and closest friend: Cobian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cobian was not well-liked at school, and it did not take long for Tzipora to find out why. She had a childish edge for a sixteen-year-old, and bitterly hated losing. She was not good at school or sports, was not particularly charming, and came across as desperately lonely. She was a quiet misandrist, which would have been fine if she could play the part of a self-assured social matriarch, but her mother’s despotic conservatism struck out that possibility early on. Such is life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because her world was predicated on being liked and living a normal life, her psyche prohibited self-reflection. That was the great difference between Cobian and Tzipora. They may both have been young and neurotic, but Tzipora’s relentless self-interrogation left great space for personal growth. Cobian was instead trapped in a domestic play-fantasy, in which she could live out a mythical high-school life, and shattering that illusion would collapse her whole reason for being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora recalled visiting Cobian’s home for the first time. Cobian’s mother asked Tzipora to remove her shoes and socks and wash her feet before going to play inside. By the time Tzipora found Cobian in her room, the girl had already changed and handed over her uniform to be laundered. Tzipora, in her tomboyish indigence, had never encountered such a brutally hygienic regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cobian was a different girl at home. Her anxiety and neurosis washed out a little, and her confidence was propped up by the routines her mother had set out for her since she was a child. There was a friendly, curious girl buried under a decade of loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora wondered what Cobian thought about lying in bed at night, and why the girl worried so much about things that didn’t matter. And it was precisely in the smallness of those things and the tremendous anxiety Cobian owed toward them that made Tzipora want to hug her. To be so worked up over something so pathetic was startlingly moving. The idea that the girl had deluded herself into a corner of hopelessness seemed sad — and the fact that no one would reasonably care about such a feeble, meaningless, self-inflicted state of affairs made it tragic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Tzipora’s friendship and the world it opened up for her, some of Cobian’s edges were sanded down. Some of it was a late maturity — some of it was Tzipora’s dismantling of the scaffolding the girl’s mother had shoved in there. With that effort, and obvious love, Cobian’s reason for being changed too. One day, in Tzipora’s presence, it didn’t seem so important to be liked by everybody anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;strong&gt;❖ Note from the Editor&lt;/strong&gt;
This essay was published on the original Vekllei site in February 2019. Since it will not be coming back, it is being reprinted here in a desperate attempt to fill out this issue. Yes, it’s painfully self-concerned and a little painful to read back, but for newcomers to the project you might find some “obvious truths” about Vekllei you have not yet encountered.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not come to Tokyo to find a reference for the Petticoat Project, because utopia does not exist there for me. In fact, by nearly every Vekllei metric, Tokyo is positively dystopian — a consumer paradise of the crushing, isolating modernity Vekllei is supposed to escape. And yet, marks of this city (and this country) are prevalent through Vekllei as a constructed country and my aesthetic as a writer and an artist. I can’t bring myself to love all of Japanese society, but I do love the country and its people. This intersection between traditional utopian world-building (along the lines of News from Nowhere or even the original Utopia) and the emotional, linear fragments of utopian storytelling which realise the cold encyclopaedia of a utopian world were the focus of my expedition to Japan. The premise of Vekllei society is at odds with so much of Japanese society — yet the emotional, aesthetic culture of the country (what I call the ‘character’ of utopianism) has influenced my media creation tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a supplementary preface, I would like to note that it would be terrible of me to dismiss Japan as an oriental wonder of salarymen and neo-Zaibatsu. That approach has more in common with Frank Capra’s wartime propaganda piece Know Your Enemy: Japan than it does with real structural criticism. It is all too easy to dismiss the social and economic conditions of the country today as the natural inclination of a Japanese caricature — a homogenous hive-mind of enormously productive and obedient people. This is of course a terrible attack on the proud and long-standing tradition of dissent and progressiveness in the country — which is also home to one of the world’s largest opposition communist parties. It is a country of student mobilisation, protests and intense factionalism between the left and right-wing radicals (Andrews, W., 2016). It is important not to conflate the impersonal structures of a society with the orientalist idea of cultural predisposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A love of Studio Ghibli films and a desire for material and emotional escapism is what drives my utopian world-building. Where co-founder Isao Takahata had a penchant for artful emotional realism and domestic drama, Hayao Miyazaki has found tremendous success in Japan and abroad with his fantastical stories rich with nostalgia and warmth. They have obvious recurring themes — childhood, environmentalism, aircraft, etc., but it is no real secret (at least to media critics and Ghibli superfans) that these overt recurrences are symptomatic of more serious and grounded beliefs. In a fantastic analysis of My Neighbour Totoro, Phillip E. Wegner makes use of Kojin Karatani’s works (another great influence of mine) to illustrate Miyazaki’s uniquely Japanese pre-Meiji cross-generational nostalgia evident in the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Miyazaki presents us with in My Neighbor Totoro is a vision in which the classic &amp;ldquo;what if&amp;rdquo; question of the genre has been proposed: that is, what if the Meiji revolution did not happen? Moreover, since it is the dramatic and rapid modernization of the Meiji period that gives rise to the virulent imperialist nationalism and militarism that ultimately results in the Second World War, Miyazaki also offers in his film us a glimpse of a Japan in which the catastrophe of World War II did not occur (Wegner, P.E., 2010).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan’s spectre of modernity is a recurring character in many of Miyazaki’s films, just as the villain of war revives itself time and time again — from the steel production of Iron Town in Princess Mononoke to the death of the golden age of aviation in The Wind Rises. Karatani’s landmark work, Origins of Japanese Literature, makes clear that basic premises of modern society — from children to history to nature — are not immutable items atomised by scientific fact, but instead products of modern society that have not always existed (Karatani, K., 1993. pp. 12-44, 113-135). Vekllei reflects this concept, at least superficially — children are represented as independent agents desegregated from modern age-based schooling, nature is regarded as a fellow social organ, and work is largely self-satisfying and decommodified. These are things that are important to me and it makes sense enough that Vekllei reflects that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, even supposedly less political Ghibli films like Kiki’s Delivery Service carry powerful images of the ‘spectre of modernity’. Regarding the climax of the film in which a zeppelin soars hopelessly out of control over a city, A.J. Rocca hauntingly writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[We] find that this is not truly a witch’s story, but a ghost story. The ghost died in a fire on 6 May 1937, foreshadowing the fires of a war that would change the world forever. The ghost is called the Spirit of Freedom in the film, but its true name is LZ 129 Hindenburg, and it’s not the spirit of freedom but the ghost of modernity (Rocca, 2017).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the material manifestation of Japanese society for me— despite all the glory of her bright packaging and dense infrastructure — is an aesthetic and satirical media culture that saturates the Petticoat Project. Vekllei is a &amp;lsquo;poor man’s Utopia&amp;rsquo;, inspired in part by my superficial understanding of a ‘poor man’s Japan&#39;. Vekllei, like media representations of postwar Shōwa Japan, has a shadow of pacifism and shame about it (that idea that &amp;lsquo;all politics is sexual pathology’ occurs to me). These are deliberate aesthetic choices that reflect not landscape utopianism but character utopianism — the real colour of a constructed world that acts out the structure of mean ideology and culture-constructs. These ill-defined images of utopian society, and a rejection of landscape world-building, are excellent vehicles for utopian writing. After all, it is sustained engagement with utopia that betrays the totality of it (Wegner, P.E., 1998). What fascinates me particularly about Miyazaki’s unique utopian instincts is his recurring premise is essentially nostalgic and escapist — the aesthetic of a Miyazaki film is almost always midcentury or earlier, illustrating a time before Japan’s ‘modern century’. This is in stark contrast to the saccharine optimism of utopian socialists like Morris, Chernyshevsky, and Bellemy, telling stories of a future yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is to say nothing of the aesthetic qualities of a Japanese city!  Tokyo is a wonderful glimpse of a retro-future as imagined by the 1980s — as though the economic crisis of the 1990s has since suspended time. Japan is clean and modern, but also retrofuturistic. The lifeblood of the city is in rebar and concrete as infrastructure. The people on the street are dressed in conservative items that go without the prudish connotations of similar Western fashion. Working men and women are suited traditionally, many with waistcoats. Such is the visual language of modern Japan. Young men sport tech-wear or innovative types of street-wear dominated by colour and comfort. General women’s fashion leans heavily on items popularly discarded in Western markets, at least until recently. Pleat or patterned skirts, blouses, cardigans, hosiery and socks, loafers and brogues, etc. are very common and provide a wonderful anecdotal rebuff to the outrageous images of ‘Harajuku girls’ and Lolita style that epitomise some ideas of Japanese fashion. The famous ‘sailor uniform’ has been largely phased out of junior and senior high schooling, replaced with Western-style blazers and ties. Tokyo is not ‘behind’ the rest of the world; that is not what it means to be retrofuturistic. In my eyes, it has disembarked from Western technological and fashion attitudes some time ago and has since progressed on its own collective cultural intuition, and has subsequently spent the last few decades exporting media, fashion and culture into the West. It’s a great thing to see in person, at the heart of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my qualms with modern Japanese consumer society, Vekllei is perched on a romanticised and fictitious Japanese aesthetic, and the country is enormously influential on the way I go about world-construction. With one sentence I will denounce the complexity of Japanese honorific language systems and in the other fawn over the mixed agricultural-residential suburbs that make up so much of the land outside of Tokyo’s city limits. Koka parks were inspired by these displays of community food production. The Vekllei Constabulary were created after research and experience with the Japanese Police Box system. Vekllei’s knotted network of trains and streetcars are reminiscent of Tokyo and Hiroshima. For all my public rejection of modern consumer society, and my begrudging participation in it, the Japanese qualities of Vekllei are valuable and are utopian in their own right — and so Tokyo remains one of the most important inspirations of Petticoat Society in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what of that dichotomy? Of deep ideological incongruities with Japanese consumer society, but an embarrassing affection for the mythological post-war aesthetic and Japanese culture? The truth of it is that Vekllei is first and foremost a collection of stories, and stories are the domain of the emotional. Wonderful, vague images of utopia — like washing corn in My Neighbour Totoro or an all-night writing session in Whisper of the Heart. My time in Tokyo introduced me to a wealth of these nostalgic feelings — of curiosity in a cauldron of social atomisation. Life in Tokyo is not without problems, and it is certainly not my perfect idea of utopia, but the intersection of the culture and promise of Japanese society, either in the past as alt-history or in the future as science fiction, has me coming back time and time again to better realise my own projects of utopia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the second issue of The Atlantic, closing a quiet month for the Petticoat Project that has ushered in several new beginnings. A comic; a new website; new friends — June was a good month. The posts this month departed from the slice-of-life conventions of May, reintroducing maps and infographics to the project. This is a good change! Look forward to more diagrams from Vekllei in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d also like to thank the contributors to this edition, Hangdog and Chev, for their essays. If you would like to contribute to The Atlantic with writing, art or reviews relevant to the spirit of petticoat ideology, please contact Hobart at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:melonkony@icloud.com&#34;&gt;melonkony@icloud.com&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;strong&gt;31st of July.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for supporting Vekllei, and I hope you find value in this bulletin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hobart Phillips
&lt;strong&gt;Enjoy — 楽しんで&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The postcard set for patrons is (just about) complete and awaiting the printers. I’ll contact patrons with a lifetime pledge of $20 or above for shipping addresses, and any patron who wants to make up the rest of their $20 for a set is welcome to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Studio MillMint site is still under renovation. A lot of progress has been made in June, including a timeline page and the infrastructure required for a wiki and blog, but I’ve got so much going on at the moment that the site’s been relegated to “whenever there is time”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The comic has started in one form or another. It’s uni-related for now. Very soon I hope to be publishing storyboards of the “real deal” for patrons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hobart&amp;rsquo;s uni break has started. Nice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thank you always, patrons, for your continued support. It makes me feel loved, and lets me afford things like the postcards.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 15th is Cobian’s birthday. It was on this day that Tzipora and Cobian first introduced themselves to each other, after Cobian’s ill-fated sweet sixteenth birthday party. Cobian was so struck with affection towards Tzipora and her friendliness that she was invited to a sleepover the following weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be aware that puffins are Vekllei’s national bird — but did you know that some people keep them as pets? In coastal fishing towns, puffins make good friends. They’re curious, unafraid birds that keep their “pufflings&amp;quot; safe in burrows underground. Vekllei has the largest population of Atlantic Puffins in the world. They’re also rather tasty!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiousmanyiosn&lt;/strong&gt; — “friendly architecture”. This is a &lt;em&gt;Newda&lt;/em&gt; term that describes architecture friendly to its surrounds. “Friendly,” here, means to integrate and socialise with a structure’s surrounds, by employing local materials and styles. It can also be “friendly” in its purpose — to provide a foundational service to a community, something important to cultural fabric. In this sense, &lt;em&gt;Fiousmanyiosn&lt;/em&gt; refers to both a materials principle and cultural architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Vekllei?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hi, I’m Hobart and I write and draw Vekllei&lt;/strong&gt; at Studio MillMint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty complex project. Not just complex insofar as there’s a lot to read about it, but that it uses concepts and terminology you might not be familiar with if this is your first time around utopian fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Vekllei is a utopia — what does this mean? It’s latin for “no place,” and I use that literally. Vekllei, in a literal sense, cannot exist. Not because I think it could never have existed, or that some part of it is completely unreasonable, or it breaks the laws of physics — but because it exists in a certain place and time that is just isn’t replicable. It’s all built from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei is a very good place to live, &lt;strong&gt;but it is not perfect&lt;/strong&gt;. Utopia does not mean “perfect place”. Utopia is a form of social dreaming, much like worldbuilding, linked to the values and priorities of its author. In utopian studies, “utopia” is usually broken down further:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eutopia&lt;/strong&gt; — “good place”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dystopia&lt;/strong&gt; — “bad place”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that both form a part of the “utopia” — this is appropriate, since Vekllei is grounded in a social realism that acknowledges the good and bad parts of life. Indeed, they are inseparable — you cannot have the light without the dark. Obviously, in my eyes, Vekllei is very much a eutopia.
You can read more about Vekllei (the country) by clicking here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three parts to my “social dreaming”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Landscape&lt;/strong&gt; — the world and country of Vekllei. When you think of “utopia,” this is it — shining modernist cities against striking landscapes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Character&lt;/strong&gt; — not all social dreaming takes place in spaces. Some of it is built around experiences, objects and relationships. Tzipora is a “character utopia” in the sense that she represents a utopian life experience, full of stories good and bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&lt;/strong&gt; — Vekllei is a representation of the problems of my life, as a form of escapism. A lot of my posts here reflect dissatisfactions and displacements in my own life — consumer society, commodification of childhood, wage labour, postmodernism, etc. I’m very much a part of this utopian dialectic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s run through some of the common queries and misunderstandings about Vekllei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are you?
&lt;em&gt;A Tasmanian illustrator.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re not Japanese?
&lt;em&gt;お前はもう死んでいる&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is Vekllei a utopia?
&lt;em&gt;It makes me feel better about my life and the world. It’s escapism; it’s a dream.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit cringe to grandstand your political beliefs, doncha think?
&lt;em&gt;Vekllei is a personal utopia. That’s what I’m selling. At least you’re getting good opinions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where’s the tension if it’s perfect?
&lt;em&gt;Vekllei is very cynical and tragic in places. Utopia is just a reflection of the author, good and bad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a novel? A story? A comic?
&lt;em&gt;I’m working on a comic right now. I’m pretty much working on Vekllei full-time so I’m hoping to announce it soon. I’ve got a lot of different Vekllei projects going.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where is Vekllei?
&lt;em&gt;Iceland.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does Vekllei look Japanese?
&lt;em&gt;Vekllei is like a country of Scandinavians speaking French with an Aussie accent in Shōwa era Japan/Maoist China/Taiwan etc. Vekllei looks however I imagine utopia looks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does that make sense?
&lt;em&gt;Why can’t it just be cool?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is your alt-history thought out?
&lt;em&gt;Vekllei’s history is whatever I need it to be. I’m always trying to be realistic, but it’s all worked backwards from the setting. I’m not really “worldbuilding” in a typical sense. Very little of it is published, most of it is retrieved on request. Just ask if you have questions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is Vekllei communist?
&lt;em&gt;No.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Vekllei calls itself “petticoat socialist”.
&lt;em&gt;Vekllei is set in a culture of Marxist revivalism in the 50s and 60s. A lot of Vekllei’s lexicon is set in that context. Vekllei is a decentralised democracy that doesn’t use money. It’s a sort of participatory economy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why the &amp;ldquo;petticoat&amp;rdquo;?
&lt;em&gt;Vekllei is a female country. Womanhood is decommodified. It&amp;rsquo;s maternal, social and friendly where socialist rhetoric is masculine, technocratic and progressive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is Zelda?
&lt;em&gt;Zelda is another name for Tzipora. She has two names specifically to confuse you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the “bulletin”?
&lt;em&gt;I publish the Atlantic Bulletin once a month via email. It’s got the month’s posts in it as well as facts and tidbits from Vekllei. DM me an email if you want to join.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;village-map-of-montre-lola&#34;&gt;Village Map of Montre-Lola&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📖 Published 29th June 2020 |&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/hhjytf/village_map_of_montrelola/&#34;&gt;Read here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/images/montrelola.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;smallimg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The village of Montre-Lola&lt;/strong&gt; is home to about 400 people in its entirety, a stone’s throw from the Aisyo borough. Each morning, however, the population swells as 300 children from tiny villages in both Aisyo and Montre take a fast tram to the Montre-Lola Area School No. 2, a district school raising all ages of local youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many Vekllei villages, Montre-Lola’s history is complex and has origin stories in both viking-inuit settlement as well as less sentimental government programmes that flourished after the atomic war. By historical accounts, Montre-Lola has been inhabited since at least 1500CE. By contemporaneous records, however, it was established as a village in land reform during the 1960s and revitalised by the building of the area school in 2057.
Montre-Lola features many civic objects common to Vekllei villages — a nondenominational place of worship (in this case, a historical Catholic church), a constabulary, a doctor, an auto/tractor pool, a general store, a station platform, and a village hall. A map of the village centre is dominated by the Area School, built in an Edunewda style, which features many new facilities that distinguish it from smaller, 20th-century schools. It’s a good place to grow up; where farmland and earnest modernity collide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Montre-Lola is most relevant as the residence of Tzipora Desmoisnes, the world’s oldest person and one of the first people to be diagnosed with Gregori-Heitzfeld Syndrome. She works as a librarian in both the Montre-Lola Area School and the Montre-Lola Library &amp;amp; Archives, spending most of her 12-hour workday in either of these institutions. She commutes via fast trams, which arrive automatically at the two platforms in Montre-Lola every half-hour and continue out into the surrounding farms. This means that, if she sets her watch right, she can step outside her front door and arrive at the school library in under ten minutes. This journey is marked in red on the map above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominated by farmland, Montre-Lola is communal and more traditionally ‘anarchist’ in flavour than Vekllei’s urban boroughs, which are obscured by convenience. As charming as it is suffocating, the community is very close-knit and made up of all sorts — smart educated young men and women sent from Montre to teach, as well as farming families that have resided here for centuries. Life moves slower and people know each other. When the school hosts its cross-country race each year, nearly every person in the village is out to watch it. After all, it takes a village to raise a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-vekllei-crown-coins-of-a-moneyless-country&#34;&gt;The Vekllei Crown: coins of a moneyless country&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/images/crown.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei, legendarily, does not use circulate currency&lt;/strong&gt;. Goods and services are moved and offered arbitrarily, provided amply in abundance. Anything that is not abundant is manufactured and distributed directly under the control of a bureau, which is a trade organ responsible to the affairs of the country. At no point do coins or paper currency change hands in the day-to-day affairs of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, Vekllei is usually described as “moneyless” — yet it does in fact have a currency. The Vekllei Kroner, or “Crown,” is hundreds of years old, and Vekllei still operates a mint for currency. At any time, a Vekllei person can write to the National Mint and order a set of coins, like the ones pictured above. So what is going on here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Kroner has not been used since 2022, after the last village in Stochi returned coinage to the Mint, it continues to exist to this day as a gold-backed currency in the International Market, through which Vekllei trades with other countries. The physical coins, produced mostly as a novelty in the tradition of &lt;em&gt;mayaesdiou&lt;/em&gt; (medallions, or small metal pieces commonly collected and given in Vekllei), are a physical coinage of the International Market. The coins also operate as a form of bullion, or wealth reserve, since each coin is worth exactly its face value in gold. Since the International Market is completely closed and independent of the domestic economy, its value is controlled directly by the so-called Government Bank. It is one of the few gold-backed currencies in a developed nation today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further complicate things, there are actually two different Kroner in Vekllei. There is the &lt;strong&gt;Vekllei Kroner&lt;/strong&gt;, which represents the International Market, but there is also a seperate &lt;strong&gt;Government/State Kroner&lt;/strong&gt;, which is not minted and used only as an investment mechanism, backed by government &amp;ldquo;white bonds&amp;rdquo; which are usually measures of labour-hours or refined materials. It is, in a sense, a fiat currency alongside a gold-backed currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They exist independently because they are used for two seperate purposes. The Vekllei Kroner is used a wealth reserve and bullion, and also represents the collective wealth of the Vekllei people. Each citizen, in theory, is entitled to an equal share of the Government Bank, although it can only be withdrawn as currency in specific circumstances. Vekllei also holds substantial amounts of foreign currency in the Government Bank and Vekllei Kroner, which is used to invest and stabilise holdings and capital in foreign countries. The Government Kroner, on the other hand, is used as an investment mechanism abroad, usually in support of infrastructure. It is also used to acquire foreign currencies through investment in foreign capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite having two currencies, neither the &amp;ldquo;Vekllei Crown&amp;rdquo; or the &amp;ldquo;Government Crown&amp;rdquo; are used in the domestic economy in Vekllei, which is autonomous and not subject to a central bank. So it is that Vekllei’s currency is both little more than a novelty and essential to the function of the country in a world still ruled by money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the coinage depicted above — 8 coins are minted in Vekllei today&lt;/strong&gt;. They were designed in 2015, in the year of independence. They represent eight core values in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “small crowns,” worth 1VK and 10VK respectively, represent fraternity and liberty, two founding elements of the Vekllei constitution. The 50VK coin is plated in silver and has a small ruby inset. Rubies are used to represent energy, in this case, the vitality of the spirits, which dominate Upen and the Vekllei landscape. The 100, 200, 500 and 1,000VK coins represent different landscapes of the country. As a volcanic island nation, the ocean (100) and landscape (200) coins are fairly straightforward. The humanity coin (500) represents the Vekllei people and ancestry — note how humans are placed alongside other natural forces. The flower coin (1,000VK) represents the flowers of the country, which are important spiritually and have formed part of the Vekllei identity. Vekllei has the most flowers per capita in the world. The final, larger 10,000VK coin represents the previous seven together, as a total sum of Vekllei landscape and identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer Tzipora’s question — a bottle of fizzy drink cost about 2VK in the waning days of coinage in the early 2020s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The largest division of any portion of Vekllei land is the borough&lt;/strong&gt;; a region of varying size and population with common culture, food dependency and economic interest. Anything larger than that is simply Vekllei — they are “one city”, after all, and consider themselves a city-state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been exactly 100 boroughs since 2015. Each is named after the largest city in its region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The smallest borough is &lt;strong&gt;Bakur&lt;/strong&gt;, in Afouismeh, with a population of 7,500 people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The largest is &lt;strong&gt;Vekllei proper&lt;/strong&gt;, in the Capital Region, of 2.4 millions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transit map illustrates all 100 boroughs, Vekllei’s five tallest mountains, its permafrost glaciers and Tzipora’s home in Montre-Lola. Her five largest boroughs — namely &lt;strong&gt;Vekllei&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lonne&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Adouisneh&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Montre&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Copette&lt;/strong&gt;, are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in this simple transit map we can see several truths about the country, like its population bias on the West Coast and the emptiness of the Lava volcanic region. You might recognise a few names there, like Lola in the West (Tzipora’s home with Baron) and Yana in Vekllei’s Ro Highlands (Ayn’s birthplace).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trains are clean, reliable, fast, efficient and safe. They are incorporated under Vekllei Rail, owned by the Transport Group Bureau. Using this map, designed for domestic tourists and foreigners, the adequacy of Vekllei’s rail transport is easy to plan around — you can eat breakfast in a cafe in the seaside town of Mumen, and hike before midday on the glacial slopes of Askayoisn. Since there are no tickets or costs, there are no excuses for not visiting relatives in the country, now that transport is now a trivial inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each borough is represented in Vekllei’s parliament by an elected representative. These representatives wield extraordinarily disproportionate power — the representative for Callaisn, for example, represents hundreds of times more people than the representative for Tanger, but both have the same vote. This is because boroughs are not just representative of their populations, but also their environments, industry and other social organs otherwise unable to vote. It is important to keep in mind that Upen (and consequently, policy) recognises the landscape itself as the sovereign organ of the country, and so in this sense it has its own interests and projections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, representatives act in an advisory, nonpartisan role in government, voting rarely in an auxiliary role to the professionalised, elected legislature. Vekllei has a strictly constitutional parliament, and the economy largely prohibits interference. In this sense, the parliament is both partially undemocratic in its inefficiency and apolitical in its orientation as a sort of civil service bureau, managing state affairs and reacting to pressures and the long-term aims outlined in the 2015 constitution. In the Vekllei mindset, the “government” is more or less another bureau, no different or particularly more interesting than the Transport Group Bureau. The trains, at least, have a tangible impact on their daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How appropriate, then, that this transit map produced in the summer months of 2076 combines both monuments of society. It also offers a glimpse of a larger, documented country not necessarily revealed in piecemeal story posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-most-beautiful-woman&#34;&gt;A Most Beautiful Woman&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📖 Published 12th June 2020 |&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/h1480l/a_most_beautiful_woman/&#34;&gt;Read here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/images/ayn.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;smallimg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Tzipora first laid eyes on Ayn&lt;/strong&gt;, hours after her arrival in the country, she thought, “that’s the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t just her features or figure that captured Tzipora’s attention — it was also her confident, inconspicuous movements and a quiet self-assuredness that seemed obvious in her gentle expression and posture. Tzipora was not quite sure how to describe it. Her beauty was very alive in the way she inhabited a space, as she walked into the hotel lounge to meet them. Maybe it was grace — maybe it was a little girl-crush — she didn’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Baron greeted her and they exchanged cheek kisses, it appeared to Tzipora that Ayn and Baron were old friends, and she was further assured in her respect for him — that Baron could know such beautiful women seemed natural! Baron was capable of anything in Tzipora’s eyes, a figure of ultimate power — it only made sense that he knew this woman!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, both Ayn and Baron were mortal, and Tzipora got to know them well during the helter-skelter weeks following her arrival in Vekllei. Baron might have rescued her, but it was Ayn who introduced her to Vekllei, as AB/NI called Baron into office for the first time in a decade. It was Ayn who took her clothes shopping and wrestled with Zelda’s obsessive-compulsive fabric requirements. It was Ayn who taught Tzipora her first Vekllei sentence. And in the end, it was Ayn who convinced Baron that he had to take responsibility for Tzipora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only years later that Tzipora began to realise that Ayn and Baron were, in a sense, married to each other through their work. They worked closely (he as recent head of operations at AB/NI, she as a research analyst in American economics) and their friendship went back decades. She was his “work wife,” which was the closest Baron could ever get to that particular institution, and so her proximity and love towards Tzipora made her a mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was a vision of everything Tzipora wanted for herself — to be capable and respected; beautiful and unassuming; intelligent and productive. And once more, it was Ayn, in the end, who convinced Tzipora that she could these things for herself, regardless of her genetic disability. “Go out there,” is what she said, “and trust in yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-oa-class-battlecruiser&#34;&gt;The Oa-Class Battlecruiser&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📖 Published 6th June 2020 |&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/images/cruiser.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei’s defensive military posture has&lt;/strong&gt;, in doctrine and arms development, limited its ability to meaningfully project power outside of the Atlantic. As an island nation with a large and multifaceted naval armada, the Oa-Class Battlecruiser is the heart of her armed forces, as the flagship of her fleets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where U.S. doctrine places carriers offensively in the structure of its ship-groups, the Vekllei Navy is considerably more Soviet in its employ of carriers as primarily defensive air-bases to exercise sovereignty over her far-flung territories and island possessions. Oa-class Battlecruisers are notable as hybrid carrier-battleships, and feature a diagonal jetway with capacity for carrier-type naval jets (almost indistinguishable in the illustration above) and a variety of VTOL aircraft, which are common by the 2050s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First built in the 2050s by the sprawling National Naval Arsenal (located on Vekllei’s Far East coast, close to the foundries that pour her iron), 12 Oa-Class Battlecruisers are in service in the 2070s. They carry heavy fission reactors built by bureau monopoly General Reactor, supplemented by a gas-turbine generator, as is standard on all Vekllei-built nuclear vessels. Her unusual serpentine funnel is characteristic of Vekllei’s navy, and is a distinguishing feature of their naval design language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her hulking superstructure and massive 15-inch fore guns recall the capital battleships of yesteryear, but she is a thoroughly modern battlecruiser with contemporary armament and electrics for combat and fleet administration. Named after Vekllei’s National flower, these Battlecruisers are the third-largest vessels in the navy and are multifunctional by design, often operated as strategic and operational platforms to support Vekllei’s large defensive armadas that patrol the North Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is armed with two triple-barrelled 15-inch shore guns that can be loaded with a variety of shells including nuclear payloads, silos for guided missiles, and specialised guns and missile platforms for anti-ship, submarine and satellite warfare. Her powerful communications array and sensors are positioned 80 meters above the surface for the benefit of radar and subsurface monitoring. She can also support up to 12 standard carrier jets at one time, or 16 individual helijets/VTOL craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei has larger battlecruisers (the so-called super-battlecruisers match her height and are nearly twice her length) and much larger carriers, but the displacement of the vessel was never a priority. Vekllei’s naval architecture prioritises mobility and capability in their capital ships, and so the Oa-class vessels represent many intersecting vertices of Vekllei’s naval doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/images/canal.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atlantic Salmon was the best in the world&lt;/strong&gt;, and Vekllei had a lot of it. Ocean-going fishing boats brought their haul to Ro, where they cruised wide postwar canals and unloaded tonnes of shiny, bright salmon into processing plants. If a new factory was built, so too was a canal or a railroad. Nothing was trucked. Fish was traded fresh in markets or turned into emulsifiers and fertiliser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The canals were worked heavily, and few fishing vessels were incorporated. The vast majority of Vekllei’s fishing fleet was owned by the people that worked them, trading with the Sea Office. From a quaisiosn or “canal park” you might see a dozen vessels in an hour. Some were run-down prewar things limping out to the shallow coasts, while others were nuclear-powered salmon trawlers designed for the storms of the Atlantic. On the northern coast, the bigger boats were reinforced as ice-breakers. Fish was one of the few meats in the Vekllei diet that wasn’t grown in an industrial laboratory, a fact reflected in the scale of its infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canals are good for a city, and are good for the heart. Tzipora would take long walks in the morning along the Wellington Canal to where it met Touismah, then follow it to where it circled back into Lola. She would figure out what she was doing with her life as the boats departed for the day’s catch. She never much liked salmon, but she liked the boats. They were an island country, and their futures and pasts met in the sea — where it churned and swelled in their dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;aussie-thoughts-on-police-violence-new&#34;&gt;Aussie Thoughts on Police Violence [NEW]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BY HANGDOG#4510&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you lived under a rock&lt;/strong&gt;, you might be excused for missing the brutal murder of George Floyd. Unfortunately for you, America is the centre of all Earthly affairs, so the odds of the social media wildfire missing you are slim to none. But that’s okay, really, because at least it gives you something interesting to watch on the news, as a police station is torched or a wheelchair-bound hobo has his face blown open with a rubber bullet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we Australians say we are better than Americans? Absolutely. You’re 27 times more likely to be executed by a police officer in the States than you are here. Roughly 25% of the world’s prison population can be found in the ‘land of the free’, and it seems every single protest has resulted in someone losing an eye or being knocked into tomorrow. But are we perfect? Fuck to the no. Earlier this month, videos surfaced of a police officer sweeping the legs of an Indigenous youth in retaliation for a few measly swears. Almost a third of our prison population are Aboriginal Australian, despite accounting for just over 3% of our general population. That sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are our possible solutions? Currently the popular rhetoric is radical and reactionary, with #ACAB and #AbolishThePolice signaturing every ‘woke’ Twitter or Instagram post. These reductionist slogans do hold merit; it’s not the individual that is evil, it’s the policing institution as a whole. Money that is spent inflating the budgets of corrupt police departments and outfitting riot squads with military-grade hardware could be better spent on community solutions. We need to elevate communities from the material poverty which leads to crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question, then, is culture. Do we in the West have a social consciousness ready for community policing? Can we be sure that a decreased police presence will stop scenes like the Murray Hill Riots in Canada, where a police strike led to 16 hours of widespread looting? Can the West, and especially the Americans, really be trusted to govern themselves? This author thinks no. Excluding utopian socialist ideas that the root of all human evils is capitalism, tangible solutions are necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to be that the pragmatic approach is the strongest. Reforming police unions, holding officers accountable for crimes they commit on duty, and increase the standards necessary to wear the uniform and possess the badge. These sensible, attainable solutions would not only have immediate effects, but could have long term effects on American culture at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reform however cannot perfectly address the root of the issue with the police. The police do and always will be the only entity to possess a ‘legitimate’ monopoly on violence. There is no use boring you in an anarchist breakdown of the monopoly on violence and the danger of hierarchies, because some dead revolutionary from the last century has put it better in some dusty tome. Simply put, any hierarchical enforcement of law will always justify the use of violence. The key is examining culture and society, and deciding on meaningful compromise between an ideological ideal and a pragmatic policy. We can negotiate between what is and what ought, but no solution will be perfect. Laws are by their very nature imperfect and malleable, bound not to a higher authority but to a cultural identity. The aim is not utopia, but to possess something that is better than what we have today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;live-to-ride-harley-davidson-and-the-commodification-of-identity-new&#34;&gt;Live to Ride: Harley-Davidson and the Commodification of Identity [NEW]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BY CHEVALIERMALFET#1904&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The proof,” they say, “is in the pudding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ask a motorcyclist about Harley Davidson, you’ll get one of two answers. The people who don’t ride them scoff at them - heavy, dirty, clunky, and slow, Nixon-era dinosaurs inferior to both the Japanese standards and their own clones. If you ask a dedicated Harley rider, though, you get a different picture - they love their machines and their experiences riding them, and would never consider abandoning the company for a rival’s product. How has this company inspired such loyalty in spite of its terrible product?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I reach the point of this essay, fair is fair: Harley Davidson has an excellent customer service program and a wide network of dealers and mechanics. While this has nothing to do with the bikes themselves, it’s still a point in their favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the main point is simple. A man who buys a Harley isn’t simply getting a new vehicle - he (and it is almost always he) is buying a new identity. Because of Harley’s tireless marketing, he has a very clear image of the sort of person who owns one. Every bike sold comes with a ticket to a new sense of self, and a new life as a “Harley Guy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is the “Harley Guy?” Who does this new rider imagine he’ll become? 60 years ago, the Harley image was bound up with real antisocial behavior. The first wave of bikers were WW2 veterans, shell-shock cases unable to return to civilian life, and their bikes were military surplus. Hunter S. Thomson’s Hell’s Angels describes the titular gang shooting heroin and smashing up gas stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as the sixties wore on and the original bikers aged out or died off, Harley shifted its marketing. When its last domestic competitor went out of business, Harley wrapped itself in the flag and called itself the only choice for “Real Americans.” When Japan started selling small-displacement moped scooters, Harley touted its big bikes as the only choice for “Real Men.” When the automobile industry faced tighter safety regulations, Harley lobbied against helmet laws and called their buyers “Real Rebels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combine it together and a picture emerges: the “Harley Guy” may be out of step with square society, but he’s still a member of it - and its enemies are still his enemies. He might rebel against the rat race and the nanny state - especially when they want him to wear a helmet - but that’s because he’s channeling the purest essence of America, the cowboy spirit of an imaginary past. He salutes the troops and supports the police, and he always stands up for the national anthem. Most of all, he is a member of a group - the Harley brotherhood, a community of like-minded individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of the 80s, the American government protected Harley-Davidson with crushing tariffs. But those tariffs expired in 1988, and Harley was forced to fight the Japanese on even terms. Fighting bike-to-bike was impossible; the four Japanese OEMs were lean, mean, and honed to razors after 40 years of competition. Instead, Harley tripled-down on the marketing. The dealerships are apparel-shops, where customers can buy logo-branded shirts, bags, shot-glasses, and travel checkers sets. It has never been easier to show your identity - and your membership in the corporate family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most advertisers sell their product by selling the image of the person who owns it, but Harley-Davidson must be the most infamous, and obvious, example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-the-editor&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the Editor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the third issue of The &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;. This is the month of postcards, and feeling tired. There are fewer posts this month — and aside from &lt;em&gt;Vekllei’s Race for Inefficiency&lt;/em&gt;, they’ve all been pretty tepid stuff. There’s good reason for that, and hopefully we’ll be back to regular production next month. And the postcards are currently making their way around the world — how exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where do we go from here? Am I just going to continue grinding out posts for the rest of this year? Well, possibly. But the theme of the last few editions, and of which July is no exception, is the “future” of this project — preparing to finally make Vekllei something “real&amp;quot;. Worldbuilding is fine — but storytelling is a great human talent, and I would like to tell stories in Vekllei. I’m a bit boxed in, at times — distracted by nice things like postcards and university study, as well as regular posts and sketches — but I want to start something big. &lt;strong&gt;I want to start a comic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expect news next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the global pandemic has subsumed all of us into the surreal, and a lot of us lucky enough to be unaffected by Coronavirus are simply floating around, grasping for meaning and purpose in a world that seems as though a cosmic bit flipped somewhere after 2001. I’m sure I’m not the only one who, months into lockdown, is starting to find the abyss staring back at me. I think the way out of it is to draw more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading, and I&amp;rsquo;d also like to thank the contributor to this edition, Mtirado, for their essay. If you would like to contribute to The Atlantic with writing, art or reviews relevant to the spirit of petticoat ideology, please contact Hobart at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:melonkony@icloud.com&#34;&gt;melonkony@icloud.com&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;strong&gt;31st of August&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for supporting Vekllei, and best wishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hobart Phillips
&lt;strong&gt;Enjoy — 楽しんで&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Postcards have been sent! Finally — this was a mammoth task. Six illustrations back-to-back doesn’t sound like much, but I’m no good at doing the same thing over and over. Shipping may take up to four weeks because of the coronavirus pandemic, so hopefully everyone will have theirs by August. Let me know if you don’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have purchased some nice watercolour brushes for my digital workflow, and so you’ll see some rough edges in my work for a while as I learn how to use them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Absolutely no work has been done on the website. It’s a shame, but it’s a matter of time. It was always going to be a long-term, big-payoff project and when it’s done, it’ll be spectacular. Hopefully August treats it better.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-tzipora-watch&#34;&gt;II. Tzipora-watch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was in July that Tzipora first met Ayn’s parents, who would quickly assume a role in Tzipora’s life as her own grandparents. Ayn’s mother, Ana, is Soviet-Born, and her father, Tony, is a Hong-Konger. Despite her international heritage, Ayn is afraid of both the sea and the sky and has never left Vekllei’s shores. Tzipora looks forward to spending part of the summer in Yana with Ayn and her grandparents each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii-vekllei-fact-of-the-month&#34;&gt;III. Vekllei Fact of the Month&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei’s heavy diet of lab-grown meat, called ‘factory steak’ or &lt;em&gt;eoui demanufacturie&lt;/em&gt; is so widespread in cities that many children in the capital region have never eaten meat from a living creature. Its texture and taste, especially after processing, is identical to beef and comes in different forms to replicate different cuts of meat, including fat and gristle. Most ‘real’ meat in Vekllei cities consists of sweetbreads, offcuts and organs — the stuff left over from authentic rural consumption of the prime cuts. Chicken hearts, for example, are eaten by themselves or on a skewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iv-wordbook&#34;&gt;IV. WordBook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iyadaisnesn&lt;/strong&gt; — also called “Insta-skin” is a collagen scaffold that rapidly seals and then regenerates skin over wounds. It is used medicinally in Vekllei, where it is branded as &lt;em&gt;Iyadaisnesn&lt;/em&gt;, and is usually aerosolised and applied to shallow scrapes and grazes to seal the wound and prevent infection. Within a few days, it’s good as new! A type of Insta-skin is also used by the military, where it is distributed in wet pouches and acts much faster on much more serious wounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📖 Published 31st July 2020 |&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/i1fgjd/meet_tzipora_concept_panel_for_a_vekllei_comic/&#34;&gt;Read here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/images/tziporacon.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are a lot of things Tzipora does differently to everybody else&lt;/strong&gt;, and they start to make a lot more sense when you realise Tzipora either does not &lt;em&gt;realise&lt;/em&gt; she is unusual, or does not &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has a lot of endearing characteristics that give great character to her mannerisms and physicality. She has a small overbite that makes her look a little froggy, and ritually pulls on her shirt and wipes her nose in anxious conversation. She is round-headed and cuts her hair herself. She talks in a low, expressive voice. She has been poorly socialised in childhood, and is afraid of casual conversation with people she does not know. She is keenly socially attuned and feels awkwardness painfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wears the same clothes two or three days in a row. The outfits themselves are variations of the same thing, and her tastes don’t change. Everything hangs off her — she likes baggy, airy clothing, and upsizes to accomodate. She doesn’t like fashionable or voguish people, whom she regards as decadent and offensive. To Tzipora, taste is timeless and bound to the soul. In her case, this fact has held true — she has dressed the same as childhood, and very little else has changed about her in that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is paranoid and conservative, good-natured and austere, with a moral outlook bound by her deepest anxieties and obsessions. She is deeply spiritual and material, fascinated with objects and their history. She has many collections of many things she’s found. She’ll likely die a Catholic, but has a confrontational relationship with God and no longer attends mass, as a declaration of humanism. She does not know if this has pissed Him off, but it’s working out so far. Maybe that’s why He made her a homosexual — to get back at her. He must have a good sense of humour, if that’s the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora may be intense and inward-facing, but she can also be disarmingly charming and self-deprecating. She has a good sense of humour. There are not many girls that can so easily reconcile the contradictions between the peculiar and the healthy, the eccentric and the friendly, and the violent and the domestic. That’s part of her character — an essence of being that radiates decency, good taste and a respect for the spirit of all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Azores had been a possession of Vekllei since 2002&lt;/strong&gt;, when they were leased from Portugal indefinitely. The lease was defunct by the time of Vekllei’s independence from U.K. occupation in 2015, and the new state took formal ownership over the small Atlantic islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Azores was Vekllei’s resort region, often called simply the “holiday isles”. Brief reprieves from the North Atlantic cold were granted to hundreds of thousands domestic tourists each year in resorts and holiday rentals alike. Tzipora spent the summer of 2079 there. Good memories were made in that summer. She did not much like the beach but she liked the ocean. If she could retire, it would be in the Azore&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The puffin scouts set up camp not far from the rest, just outside of Krafla in the Lava region. When they moved south tomorrow, thick native grasses and trees would give way to flower-tundras and bare hills, and by Tuesday they’d be in the heart of Lava — empty and extraterrestrial and volcanic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Krafla high-energy communications tower was visible from all over the region. It provided uninterrupted radio to most of North Lava, and could relay signals through satellites. In another country, it might have been considered a blight on a pristine view — but in Vekllei, there was no such thing as pristine. It was as much a part of the landscape as the trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They started the fire first, figuring they’d have more enthusiasm for the tent when they were warm. Warm sunrays played on the field-grasses around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tziporas-every-day-carry&#34;&gt;Tzipora’s ‘Every Day Carry’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📖 Published 20th July 2020 |&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/hu6k92/tziporas_every_day_carry/&#34;&gt;Read here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/images/edc.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like a lot of girls of poverty&lt;/strong&gt;, Tzipora was very possessive of her things. No food was ever left on her plate. There was a deep anxiety that whatever wasn’t claimed would be lost. She was also naturally obsessive and material-oriented, keenly aware of the importance of objects measured by metrics in her own silly head. You can discover a lot about a person from their trinkets and toys — let’s discover a bit about Tzipora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her handbag is manufactured by Spaa S.p.A., a design firm in the capital. They’re a luxury item in the international market but readily available in Vekllei, since few other handbag makers operate on the scale of Spaa. Ayn picked it out shortly after Tzipora’s arrival for its colour, after Tzipora told her she did not own any red things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora has a sweet tooth. Especially for soda, which she calls “fizzy drink”. On her person at any time, she carries a flavoured beverage from one of several brands capable of meeting her discerning tastes. She supplements them with a water bottle, since not even fizzy drink refreshes as well as water after phys-ed or a hot day. She also stocks her arsenal of snacks with good fruit picked off trees that overhang footpaths, as well as devastating salvos of Vekllei’s finest confectionary, including Fruit Tingles and chocolate pearls. Other girls in her class bemoan her childish metabolism as she drinks soda for lunch while they watch the scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nostalgic whimsy of the sweets is tempered by two or three loose cigarettes that float around in her purse at any given time. She’s not a regular smoker, but she’s prone to attacks related to stress, and nothing helps as much as a drag. She carries matches, for not much reason other than that’s what Baron uses, and Tzipora is notoriously sentimental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora has a rock collection that sits on her bedroom sill, and her recent additions sit at the bottom of her purse. She’s not a rock elitist; quartz from footpaths catches her attention as easily as igneous treasures like palagonite. Her favourite is obsidian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She carries a small collection of useful books, including a contemporary paperback and a notebook. The paperback is for recess and lunch; the notebook is for language notes and phone numbers. Her Vekllei I.D. papers, which are both a passport and a reference booklet of key information and services, are carried on her at all times. It’s not really necessary in day-to-day life — but who knows when it might be, and Tzipora won’t be the one patting her pockets at the airport gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are a few accessories sitting in the bag. Tzipora made a ring for Cobian in metalworking class, but Cobian is on a school trip to France at the moment and Tzipora is waiting for her return. She has a wristwatch given to her by Baron, which she wears sometimes depending on the occasion. Other items are more precautionary — a scarf for the wind, a handkerchief for sneezing, and a spare pair of socks for when she visits Cobian’s house or if she needs to double up in cold weather. As summer turns to autumn, she also carries gloves and a beanie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With everything in its place, her handbag is her anchor in the world outside her small second-floor apartment. The decommodification of society has only intensified the social value of objects, and they remain as important as ever in the life of the ordinary Vekllei person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/images/economy.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;smallimg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;overview-of-the-bureau-system&#34;&gt;Overview of the Bureau System&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are many thousands of companies busy with work in Vekllei&lt;/strong&gt;. The vast majority of these companies are single-person shops (S.p.A., or &lt;em&gt;senrouiva pettetie anaproiouya&lt;/em&gt;). Also common are wobbly shops, or co-operative businesses (S.q.A., or &lt;em&gt;senrouiva qualitie anaproiouya&lt;/em&gt;). The largest of the non-bureau companies are village factories (S.p.M., or &lt;em&gt;senrouiva persimonaya manufacturie&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bureau-level world is full of company mastheads that emphasise modernity, dynamism and progress. Vekllei’s “private businesses”, however, tend to be local in taste. The vast majority of S.p.A. and S.q.A. businesses bear the family names of their founders — Desmesyo S.p.A., Risyiouisnesn Home Machines S.q.A., etc. Their legal denominations are almost always affixed to the end of their nameplates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;em&gt;senrouiva&lt;/em&gt; designation marks them as non-bureau businesses. A &lt;em&gt;bureau&lt;/em&gt;, as a reminder, is simply the top-level organisation of a trade union that organises business in the country. In practice, it means that a company is responsible to the political organs of the country. Although independent from the government, bureau business is inextricably entwined in government concern and runs parallel to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Senrouvia&lt;/em&gt; businesses are also part of the bureau structure, but are in practice not managed directly by them. They are usually united in local concern by so-called &lt;em&gt;petty bureaus&lt;/em&gt;; small cooperative organs that safeguard local interest and business. These petty bureaus are often at odds with the bureau organs proper, and so even though they are part of the same structure, they are fundamentally political opposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is sort of business goes on in a bureau proper?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two common categories of so-called “bureau firms”. You have state industries (S.A., or &lt;em&gt;societie indastrie&lt;/em&gt;), which deal with manufacturing and exploitation of resources that require direct management by a public organ. You’ll already be familiar with several — General Reactor S.A., Comen Aeroyards S.A., Farmer’s Syndicate S.A. to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also have state requisites (A.r., or &lt;em&gt;requoisesiasn amourisocietie&lt;/em&gt;), which refer to the vast government-operated organs made up six categories primarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilities (A.r.Un.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transport (A.r.R.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Education (A.r.E.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local healthcare (A.r.F.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Construction (A.r.Lo.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automation (A.r.M.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes — education is not organised as a government department, but a bureau business. Other state responsibilities are folded directly into government departments — war, intelligence, healthcare, police, fire, and the mint are all managed directly by the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;argument&#34;&gt;Argument&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the legal division of enterprise laid out, let us examine again the four precepts of the Vekllei economic ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-management and self-interest through Sundress Municipalism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classification of property as an independent social organ, like nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abolishment of currency and currency-substitutes. Participatory employment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economic feminisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These four principles reveal a great deal about the character of the country, and stand largely at face value. There is an interest in chasing the promises of modernity while deconstructing its metaphysical constructions, through the abolishment of exchange-value, property and the overhaul of gender-economics. There are anarchist gestures in each principle, yet it is obvious that the product of these values complexify the conventional anarchist imagination. This is part of a series of contradictions — between free and planned markets, between internationalism and provinciality, between man and woman, between freedom and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;austerity&#34;&gt;Austerity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bureau system is plagued by inefficiencies, arising from logistic systems premised on warehousing, poor Coasean bargaining between petty bureaus and proper bureaus, a political emphasis on macroeconomic outcomes, a decoupling of aggregate demand and national economic output, cultural intolerance for Pareto inefficiencies, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luxury goods often vary in both supply and access, and economies are often severely localised to the point of provincialism, meaning that Vekllei has failed to transition reliably to a modern consumer society. The inhabitants of the Montre borough most often eat seafood because speciality meats, especially authentic red meat, are scarce. The opposite is true in Yana. Clothes are repaired and regifted, appliances are available only from regional outlets usually located in the same city as the factory, and culture and diet are fiercely regional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, in part, a result of unflinching national austerity and the sublimation of artificial markets prompted by Vekllei’s gold-based auxiliary currency, which necessitates meeting debt obligations for its strength internationally. There is a belief in Vekllei that the wealth of the country allowed the abolition of the currency — in fact, the opposite is true. The abolition of currency allows a permanent wealth that compensates for the inefficiencies of the bureau system. The bureau firms do not pay their workers — on paper, there are no expenses for anything beyond raw commodity exchange. This is how Vekllei’s largest companies — and, per the bureau system, its government — remain solvent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Austerity&lt;/em&gt; is a cultural force, too — the scarcity of luxury goods inflates their social value, where comforts and necessities are largely abundant in automation. It creates an unimportant hardship that keeps Vekllei people forward-facing, lean, and ambitious. To acquire Picco S.p.A.’s iconic lounge chairs, you have to travel to their outlet in Horn, hundreds of kilometres from the capital area. There is no motivation for a craftsman to meet demand — there is no petty consumption, either. To own a Picco chair means you have understood its cultural value, utility and craftsmanship, and have made the effort to find and transport one to your home. Inconvenience, and by extension, austerity, is celebrated as a “trial of ownership.” Objects are very important in Vekllei, and craftsmanship is highly valued, and so people like to surround themselves with hand-made, sublime things wrought not just by the labour of the artisan, but their own effort to acquire it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petty &lt;em&gt;austerity&lt;/em&gt; instills a national sentiment that tells the ordinary Vekllei person they are hardier than the ordinary American or European, even if the wealth of the ordinary Vekllei person is much greater than that of the ordinary American or European.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;apathy&#34;&gt;Apathy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a vast, loosely organised private market in the &lt;em&gt;senrouiva&lt;/em&gt; categorisation, Vekllei does not reward entrepreneurial ambition. Ambitious people are funnelled into positions of power in bureau firms and political office, but the founding of S.p.As and S.q.As is rarely motivated by a desire for influence or power. Indeed, artisanal S.p.As are often incapable of the sort of economies of scale needed for expansion. Vekllei instead relies on a sort of economic &lt;em&gt;apathy&lt;/em&gt;, in which aggregate demand and productivity are spurned for immediate interest and pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ensures that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;luxury products remain creative, personal works per Upen’s insistence on the symbiosis of labour and product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the private senrouiva market is not capable of threatening the provincialism of Sundress Municipalism, which might make a commodity universally accessible and threaten to introduce generic consumer society into Vekllei life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the private senrouiva market under petty bureau organisation does not threaten the organised de facto monopolies of the bureau companies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Vekllei has replaced the commodity with the object, then it is through economic apathy that they have ensured objects will never again become commodities. Just as the ordinary Vekllei person is apolitical, so too are they apathetic towards change in their purchasing habits, favouring small, inconvenient and personal brands over those exploiting aggregate demand. In a sense, this also contributed to the popular Vekllei term &lt;em&gt;product atheism&lt;/em&gt;, in which the metaphysics of products are dismantled and rearranged into social forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, the &lt;em&gt;apathy&lt;/em&gt; is found on both ends — within the &lt;em&gt;senrouiva&lt;/em&gt; business owner, who is provided little upward mobility to satisfy ambition beyond local and regional expansion, and within the consumer, who recognises products only within cultural and social dimensions. Neither is conducive to a functioning, fair market on an interregional scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;play&#34;&gt;Play&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Play&lt;/em&gt; is the foundational motivation of most work in Vekllei. There are existential motivators, too — a desire to wield power, or professional legacy — but in many professions it is &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; by which a Vekllei person justifies labour. It is also why work is fiercely protected by petty bureaus and other labour organisations — work is their connection to wider society, and that connection is held sacred in Upen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is through work as &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; that Vekllei is able to justify the employment of children. Financial motivations for work have all but disappeared — in its place, the workplace has to convince people to work. There are few state protections for businesses unable to maintain a workforce, either — it is one of the most common reasons for the shuttering of a company. The boss must convince his workers to stay, and so a total inversion of power has occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In place of money, there is prestige, and in prestige there is myth. Few people have genuine interest in Fordism. Many more are attracted to the hand-crafted furniture of Picco S.p.A., and becoming recognised as a builder of great things. In a sense, a person “acts out” the role of a craftsman, in the same way a person “acts out” the role of a police officer, or “acts out” life as a pilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this system, the childish spirit of recreation, duty and “the adult world” is acted out by millions of Vekllei people each day. Seeds planted by a child play-acting as a farmer continue to grow, and so too does the Vekllei economy feed its population through the intersection of fantasy and labour. At this point it is obvious that &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; is not fantasy at all, but in fact a motivation for labour as genuine as profit. Where it falls short, in hard, disempowering jobs, it is automated and conscripted through the mandatory service system. As it is often described:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The &lt;em&gt;Bureau System&lt;/em&gt; is labour-intensive where wanted, alleviated by industrial machinery where preferred, and automated where necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its wake are states of &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt;, and through play comes a decent framework for living, obvious in the basic satisfaction of the Vekllei people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;police-in-vekllei&#34;&gt;Police in Vekllei&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📖 Published 8th July 2020 |&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/hmz7af/police_in_vekllei/&#34;&gt;Read here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/images/police.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;smallimg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are two regular police organs in Vekllei.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fedecenoayan porits (national police, or &lt;em&gt;venopor&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comoisniyan denporitsa (local police, or &lt;em&gt;cosmopor&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A young &lt;em&gt;venopor&lt;/em&gt; officer stands on the left, in the full street regalia they’re renowned for. Unlike &lt;em&gt;cosmopor&lt;/em&gt; they often carry machine guns while on patrol and are stationed outside of government buildings, hospitals, train stations, ports, schools and any company managed directly by a bureau, which is a trade organ of national importance. They are special units of special purpose, and supplement the deficiencies of local policing through their training and tactical deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are police insofar as they protect and respond to their community, including through special tactics situations, but are paramilitary in their wider function as a defence force for critical infrastructure. This is reflected in their history, traced cleanly back past independence and the Atomic War to the royal guards and junta federal police of old society, which continue to be reflected in their uniforms and several other ceremonial artefacts, like swords and knee boots. Venopor is a complex organisation with many different purposes. There are street patrols, pictured here, but there are also intelligence units associated with HO/NI and by extension the military, as well as tactical response teams, bomb squads, search and rescue and most other specialised emergency units outside of the capabilities of any given local police station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is contrast to the &lt;em&gt;cosmopor&lt;/em&gt;, a more conventional police outfit. A cosmopor officer stands on the right, in standard summer uniform. He carries a radio, revolver and rubber baton for the worst of his duties, and is embedded deep into his local community. Cosmopor officers traditionally visit and introduce themselves to each house in their beat, and spend far more of their time mediating, counselling and organising than they do making arrests. The autonomy of most Vekllei communities largely spurns petty legal proceedings, and so the cosmopor are a critical aspect of sundress municipalism, resolving disputes personally and taking custody of a person only when it’s needed. Most crime in Vekllei tends to be emotionally motivated — so it is in this domain that cosmopor navigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes the cosmopor especially powerful figures in a Vekllei village or township, but their duties are closely watched. While the Vekllei village may be autonomous, all officers in Vekllei are responsible to a division of venopor called “officer welfare,” or picosec, which operates autonomously to seek out incompetent or misbehaving police officers, no matter their jurisdiction or status. Where most business in Vekllei has very little in the way of professional behaviour or “work culture”, policing in Vekllei is held to high standards, and they are severely bound by traditions that have become codified as the country has grown. This is a time and place where the children of police often inherit the jobs of their parents, and the constables of a village often have roots that go back centuries. This often makes cosmopor very respected figures, and their successors and recruits are expected to work for that respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a country that has done away with money as a measure of success, professional legacy is profoundly important in Vekllei. In this inversion of priority, teachers, doctors, pilots, constables and librarians are celebrated. This is not founded in a general egalitarianism, but in fact the precise opposite — a celebration of success and influence, touching the lives of those around them. The glamour, and paycheque, has largely been stripped away. Only the work remains, and so that work has become more important than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-you-should-love-your-computer-independence-and-control-through-free-software-new&#34;&gt;Why you should love your computer: Independence and control through free software [NEW]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BY MTIRADO#2460&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you feel proud when you turn on your computer? Do you feel satisfied with your favourite software&amp;rsquo;s user experience? Nowadays technology, specially I.T., is getting more and more intertwined with our daily lives. Each year we rely more and more on it and at the same time, layers upon layers of abstraction are being placed to simplify its usage and impede our understanding of its inner workings. Social media, web services, software and devices that we use daily offer us an intuitive and simple experience at the cost of giving up any sort of control or fine-tuning. Take a look at computers for example — your average desktop or laptop. For many people, their computer is just another tool; a complicated, scary, cumbersome tool. Plagued with viruses, weird pop-ups, and painful slowness. If you dare to turn on your slow, noisy computer, it&amp;rsquo;s because you had to print some documents or fill out an online form. So you just open MS Office Word, and/or Google Chrome, and forget everything else, because clicking on any other icon will render your computer useless. Even if it&amp;rsquo;s fast and sleek, computers are still a mystery. Then, outside of our comfort zone, there lies the stuff of tech specialists, hackers, and hobbyists. Even if you&amp;rsquo;re a tech enthusiast that keeps up with the latest gadgets and updates, your user experience is still dependent on the decisions of a single organisation or company that does not usually tolerate decentralisation. We do not have enough control over the products we own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were computers always meant to be used like this? Like a black box that&amp;rsquo;s hard to open and understand — hard to make it ours? Mainstream operating systems and software give us the promise of an experience that just works — if we go all in on their ecosystems. Their software and utilities are easy to use and intuitive, but hard to understand and control. If you want to customize how your favorite program renders a different type of file, good luck with that. If you want to do something that&amp;rsquo;s slightly outside the program&amp;rsquo;s intended purpose, no one can help you. Future updates are controlled by a small, concentrated group. You can never know what goes on under the hood if you can&amp;rsquo;t open the hood. You can never know how something works if there&amp;rsquo;s no need to read the manual. These days, privacy concerns are greater than ever, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;amp;tl=en&amp;amp;u=https://www.xataka.com.mx/legislacion-y-derechos/reparar-tu-smartphone-instalarle-rom-sera-delito-mexico-nueva-ley-que-proteje-candados-digitales-explicada&#34;&gt;smartphones are getting harder and harder to tamper with&lt;/a&gt;, using proprietary software and assembly techniques that make repair difficult. We learn to accept and embrace the software that comes bundled with our computer and we shudder when we realise we need to fix a problem ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;rsquo;s the alternative?, How are we supposed to strengthen the relationship between the user and the tool when we are told to accept that computers are hard to understand and control, and that abstraction is necessary? This is where free (‘free&#39; as in ‘freedom&#39;), open source software becomes relevant. Open source software gives the user privacy, flexibility, control, and choice. A wide variety of open source software caters to the nerdiest of power users and the casual users that only needs to browse the web and print some documents alike. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to read the code. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to learn a programming language to be able to regain independence and control of your computer. Free software like Linux has come a long way, and is now more user friendly than ever. You shouldn’t have to choose between ease-of-use and open source software — and with Linux, it’s no longer a trade-off. Installing a new OS, tinkering with your machine, following tutorials to customise the UI, and making a website not only gives you have a deeper understanding of how your computer and technology works, it helps change your perception of computing and your relationship with technology in general. Using software that encourages you to modify and customise gives you control and independence that no proprietary software can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t promise you that you won’t face problems using open source software, because that&amp;rsquo;s simply not true. Sometimes we can&amp;rsquo;t leave proprietary software altogether. No software is perfect, just as no tool is perfect. But at least free software gives you the opportunity to make a better tool, if you&amp;rsquo;re willing to sharpen it, willing to read through the documentation, willing to work and get your hands dirty with configuration files to solve a problem, and of course, willing to fail. The reward goes beyond having your computer work just as you want it: you end up with a tool, a product that is truly yours — something you can feel proud of, tangible and meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does that mean that we should struggle every time we use our computer? Absolutely not. But we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t always strive to make technology easy to use, but instead try and make it easy to understand. Because if you&amp;rsquo;re able to make sense of things and truly know what&amp;rsquo;s going on, ease of use will come naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. If you&amp;rsquo;re thinking about switching to Linux, my personal recommendation is &lt;a href=&#34;https://linuxmint.com/&#34;&gt;Linux Mint&lt;/a&gt;. I recently installed it on a laptop and automatically detected Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and all network printers. No driver download required. It&amp;rsquo;s ready to use out of the box and highly customisable. And remember, you can keep Linux and your current operating system in the same computer if you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-the-editor&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the Editor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the fourth issue of The &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;. Good posts this month. Bit of a smorgasbord, with stories covering all sorts of things. Most importantly, as was mentioned last month: &lt;strong&gt;I want to start a comic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you go about starting a comic? I don’t think there’s much of a trick to it, as a first-timer — you just have to ’start’. It’s difficult for me, not just because I’m still learning to draw, but also because a comic in the Vekllei format should help the utopian ’social dream’ of the project — that’s what the “author” category of posts means. So a comic would not just have to tell an exciting story with a linear plot and action — it would have to be immersive; a guide to the world; something you could revisit time and time again without needing to follow a linear story. Figuring out how to do that is complicated. I’ll set aside some time in September to start exploring this concept seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d also like to do a short animation/music video for a bit of fun. 80s technopunk vapourwave irony aesthetics are last year — what about a bit of postwar austerity to anticipate the coming global recession? Forget bright-coloured sneakers and Windows 98 interfaces — how about some council housing and cardigans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess we’ll have to wait and see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading, and I&amp;rsquo;d also like to thank the contributor to this edition, Bike (Milky), for their wonderful essay on Vekllei ecofeminism. It’s an excellent read — check it out below. If you would like to contribute to The Atlantic with writing, art or reviews relevant to the spirit of petticoat ideology, please contact Hobart at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:melonkony@icloud.com&#34;&gt;melonkony@icloud.com&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;strong&gt;30th of September.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for supporting Vekllei, and best wishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hobart Phillips
&lt;strong&gt;Enjoy — 楽しんで&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-news--announcements&#34;&gt;I. News &amp;amp; Announcements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve gone back to work at the news organ I used to work at — I might have a little less time, but I’ll have a little more money, and that’s nice. Hoping to draw more in September, riding off the fun I had in August.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wiki (called Zelda Wiki — good luck buying any domain with the word “Zelda” in it) is coming along well. Rather than writing every article in advance — a leviathan task — I’m preparing a few intro  covering the country of Vekllei and the characters of my story. It’s live now — but good luck finding the URL for it. It’ll be done before the end of the year, but it’s not nearly finished yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The post “Absolute Quiet” really took off on reddit and netted me nearly another 1,000 subscribers on r/vekllei. Awesome! It’s not hard to cross-post work and it pays off, especially as I get better. This piece worked out really well — if only I could paint cities as nicely. That’s a long-term ambition, unfortunately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The website is “functional” in big scare-quotes. It’s just a blog replicating reddit posts for now — that’ll change once the wiki is complete and accessible. The parallax isn’t cropped properly on mobile and there’s a few errors with icons loading in, but it’s better than the broken hub with no content that was there before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a reminder, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.millmint.net&#34;&gt;www.millmint.net&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vekllei.com&#34;&gt;www.vekllei.com&lt;/a&gt; now redirect to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.millmint.studio&#34;&gt;www.millmint.studio&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-tzipora-watch&#34;&gt;II. Tzipora-watch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August of 2067, Tzipora wrote to the office of the Sun-Cola Beverage Company professing a love of their soda. The letter was so heartfelt and congratulatory that the chief operations officer invited her to tour their bottling plant in Demon, during which she met several of the staff responsible for her favourite flavours. They sent her home with a basketful of Sun-Cola merchandise and a wristwatch shaped like a bottle cap that still works to this day. Tzipora made a habit of writing to her favourite companies, and as a result has visited a lot of places of industry the ordinary person might never think to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii-vekllei-fact-of-the-month&#34;&gt;III. Vekllei Fact of the Month&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the prevalence of nuclear power in Vekllei, over 60 per cent of the country’s civil power is produced by geothermal and hydroelectric power stations. This is in part a result of &lt;em&gt;Upen&lt;/em&gt;’s intuitive emphasis on renewable local resources (not just for sustainability, but for deep integration and dependence with the physical landscape), but also because much of Vekllei’s nuclear power is sold abroad via undersea powerlines in Europe and the United States, to supplement ageing fission plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iv-wordbook&#34;&gt;IV. WordBook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endoanotetmouisa&lt;/strong&gt; — translates literally as “Princess belonging to the Earth,” often mistranslated as “Princess of the Earth”. A highly uncomfortable nickname given to Tzipora in a news article written about her, shortly after her first mainstream appearance — a student documentary about building her house in Montre-Lola. Her interviews in the film sparked widespread interest in the girl, both for her medical condition and her extraordinary childhood, and so she spent much of the summer of 2083 in the Azores trying avoid this nickname.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the morning of the second day, I watched a fly crawl across the cheek of the middle-aged woman, probably an office worker, lying next to me. It moved up her cheekbone to her temple, stopping now and then to rub its front legs as though performing a ritual.
A jagged tear ran down the leg of her dark blue work trousers, but the white calf it revealed was miraculously unscathed. The woman lay still. Probably dead, I assumed. After a while, the fly got on to her eyelid. Suddenly, she reached up and brushed it away, opening the eye. There was still a moist light inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From &lt;em&gt;Insects&lt;/em&gt;, by Seirai Yūichi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By chance, the glass paperweight had survived. When her in-laws’ house had burnt down in Yokohama, the paperweight was among those things that she’d frantically stuffed into an emergency bag, and now it was her only souvenir of life in her girlhood home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From evening on, in the alley, she could hear the strange cries of the neighbourhood girls. Rumour had it that they could make a thousand yen in a single night. Now and then she would find herself holding the forty-sen paperweight she had bought after ten days of indecision when she was these girls’ age, and as she studied the sweet little dog in relief, she would realise with a shock that there was not a single dog left in the whole burnt-out neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From &lt;em&gt;The Silver Fifty-Sen Pieces&lt;/em&gt;, by Kawabata Yasunari&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the 14th of August 2111&lt;/strong&gt;, the Atomic War began in a Chinese submarine in the South Pacific, and ended six hours later. The war marks the single greatest loss of life in human history and would disrupt human life on Earth in previously unimaginable ways — consumer society bottomed out, the world became small, the Earth grew cold, and a new chapter in human history was opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This political map marks the territories of Earth as they stand five years on, in 2116. There are fewer countries in the world today than in any other point in human history, in part because the catastrophic reduction in human population — some 520-600 millions in the first year — has emptied out countries and rendered others uninhabitable. Many of these territories here are disputed and, in some cases, autonomous — for simplicity, they are presented as they are recognised by the U.N.
The map also presents a long-exposure view of the war as it happened, and its remaining fallout currents today. Red dots mark significant nuclear detonations on August 14th. Yellow dots mark surface warfare in some capacity. Red trails mark missile flight, reduced in number here by strict denuclearisation treaties of the decades previous. Yellow trails mark the flight paths of atomic bombers, both supersonic and subsonic. This map does not record failed launches, intercepted missiles or downed aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fighting was arranged along political axes — namely Western (U.S., U.K., West Germany &amp;amp; N.A.T.O. members), Warsaw Pact (U.S.S.R., Cuba, Egypt), East Asian (China &amp;amp; Korea), and non-aligned (Vekllei, France, Brazil). The war experience was unique to each country — Vekllei exchanged warheads and bombs with China but not Warsaw countries, the U.S.S.R. exchanged with both Western and East Asian members, and Brazil fought a catastrophic war against both Soviet and American territories. The immediate aftermath saw a quiet Earth, much of it scorched. Temperatures dropped by 10 degrees centigrade for the first six months, and slowly warmed as debris cleared in the following years. Wide-scale firestorms were tempered by rains that followed the war shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some 274 millions of the dead are accounted for in China, where in 2116 the cities still lie in rot, swollen with corpses; heavy with miasma; concrete dams bleached and cracked; the wood all burned up; the rivers warped and quiet; dead fish along them; a surfaced water main weeping blood; harsh asbestine whistling; railcars in a ditch; sloughing skin; tremors; smoke with no fires; confused wandering; bleeding from the inside; families-as-sand; sand-as-trinitite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exchanges were confused, helter-skelter, and the combatants rattle off like a death snare. The U.S.S.R., the U.S., France, and Vekllei all exchanged death with China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would take more than mere annihilation to extinguish the P.R.C., but the toll was nauseating. Beijing and Shanghai were simply disappeared; there was nothing where there once was. The fistfuls of rebar and concrete amidst glassy, ossified landscape were heaped into direct administration of the U.N. The following year, 40-120 million more Chinese would succumb to the greatest famine in the history of the world. Of course, in the U.N., there was good argument for the nuclear retaliation — China launched first; why should money and food go to the perpetrator of the vastest disaster in human history? One can’t help but wonder if the life of an Oriental coolie wells fewer tears than his equivalent in Paris. There are not enough flowers in the world to pay tribute to the dead of China, who were simply dispensed with in European memory and subsumed in part by the United Nations. The communist party would continue to control the vast interior, divided into two states by ethnography, where 1949 seemed closer than ever. Necrotic politics are legitimised in the land of the dead.
Soon, we saw the consolidation of nation-states into geographic regions with a disregard for ethnography not seen since the colonial years. This was met with violent resistance in some places — in others, locals capitulated to the extraordinary hyperreality of the postwar world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Nations was quickly catapulted into the status of a de facto administrative world government in a last-ditch attempt to ‘freeze time’ as it were, in order to provide the superpowers time to recover from the scope of immediate devastation and prevent humanity from entering a long period of decline. This involved the moving of soldiers on a scale unseen since the World Wars, as U.N. international brigades propped up vulnerable, scorched territories in Central/Western Europe and Asia. The immediate peace of the first days after the war was ruthlessly enforced — and strategic opportunism was threatened to meet indiscriminate violence and U.N.-sanctioned nuclear retaliation. There was some belief that the status quo could carry on. So troops of non-combatant countries were supplied, and in some cases press-ganged, into this global mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battered United States, acknowledging its ‘century of decline’, found itself consolidating control over its urban, though devastated, coasts. The awkward appellation &amp;ldquo;Dallas America&amp;rdquo; was used as a colloquial shorthand for a disputed territory that insisted on referring to itself as the legitimate United States. The name was only superseded by the ridiculous &amp;ldquo;United Nations Heartlands of the United States,&amp;rdquo; the Aid Region of the U.S. interior that had collapsed in the days after the war. This was buffered by the Mojave and Great Lakes Special Administrative Regions, federal territories that contained war industry and nuclear infrastructure that propped up the precarious coasts. Despite efforts to revive agriculture in the scorched U.N. Heartlands U.S., starvation was met with martial law along the coasts the following year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.N. was granted temporary, direct control over several collapsed territories that had either succumbed to nuclear fire or had caved to anarchy in the weeks and months after. In some cases, like the U.N. regions in Hawaii, Jerusalem and the Central Europe International War Government, these behaved as states in themselves, administrated directly by the United Nations Mission for War Recovery. In others, they were merely named as such with the vague promise of future aid. U.N. Cuba and U.N. Taiwan were such examples, in which devastation had been so catastrophic that little remained to govern, and the local population was mostly left to anarchy. In general, there were great inequalities in how the U.N. chose to dedicate resources, largely informed by its largest nation-states and political interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are thousands of stories from communities and territories across the world directly impacted by the war — from the atomic bombing of Sydney to the catastrophic reactor meltdowns of Brazil’s south. The war was unprecedented in scale and devastation. This map reveals little of the profoundly human tragedy that was brought about, nor does it invoke the difficult existential artefacts that are still being reckoned with. Perhaps humans are just animals after all — destined to die out the way so many have in this age. Most tragic was not the colossal scale of death, or the collapse and pain that followed, but the upending of domestic society into violence, in which people of consumer society — the middle class — found themselves with not much at all, thrust into a world of chaos and suffering in which all prior epistemologies evaporated. Like the flash of blue light that preceded the roar, it was the stuff in supermarkets and department stores that marked the absolute grotesqueing of life in the new age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m Hobart. I’ve been working on this project for a while now. It doesn’t really have a purpose or an end goal — I just want to draw and write about nice things, and I’m learning a lot on the way.
Welcome to everyone new here. I don’t really have anything to sell, I’d just like to thank you for tuning in and checking Vekllei out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve drawn Tzipora here as a sort of Sailor Moon knock-off. Good show that. The Japanese intro is very nostalgic, I’d love to do a little animated short in that style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I post about twice a week. I do a bit of everything — machines, maps, characters, landscapes, architecture, etc. I’m truly a master of none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can come join the Discord if you’d like — it’s just a quiet community to share interests and talk: discord.gg/dCE6vSU&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, I’ll keep doing what I’m doing and you can keep liking my stuff (please). If you have any questions about the project, or just want to introduce yourselves, here’s a good place to do it!
Thank you kindly to all commenters, readers and friends of the project, whether you’ve been here for years or for six hours — it’s very special to have so many people interested in work that’s so close to my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep on keeping on,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hobart&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There were plumes in the sky&lt;/strong&gt;, sent from bunkers buried deep in the well of the Earth, killing with switches. Vekllei went to war, and so Tzipora went to war with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The throbbing machinery of another world began turning, and anyone who saw the bomb would hear it. Passing seconds dislocated and caught heartbeats. The plumes were pretty. It was such a shame, those plumes. It was a quiet afternoon in the flower-tundras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an absolute quiet among the grasses, and peace in her heart. She had work to do. She was a warden, after all — and she’d done a good job spotting the missile before the sirens caught up. In truth, any devastation seemed incomprehensible. The flower-tundra would last forever. But that was her job, and she had to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She left her bucket by the freshwater creek, intending to retrieve it a while later. The drinking water tasted better up here. She turned from the plume and followed the moss path out of the flower-tundra. Her village was before her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So ended the old ways and so started the new.&lt;/p&gt;

Broadly, Newda buildings emphasise distinction from the surrounding landscape (called Dumousiantopet, or ‘beautiful and seperate’), natural decay, and honesty in material and construction. Vekllei’s great Parliament House is Newda; as are the little rural homes found in the mountains inland in Vekllei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora’s house in the village of Montre-Lola (&lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/images/railmap.jpg&#34;&gt;as depicted on the map here&lt;/a&gt;) is built in what Vekllei calls “Azores revivalism”, a Newda style heavily influenced by the stripped deco and streamline moderne buildings of a century prior. It is part of a constant conversation Newda holds with its past, as both a deeply modernist, progressive school and one bound up in the wider aesthetic and cultural traditions of Upen, the spiritualism of Vekllei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her house is small, but appears larger due to the layout of the structure. A small sleeping loft sits atop the living, bathing and cooking areas of the home, and opens out into a private rooftop garden. The utilities tower also hides a small staircase leading to the roof, which is also accessible for outdoor recreation. Her home stands amidst the farmland of Montre-Lola, and very near the library and primary school where she works. Her property is marked at its end by a creek that runs into the Dentre River. She has a vegetable garden in her backyard, and shares her paddocks with her neighbours for grazing periodically throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her house was erected in gratitude by her neighbours out of prefab components, and assisted by a “construction line,” — a temporary rail line in which goods are delivered and cranes are supported, minimising the need for lorries. Houses of this type and period are rarely seen in agricultural settings in other countries, but in Vekllei, where Landscape has been abolished, there might as well be no difference between a building suitable for the cosmopolitan, coastal cities and a dwelling for a farmer-girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-thousand-year-old-girl&#34;&gt;The Thousand-Year-Old Girl&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📖 Published 12th August 2020 |&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/images/gregori.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;smallimg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The concept of living forever&lt;/strong&gt; jumps out at people uncomfortable with their own existence. There is a contemplative instinct among educated people that — if they could simply will themselves into a state of self-actualisation — death would only be an obstacle to greatness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Tzipora found out quickly, the opposite was true — death and temporality were wells of meaning against which all great people, beauty, and human constructions were cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora Desmoisnes is what is known as a Gregori Baby, a catch-all term for a unique genetic condition that has seemingly produced a variety of miracle children appropriate for the frothing futurism of the atomic age — boys and girls who, suspended in the purity and good-naturedness of childhood — live forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no single “Gregori Baby” — each is unique, and Tzipora is the 13th to have been recognised overall. The phrase is a shortening of Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome, a stand-in for medical information that isn’t there. The first, Gregori Hordiyenko, was born in 2024. He was healthy, and died of unrelated causes in his 20s. Tzipora, at 13th, continues to live to this day and is the oldest person on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a disturbing trend among the Gregori children, first heralded as miracles and symptoms of the space age, to deteriorate medically as more are born. The culprit is the malfunctioning of telomeres in their DNA — the source of their longevity — which regularly produce devastating chromosomal disorders, including Trisomy 13 &amp;amp; 18, killing most “ageless children” before their third birthday. Those that survive are often victims of a severe anaphylaxis caused by a hyperactive immune system — rendering many of them permanently sickly. Others find themselves unageing, but continue to grow — reaching as tall as 2.5m before their bodies give out from exhaustion and osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is Gregori syndrome? What does your average (healthy) Gregori baby look like? Their genetic miracle is linked to the structures of the body that activate at puberty, and so girls vary between 11-16 years of age at onset depending on many factors that affect their development. Boys tend to be a little younger, from 8-14. Between the two, girls tend to be more stable, and all but two of the supercentenarian Gregori children are female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among girls, they are prepubescent and generally stop ageing on the eve of menarche, or their first period. In Tzipora’s case, her body is estimated to be 13 years and 11 months old. Unlike many Gregori children, Tzipora lives in a wealthy country and has volunteered for extensive research into her genetic makeup, meaning that much of early medical documentation around Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome was received directly from her case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most obvious is that, at a foundational level, her cells are similar in function to unipotent stem cells, and have been since hormones at the end of thelarche suspended her ageing. This change has occurred somewhere in her DNA — exactly where is unknown — but the end result is that, unlike regular progenitor cells that make up most adult bodies, the building blocks of her body are capable of cell-renewal. Her telomeres, the endcaps of chromosomal DNA in mammals, are undamaged. And so there is an amazing shift in her basic human structure — in which human cell lineage, which usually ends in a mature cell incapable of division, is caught and rearranged. With this considered, it is no wonder that Gregori children suffer from such catastrophic chromosomal instability, and why healthy ageless babies are a rarity. Her body is not exactly a “body of stem cells,” but for their function in a healthy Gregori child, they might as well be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is that nothing about Tzipora is changing. She suffers from pains in her legs often — called growing pains, although they are not from growing — and her cells continue to replenish, albeit at a rate 1.25 times that of normal people. She is, in essence, “growing” as any other premenarchal girl would, but she is not getting bigger or becoming older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora is blessed with an adult life in Vekllei, where the “Child” does not exist as it does in the West, and her individual freedoms are far-ranging. She may smoke, and drink, and has held many different jobs in her life. She holds two doctorates in English and Vekllei Literature. She is obviously sterile — even if she were to somehow “age out” of prepubescence into pubescence and receive the required hormones, she simply lacks the genetic code to reproduce — but raises many children through her active participation in village life and her roles as Montre-Lola’s municipal and school librarian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other countries, with coded roles for children, their problems are much greater. Unable to form adult relationships and often incapable of finding work, many work in entertainment or fall into poverty as they outlive their friends and parents. Socially ostracised and forever young, many are victims of superstition and fear. As the pattern of Gregori children indicates an increase in mortality, even as more are born, their appearance is both a miracle and a tragedy — ageing not through mitosis but through weathering the societies in which they live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-31st-century--vekllei-throughout-our-solar-system&#34;&gt;The 31st Century — Vekllei throughout our Solar System&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📖 Published 9th August 2020 |&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/i6528h/the_31st_century_vekllei_throughout_our_solar/&#34;&gt;Read here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/images/apricot.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve spent a lot of time in the 21st century&lt;/strong&gt; — but Tzipora is biologically immortal. Where does she go from here? Well, let’s enjoy a small glimpse at that future together, by winding the clock forward one thousand years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 3076, our Solar System is a pleasant place to be. Most of the planets we once gazed at from afar are now habitable and lived on. The Great Epoch of Rest has begun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no great interstellar empire, no rise and fall of spacefaring supernations — a Vekllei way of life is now lived out in multicultural, prosperous clusters of people across our Solar System. The ordinary person is afforded incredible freedoms previously reserved for science fiction through the accessibility of personal light spacecraft, translated literally as “boats”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This here is the M-7000 APRICOT, manufactured by the Government Aerospace Factories (GAF) of Vekllei. Many companies are contracted by the GAF, including General Reactor S.A., to whom this boat lends most of its flight control systems and all of its power plant. It is a light, personal boat for women built in 2807, making it relatively unique in both its 28th century design language and its gendered marketing. While the personal boat market was growing rapidly by this time, the vast majority of owners and pilots were men. The APRICOT set out to change that, and Tzipora, the world’s oldest living person with a youthful face, was among the first to demonstrate the accessibility and freedoms of space travel for women and girls in the personal boat market. It was her first boat, and despite its orientation for women it was christened with a male name: BARON.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a comfortable and pleasant craft that can be lived in for extended periods of time. Tzipora has done just that, travelling to stars in search of water-planets with Micronesian archipelagos, where she likes to spend most of her time. Its glass roof across the entire accessible cabin, including bubbled cockpit, gives it breathtaking visibility in the depths of space and the most scenic of planets alike. Like almost all spacecraft, it is unarmed, save for the pacifying “jazz” electric canon, named for its firing sound reminiscent of a double bass strum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she tires of being alone, she returns to her hometown of Montre-Lola in Vekllei frequently. Boats are usually parked at off-world stations, preserving the aerospace and quiet of the Solar System.
Light speed is exceeded through superluminal travel. So-called black boxes require extraordinarily precise programming, since superluminal travel is in all ways but name time travel, and the universe does not tolerate time travel. Coordinates calculated in the universal pyramid system by a pyramid computer ensure that a vessel arrives when it arrives, so to speak. The alternative is going nowhere at all — there is no in-between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superluminal systems are affected by gravity, so any person looking to exceed the speed of light and subsequently visit other stars must take the highways beyond our home system’s planetary orbit and launch into so-called free-travel from there. There are only a handful of these highways — the solar system is very, very large, and human construction is very, very small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an instinct among many people that human progress would naturally scale exponentially — these were extrapolated from the remarkable progress in the lifetime of Tzipora’s parents and grandparents, who saw canvas aircraft in their childhood advance to the landing of a man on the moon, and again in her own exaggerated lifetime, in which the provinciality of her youth has simultaneously seen an expansion and exploitation of the planets in our native solar system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This curve of progress was not to be, however — and it also explains why we had such trouble meeting aliens in the first place. Part of it was simply that there are very few worlds with water that also formed earthlike landmasses nearby — there are many aliens, and Tzipora has seen many herself, but most of them are fish and fish-adjacent. The second is that, if there is civilised life out there, it has most probably encountered the same engineering truths that humanity did, in our great interstellar project of the last thousand years. Namely that, all accounted for, there is no use for wasteful megastructures when a small one will do. People are having less children — on Mars, Mercury and Neptune, the population is actually shrinking. What good is the so-called “ocean liner of the stars,” with a capacity of millions? There are around 12 billion people across the solar system today. Maybe another 8 billion in the Ala system. Maybe a few millions more who have simply given up society for scattered stars in our neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is likely that if any other civilised races exist, they are simply of our scale, or have destroyed themselves completely in the reckless pursuit of expansion. Humanity is lucky not to count themselves among them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The APRICOT is one of many models produced by Vekllei’s Government Aerospace Factories. It is now possible for the ordinary person to explore distant stars for themselves, granting freedoms unimaginable in a previous age. Such is life in the Great Epoch of Rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BY MILKY#0144&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All direct quotes are from Melon’s Reddit posts or saved from his previous website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about nature. Picture it in your mind. What do you see? Are there any buildings? Do you see your friends, or any people at all? What adjectives might you use to describe it? How do you interact with nature in your mind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a divide between human society and what is considered ‘nature’ – landscapes, national parks or forests, beaches, mountain trails, campgrounds&amp;hellip; Nature is often seen as a place you visit and a place you come home from. A temporary escape from societal woes. A vacation spot; perhaps someplace nostalgic. A special area, with boundaries and signs and info centers, that should be protected. It has also been seen as something owed to humans – wilderness to be tamed and dominated, or land to be cleared, excavated, drilled, and paved for capitalist human use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional environmental ethics heavily involves romantic, heroic, and nurturing narratives in regard to the relationship among humans, nonhuman animals, and this ‘nature.’ Empathy, care, and connection have been key in ecofeminist discourse on environmentalism and nonhuman animal rights. These values are traditionally feminine, and environmentalism is often seen as feminine as a result. Terms like treehugger exemplify the feminine care given by environmentalists. Another term, ‘soy boy,’ does not necessarily point to environmentalists, but ‘soy’ being a feminine quality implies alternatives to animal products being something only for women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parallel to environmentalism being a feminine work, nature is often coded as female. Mother Nature nurtures living beings, feeding plants and animals alike. Western romantic authors wrote comparisons between women and nature and were inspired by both alike. They are something beautiful to look at and something to find inspiration in. They are pure and untouched until man/humans tame and mold them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vekllei is a fundamentally female country. This is what petticoat society means.” This does not mean that the feminised, pure, idealised nature persists. Take our protagonist Tzipora for example. She is female, yet not an idealised maternal woman that could possibly be confused for a Mother Nature figure. She is an eternal child, neither pure or innocent, nor in need of care and protection. If we consider the following quote, however, we can see how Tzipora’s situation reflects or is reflected in Vekllei’s unique environmentalist situation: “Vekllei is not alienated from its landscape but exists very much within it. Vekllei people do not consider themselves different from nature &amp;ndash; they exist alongside everything else in the landscape. Their environment is not exploited, and so its protection is not necessitated through its abstraction and alienation, of which environmentalism is a symptom (as a reaction to exploitation).” Though Tzipora is very different from the rest of her community, she is not alienated from those around her. She is enmeshed in Vekllei’s culture and society and dutifully participates in school and work. She is inseparable from her environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, “Vekllei has abolished landscape, deconstructing its vicious abstractionism.” In Vekllei, nature is not seen as ‘other’ or as romantically female, and this binary of human/nature has been removed. Of course, it is impossible to abolish landscape and our artist would not paint and describe such rich landscapes if they no longer existed. Paintings of Vekllei often depict Zelda and co., concrete buildings, and railways contrasted with the country’s rolling hills, grassy plains, and volcanic rock. The combination of humans and both their built and ‘natural’ environs is what makes up the Vekllei landscape, as there is no separation in Vekllei between nature and society. Everything in each painting is the natural landscape of Vekllei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what has been abolished is the idea that nature is another place, something separate than the culture of Vekllei. In the 2020 Vekllei Handbook, MelonKony writes: “We are not a particularly environmentalist bunch, since we&amp;rsquo;re not alienated from our land, and we’re certainly not sentimental, but we do understand the relationship our lives have with our surrounds, and the utility and protection of nature is important to us as a lifestyle and a spiritual tenant of Upen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the respectful utility and protection of nature is important, wouldn’t such a way of living with nature, being human as part of the natural world, lead to environmentalism? Not necessarily. “Nature is a fellow social organ, like society or family, and so Vekllei is not ‘environmentalist’ in the Western idea of the word but instead makes use of and protects its natural environment for the benefit of both themselves and the land.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think now about what surrounds you. The air, your room, your home, your town, and beyond. When you think about what is important to you about the natural world, imagine what your Ghibli/Tintin landscape would look like. Don’t forget to include the buildings and people in your orbit. There is no real boundary between you and the community you live and work in and the larger “natural world.” It is all part of the natural world. No need to call yourself particularly environmentalist even if you care about the world around you. You are still just as enmeshed with nature as our Vekllei friends are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-the-editor&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the Editor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the fifth issue of The &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;. I hope you like stories — because this month was all about little snippets of life in Vekllei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a correlation between how nice a picture looks and how short the accompanying story is. Recently, as I’ve finished paintings later and later into the early morning, the posts that follow show signs of my fatigue. It’s to my detriment — and with a bit of planning, easily avoided. In October I’ll be looking at making some long-form posts in a painterly style to experiment with the format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appropriate for such a quiet month, no one got their contributions in on time! This makes a nice short bulletin. As a reminder, if you would like to contribute to The Atlantic with writing, art or reviews relevant to the spirit of petticoat ideology, please contact Hobart at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:melonkony@icloud.com&#34;&gt;melonkony@icloud.com&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;strong&gt;31st of October&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for supporting Vekllei, and best wishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hobart Phillips
&lt;strong&gt;Enjoy — 楽しんで&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Huge advancements on the website, which will likely launch sometime this month. Watch this space! If you’ve missed previous bulletins, they’ll be available in full on the site along with a comprehensive wiki and post archive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wiki supports live switching between multiple languages — if you’re bilingual (or for that matter, trilingual!) and have some interest in translating a few pages, let me know!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiet month on the subreddit, but managed to work on a little animation that turned out quite nice! See below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My thesis is due on the 23rd of October — this means that content will pick up for the remainder of the year. I plan to launch the comic in November.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That’s all. Quiet month — not a bad thing in the slightest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-tzipora-watch&#34;&gt;II. Tzipora-watch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September of 2073, Tzipora began work at the Lola District Library at the age of 26, a move that would develop within her a love of librarianship that would see her enrol in Montre-Lola University to study literature two years later. Her time at Lola was spent managing loans and navigating visitors through the vast archives beneath by way of a light monorail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upen designates a hierarchy in the human body as part of ritualistic processions. The heart, depicted as a crown, is considered the most sacred. The brain and hands are next, and the rest of the body is catalogued and ordered ending with the feet. Feet are considered unclean in Vekllei and is part of the reason why shoes are not worn indoors. This hierarchy, called &lt;em&gt;Lohsmi&lt;/em&gt;, is a minor cultural force but is important in the physical formation of runes, or &lt;em&gt;Upotenne&lt;/em&gt; (spirit-hand-talk).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iv-wordbook&#34;&gt;IV. WordBook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spiousn&lt;/strong&gt; — difficult to translate, &lt;em&gt;spiousn&lt;/em&gt; describes the feeling of regaining energy after a long period of exhaustion. It can be applied to a sick person becoming well, or more contemporaneously to a student after the exam period. This word forms a component of the slang spiousnya, which refers to the break from school at the end of the year. In this sense, its meaning translates to “school break” but carries with it a sentiment of peace and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;baron-the-father&#34;&gt;Baron, the Father&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📖 Published 30th September 2020 |&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/j23lyw/baron_the_father/&#34;&gt;Read here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/images/father.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;smallimg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People are not sure what to make of Baron&lt;/strong&gt;. They are not sure what to make of his daughter, Tzipora, either. To that end, they are lucky to have found each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His obscurity is part of a severe disposition, made obvious by his astonishing disinterest in friends and hobbies. When he finishes work, he listens to the radio, prepares supper, and goes to bed. His unrelenting seriousness is mitigated by his general passivity — Baron is a man totally in control, who keeps to himself and does not take issue with what goes on around him. For his seriousness he is not particularly judgemental or opinionated. To call him boring would be a poor characterisation; he simply feels he has done enough and is not looking to complicate the basic equations of his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora (Zelda to him) complicates this equation. She’s similar to him in many ways, with her conservative personal disposition and humble lifestyle. She does not make a very good teen-ager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s funny you say that. I was talking to her the other day, and she was talking about how nice it was to have some peace and quiet,” Baron once confided in Ayn. “Of course, she looks very young, so sometimes you have to remind yourself that she’s not a child. She’s not thirteen, she’s nineteen, and very unusual, I think. She’s very smart but she doesn’t let that on much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora did not really have “phases” — Tzipora was Tzipora, eternal. But she was a much more emotionally attuned person, and her highs were higher and her lowers were lower than anything Baron had felt in decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was not always so unfeeling. Baron’s Ashkenazim parents were pulled straight from the bubbling diaspora of Eastern Europe. They met in the labour zionist movement, but fell out of love with professional organising and immigrated to a struggling Vekllei to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/g4wo2w/the_ou_hydroburo_office/&#34;&gt;work in the national hydroelectricity scheme&lt;/a&gt;, among thousands of immigrants employed by the Thunderburo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was born in 2027 and was not very interested in school as a child. He was rebellious and obstinate, and had only vague ambitions of acquiring a trade certificate in motorcycle repair. His sister, Amelie, died of tuberculosis when he was 11. That was about the end of school ambitions for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He started conscription early and spent his high school years in an army college. By the time he was 18, he was transferred to military police. It was 2045. He had started dating a middle school sweetheart, Ayn, two weeks before the war in Taiwan broke out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young Baron died in Taiwan, and another figure in his body returned. He was transferred almost immediately to a junior post at the Americas Bureau at National Intelligence (AB/NI), where he would spend the next decade. While he was stationed abroad, his mother died and his father followed. By this time, Baron was a significant asset for Vekllei’s deep autonomous intelligence work — apolitical, unattached, unsentimental and steady on his feet. He was destined to die in Colombia, employed indefinitely and waiting to be used up. In 2063, he met a fellow Spanish-speaking Jew by name of Tzipora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, his identity is as fractured as Tzipora’s, whose Jewish European ancestry was a novel curiosity and not much more. She considered herself a Latina-American until she was Vekllei, and since then she has not been anything more. That was how it went in Vekllei’s grand secular melting pot. Tzipora was still ta bubeleh to him, but by his mid-thirties Baron had lost most of his mother’s Yiddish.
Tzipora is his closest friend and daughter at the same time. She is a wholly energetic and independent agent in his life, and their relationship alternates awkwardly but intuitively between father-daughter and old friends. Ayn wonders if it is not a coincidence that Tzipora looks like Amelie, his sister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two of them champion the redemption of losers; the adrift, empty people of the world, acting on a chance to salvage a life and family. Tzipora expected to die in America; Baron expected nothing at all. But when Christmas comes around, and Ayn visits for supper, Taiwan and America melt into air; and their apartment houses the only Jewish Christmas tree in the neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a week since I&amp;rsquo;ve posted&lt;/strong&gt;. Most of that was spent drawing the same thing over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A painting? Please. That&amp;rsquo;s a day&amp;rsquo;s work — maybe two. A five second loop of Tzipora jumping in and shuffling over? A week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to grasp just how much work animation is until you try it. This runs at 12 frames per second (which dickheads will recognise as the anime frame rate). There are maybe 38 unique frames in this tiny animation. It&amp;rsquo;s a title card for my imaginary studio, MillMint, in case I ever make videos in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sketch was fun. It comes alive — your precious characters become real. Then comes the inking. 38 lines traced and polished. Then comes the colouring. Good lord, the colouring. It isn&amp;rsquo;t just labour-intensive &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s mind-numbingly boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This animation has a lot of little imperfections. No, I&amp;rsquo;m not fixing them :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular post tomorrow to make up for a week of empty suffering. Thanks for looking. Let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;memory-and-death-in-the-flower-tundra&#34;&gt;Memory and Death in the Flower Tundra&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📖 Published 19th September 2020 |&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/ivfcj4/memory_and_death_in_the_flower_tundra/&#34;&gt;Read here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was their first hike after Maya’s funeral&lt;/strong&gt;. She had found adult life completely disappointing, and never moved out of home. In her last summer, she developed a desperate fascination with her receding childhood, and eventually took her own life outside of the classroom she’d studied in as a third-grade student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her death deeply disturbed Tzipora, who was keenly aware of how sentimental people died against metrics of their own imagination. She wondered if the government architects who designed schools and universities considered how those spaces gave life to memories. They were filled with lunchtimes and puppy love and old friends and your parents — and those things folded into brick and concrete and linoleum floors. Fifty years earlier, some architect designed a classroom so valuable that Maya took her own life in the memory of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their Puffling troop had set off for a camp site two hours away. Tzipora and Zo did not walk with them. They followed the flower tundra north, near where Zo and Maya had played as kids. At the base of an old oak, shrouded in a cool mist, Zo buried a pair of plastic earrings and laced school shoes, neither of which had been worn in a long time. Zo started to cry. Tzipora gave her some time to herself. After a while they drank hot tea with their feet in the creek. The mist had closed them in. There was good reason why people travelled to flower-tundras to meet with the dead. The mirror-pools and tombstone drumlins invoked the spirits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the tea, Zo pulled out her map and they set off again for the camp site, leaving the tree behind forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another paint-sketch — a painting done fast. I’m trying to learn to a) paint and b) paint on an industrial scale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She’d missed the fast tram&lt;/strong&gt;, caught a tiny splinter in her thumb, lost a button and now the match wouldn’t strike. It just wasn’t her day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were in Callaisn (pronounced ka-lane), a borough of the capital Tzipora regarded as “the worst of them” for its tall buildings and labyrinthian concrete alleys. “Bad people, bad food, bad smells” she said, flashing the tact she was known for. “Let’s go home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Callaisn was an oddity, built largely by the British during the occupation years in the fashion of London. It was nonetheless a thoroughly Vekllei borough, with its parks and tramways and rivulets, but it had a continental skyline marked by tower blocks and skyscrapers. A lot of boring business was done in Callaisn that Tzipora didn’t care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cobian frowned as Tzipora rotated a second match between her thumb and finger. She didn’t like this nasty little habit she’d picked up. “You’ll smell like your dad if you keep this up,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Suits me,” said Tzipora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;road-trip&#34;&gt;Road Trip&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📖 Published 11th September 2020 |&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They showed up at the autopool&lt;/strong&gt;, and someone had just returned a brand new AAAC Voya Voya — incredible. It was like Christ himself had blessed them. It only (barely) seat five, and there were six of them, but it wasn’t a problem. Moise would drive, Tzipora bunked with Cobian in the passenger seat and Alise, Zo and Jerome could cram into the back. It was a squeeze but with the top down and on the coastal highway it couldn’t have mattered less. It was the car of late summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zo had just married Jerome, and they had recently moved in with each other at age 17. Tzipora had no metrics to figure out if that was too young, but Zo was her friend and young newlyweds were lonely people. She was all too ready to volunteer her labour (and that of Cobian and Moise) to drive them down to Koisniya and pick them up a coffee machine she’d ordered six months prior. Tohs S.p.A. was a good company but Tohs himself was a disorganised bastard and he’d rung up to a few times to tell her the order had been delayed. Then she called him back a month later and he said he’d never received the order. So it was that they were on their way now, well after Zo and Jerome had married, to pick up the wedding gift. That was just how things worked in Vekllei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zo’s friend Alise sat the coffee machine in her lap on the way back, and as the coastal highway reached Vik it skirted an incredible series of cliffs that they stopped to look at. The wind was out and the Atlantic churned beneath. The sun was hot on their skin. The coffee machine was left on the tiny back seat as they got out to have a look and take a picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;clean-faces-full-hearts-uniforms-in-vekllei-892020&#34;&gt;Clean Faces; Full Hearts: Uniforms in Vekllei [8.9.2020]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📖 Published 8th September 2020 |&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/iocwxt/clean_faces_full_hearts_uniforms_in_vekllei/&#34;&gt;Read here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/images/uniform.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;smallimg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Vekllei, uniforms are prevalent across all levels of society&lt;/strong&gt;. They are perhaps the most obvious example of the opaque contradictions at the heart of Vekllei life, caught between wholly opposing ideas: between tradition and progress; liberty and control; and, most crucially here — between individualism and the burden of society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depicted here are uniforms for education — Tzipora as a puffling of the Puffin Scouts on the left, and the others in mere school uniforms. These uniforms are universal and used across all ages of schooling, from kindergarten to university. Even some teachers wear them — it starts to stretch the conventional imagination about what constitutes a uniform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few observations on this picture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, these uniforms are used interchangeably across ages and disciplines. The difference between a red pleat skirt and a navy skirt is trivial; it is merely a difference in the meaning of the clothing, as part of Vekllei semaphore. They are both equally the school-mandated uniform of education, and can be worn interchangeably from one day to the next, in third grade and at university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, there are many small uniquenesses in the uniform of each person, which are accentuated by their surrounding uniformity. Tzipora’s school shirt is pleated along the buttons, acquired off the rack of a department store. One pair of trousers might be a slightly different shade to the pair next to it. These discrepancies are not regarded as malfunctions of the uniform system, since the system is not designed to make each student conform to a single appearance — it is about identity and convenience in a country that spent many decades clawing its way out of abject poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These principles apply across many workplaces and in government, too — where uniforms are not intended to only signify publicly a place of work but instead form social bonds through clothing, which are intimate factors of ordinary life. In Vekllei, clothes are not an expression of personality, but items to communicate and bond with, regulated not by an authority demanding strict conformity but a desire for identity, physicality, infrastructure and convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a state of affairs is unimaginable in some countries, especially beyond collectivist or conformist cultures. Individualist intuition suggests that uniforms are actively detrimental to personal expression — but this idea demands a scale of expression far beyond the preference for subtlety and delicateness in Upen. Deviations from uniformity, like earrings, the way hair is worn, wristwatches, makeup and minor irregularities accentuate the value of those things, and make them more important. This aesthetic contrast is at the heart of the wider Upen intuition that you can see in architecture and political priority alike. And, as any Vekllei boy will tell you — seeing a classroom crush out of uniform for the first time is a religious experience, and only afforded by scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei is an individualist society, modelled after self-concern and self-love by a salt-of-the-earth and larrikin people of my native Australia. This is not a people compatible with conventional thinking on the regulation of appearance — but, as with many things in Vekllei, both are held true at the same time. They are a free and unrestrained population clothed at work and in school in clothes gifted to them.
As an addendum, although many readers find common ancestry with Japan in this project (not unreasonably, either), Vekllei has more in common in some ways with the distant neighbours of my Australian homeland — countries that haven’t been glamorised in the West through culture export. Thailand, Cambodia and Laos are among them — coincidentally, all three are rare examples of countries where university students wear uniforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someday, we’ll look at the aesthetics of power and authority-worship, inspired at least in part by the history and culture of these countries, and associate them with cultural forces in Vekllei. If you have any questions, just ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-the-editor&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the Editor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the sixth issue of The &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;. Big announcements, short bulletin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve started work on &lt;em&gt;Atomic Modern&lt;/em&gt;, better known as ’the Vekllei comic.’ I’m about five pages in so far. I have a distinct style of illustration, but that doesn’t always translate well to a panel format, and navigating that fact has been a real challenge. Generally, pages are just taking too long — about half a page a day so far. How on earth do some authors produce 500-page tomes? I’m working on fixing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrons will see pages this week! How exciting. I’ll also be in close contact with patrons regarding the upcoming $100/month milestone, and how best to celebrate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this month was dominated by conversation about the comic, we also saw a mix of posts this month of various types and styles. In future, while balancing regular comic production, I’ll be looking at trimming traditional posts down to about once a week (as in this month) and putting efforts into finishing the website and polishing posts on the subreddit. I want to reign things in a bit — explore different samples of Vekllei life playfully and efficiently, and dispense for a moment the traditional story posts, which will be supplemented by the linear story of the comic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you would like to contribute to The &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; with writing, art or reviews relevant to the spirit of petticoat ideology, please contact Hobart at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:melonkony@icloud.com&#34;&gt;melonkony@icloud.com&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;strong&gt;30th of November&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for supporting Vekllei, and best wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Enjoy — 楽しんで&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My honours thesis is done. Hip hip hooray. At some point in future, once it’s marked and returned, it’ll be archived on the site alongside other essays I’ve worked on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The site is not done! I’ll be looking to finish the main articles this month, and contributing regularly to expand the content of the site. I’d rather have fewer, high-quality articles than many stub or low-quality articles. I’ll also be looking for volunteers to help translate the main page and perhaps a key article for newcomers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Atlantic Bulletin will be archived on the site, so if you’ve missed editions you’ll be able to read them there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first few pages of the comic will arrive for free on the subreddit sometime this month.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October of 2064, Tzipora would begin work as a junior commis chef at a local Spanish restaurant, training under immigrant head chef (and proud Spaniard) Valentino “Val” Martinez. Tzipora could scarcely speak Vekllei and was berated incessantly by Martinez, who saw her has slow-witted and untalented. In time, however, Tzipora would prove her culinary ability and made good use of her talents at home, preparing simple, fresh cooking in a new country that celebrates local food. She would rise to the rank of sous chef, and enjoyed her work there until she left to finish high school the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii-vekllei-fact-of-the-month&#34;&gt;III. Vekllei Fact of the Month&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unusually for a country often regarded as European, Vekllei has little popular conception of the Second World War. Although a member of the Axis powers from 1936 thru 1941, Vekllei’s small navy was entirely sunk within months of the war’s opening by British naval dominance in the North Atlantic, and by 1942 was press-ganged as a staging point for American aircraft. Vekllei students only spend a few weeks learning about WW2 in mandatory history classes, and it rarely appears in popular culture, a cultural artefact attributed to the general distaste for Junta-era history and the minor role the country played in the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sukish&lt;/strong&gt; — pronounced “sookie,” &lt;em&gt;Sukish&lt;/em&gt; describes the sensation of warm sunlight on bare skin. Derived from the &lt;em&gt;Loh&lt;/em&gt; glossary, it is gentle and playful despite Loh’s association with moonlight and winter, and is often used poetically in advertisements and ceremonial speech to suggest new beginnings and rebirth. Pictographically, is is depicted as a sun on a crown. Spend too long in the sun, however, and you might suffer &lt;em&gt;Acelouliah&lt;/em&gt;, which is the literal word for burning, and is used equally to describe sunburn and burning food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He not busy being born is busy dying,&amp;rdquo; — that’s off a Bob Dylan bootleg. I’ve just finished my thesis and I’m busy being born again. Sometimes I feel like I’m busy dying. Drawing’s been the way out for a long time now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today I’m starting work full-time on a Vekllei comic called Atomic Modern. The front cover looks like a textbook. The name is not that interesting. That’s okay — apparently my honours in media didn’t do anything for my marketing ability, but this project is about celebrating mundanity and restraint. Tzipora’s got a fag in her mouth but it isn’t lit. I feel like that a lot of the time. It’s a self-contained image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomic Modern is about Tzipora and Vekllei. It’s about her friends and her memories and all the good and bad parts of her life. It’s about what went down in America and how you can justify living. It’ll have beautiful Vekllei landscapes and characters in muted colour. It will also include passages that act as a guide to Vekllei and society — diagrams, infographics and footnotes. It’s also an escape from everything going on right now — there’s good and bad in all stories, but at the end of the day Vekllei is a utopia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I will publish pages here for free&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.patreon.com/vekllei&#34;&gt;I’ll collate them into chapters available exclusively to my patrons&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe some extra stuff too. I’m a good dad to my patrons. I already made a set of postcards and sent them out. Either way, you’ll continue to see stuff here.
This is exciting, isn’t it? This is a new chapter for me as an artist. It’s a vulnerable moment for me, because up until now it’s just sort of been “posting on reddit”. I don’t have a publisher, I’m not trained, I’m just some guy. But this is what I’ve always wanted to do, and I’m trying to get busy being born again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There should be regular world posts here still. There’s drawings I like to do that just don’t fit into a comic format. I think during weekdays I’ll work on the comic and on weekends I’ll do a painting. We’ll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I’ll have a nice big wiki soon with multiple language support. I’ll let you know when it’s done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start this again, with all that off my chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, I’m Hobart. I’m busy getting born again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much love,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My nerves are like overused sandpaper—all dull; only the eye-catching, bizarre and grotesque can excite me now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tanizaki Junichirō, 1918&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The wind had died and it seemed that she would follow it&lt;/strong&gt;. Crazy shadows distorted beneath car headlights. It occurred to her in some way that, as she approached dying, she was living out the ultimate dramatic fantasy of the American misplaced girl, in the same way the townsmen were fulfilling their grotesque constellation of death by murdering women. To them, she was not Zelda, or an agitator, or even a maid from Motel Grande; she was just a girl of girl-form, washed out; beat in; bent before the death-bridge where the creek rolled on below. It was brutal and violent, and also the most tacky thing. It scaled up and down, because it was murdering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hearts of America are like overused sandpaper — all dull. This is how it played out in 2063, ages into the Great American Decline and well before it was put down like a sick dog by Chinese methods. The worn out bodies of the hedonistic coasts were numb to the spectacle of collapse and found themselves displaced and unfeeling, and so the neurotic motions of vampiric culture barons responded. In 2036, long before the Dallas Secession or Zelda’s birthday, the NBC under the Radio Corporation of America broadcast the first televised execution in the United States of child serial killer Wayne Graham. This enticed similar coverage across all major television networks for subsequent executions, which were viewed by millions of Americans. The format culminated in NBC’s The &lt;em&gt;American Justice Show&lt;/em&gt; programme, in which the method and subject of broadcasted executions were made participatory by public poll. It was tremendously successful but was cancelled in 2041, after the botched death of George Kovacs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not necrotic; this is neurotic; it is the ultimate sucking up of human desire into the commodity-form, and it was only the beginning. It is not just a poetic coincidence that the cancellation of &lt;em&gt;American Justice&lt;/em&gt; saw the legalisation (or at the very least, decriminalisation) of prostitution in all regions but the Deep South over the next decade (which would contribute to the eventual secession). This is pleasure in its raw form, and the murder of prostituted immigrant-labourers and the eroticisation of the death of Wayne Graham’s teen-age victims was one and the same. The necroticisation would arrive later, as modernity tumoured and pleasure outpaced the sovereignty of the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here was Zelda, who was a perfect caricature of the real American in the 21st century — born overseas, poor as shit, and dressed up for dying. And why shouldn’t she die? All the old things were dead. God, kings, outrage, empathy, optimism — it was all thrown in the creek, with the rest of the immigrant-labourers. Why shouldn’t a child and her sensitivity be among them? You could change the channel on television and see pornography and the brutal violence of the Secession adjacent to each other. If you clicked the knob back and forth fast enough, they could become one and the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora was the last to arrive and among the first to be lynched, and maybe they would make postcards out of her dead body. She couldn’t even wonder this in her terror; the thought would only occur to her much later. It seemed like the whole Great American Decline, in all its hungry decomposition and hedonism was leading to this single moment — and all that was once solid melts into Zelda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;petrol-heaven-the-rohsm-str-750&#34;&gt;Petrol Heaven: The Rohsm STR-750&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📖 Published 13th October 2020 |&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/j9up8s/petrol_heaven_the_rohsm_str750/&#34;&gt;Read here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/images/auto.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bulletin&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rohsm STR series&lt;/strong&gt; is a small racer built for clubs by Rohsm S.p.M., a hundred-year-old company headquartered in the Mediterranean racing culture of Tohs. Its most recent variant, the 750, is available in limited quantities to enthusiast owners and club pools. Like most petrol cars in Vekllei, they are built by hand, so no two 750s drive exactly alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to its neighbouring continents, petrol cars are criminally unsafe in Vekllei, where a preference for speed and lightweight manoeuvrability in European bodies see much of the steel of electric autos traded for light alloys and carbon. They crumple like drink cans in a crash, but prior to their death the driver is having the best driving experience of his life. This reckless pursuit of good driving means locals call them “bastard cars”. Extraordinarily lightweight and tremendously powerful, they cut sharp racing lines and trace corners. Poised and nimble, they make good use of Motorway One, the gentle curved ring road of Vekllei with no speed limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the inconvenience of finding petrol stations and their relative danger, not many people drive petrol cars in Vekllei. Why would you, when it is usually faster and more convenient to take a fast tram or train, or a battery auto from an autopool? The ones that do drive, however, drive hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pictured is the 25th STR-750, returned home after wins on the circuit in Italy and Spain. Her drivers are pictured above. It also happens to be Tzipora’s favourite car, because it was the first petrol car she ever drove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei’s obvious contradictions are commonly referenced, but not always clear&lt;/strong&gt;. Why are parts of Vekllei epistemology, or the ‘Vekllei way of thinking,’ contradictory? And if these are contradictions, then surely they must fall apart when they’re examined? How is it possible to hold two contradictory ideas at the same time and apply them? Let’s look at Product Atheism, Vekllei’s foundation for necroeconomics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Atismoprodarte&lt;/em&gt;, lit. “product atheism,” is the process by which Vekllei culture breaks down and rebuilds social preconceptions of objects, including products. Vekllei does not really have &lt;strong&gt;commodities&lt;/strong&gt; in the traditional idea of the word, so it is supplemented here by ‘&lt;strong&gt;product&lt;/strong&gt;,’ which more closely resembles the Vekllei word for commodity-forms: &lt;em&gt;prodart&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;prodatte&lt;/em&gt;. This concept is a part of &lt;em&gt;Upen&lt;/em&gt;, which is found throughout Vekllei culture and its constitution, and coexists agnostically with organised religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Product Atheism” is the term for how Vekllei people think about the objects that make up their lives — clothes, appliances, toys, trinkets and treasures. These things are not quite commodities, because they are not “sold”. Vekllei does not use money, and so it does not produce items of any economic value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An object’s economic form, then, is replaced by social form. Among Marxists, they call these social forms &lt;em&gt;fetishistic&lt;/em&gt;, because products are given lives of their own and exist independently of the labour that created them. But this doesn’t work in Vekllei, because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Labour-value is social, not economic&lt;/strong&gt;. Vekllei people are not paid for work and they do not pay money for products. All work is for social reasons; all consumption is for social needs. Any object that is prohibited from the ordinary Vekllei person is merely landscape; it has no form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Labour-value is simultaneously suppressed, in imitation of commodity, and celebrated, in imitation of dereification&lt;/strong&gt;. Vekllei shops look like any foreign shops, because they participate in the same fantasy ritual of shopping and allow easy access to products. At the same time, Upen emphasises the importance of local consumption and objects made by hand, and so Vekllei appliances are generally hand-made. This creates a social bond between the producer and consumer, and breaks down commodity-form, but it can’t escape the fetishised valuations encouraged by the consumer-fantasy. So it is neither a social or economic product while being both; resulting in a permanent contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Vekllei ‘Product Atheism’ is more or less a rejection of Marxist commodity fetishism, and instead advocates product-worship. This is because objects in Vekllei are regarded as fantasy, and are eroticised by a fantasy market. This is a symptom of the unspoken truth most foreigners are well aware of — Vekllei does not have an economy; &lt;strong&gt;the Vekllei economy is dead; the economy has been reanimated and is zombified&lt;/strong&gt;. No money changes hands, no product has value, and all products are abstracted and exclusively physical simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus Product Atheism has two contradictions; first, that the participatory market economy of Vekllei is both alive and dead, making it both undead and unaliave, and second, that products are both abstracted by Product Atheism and then unabstracted through Product Atheism at the same time, leaving them formless and unconstructed — and, per Upen’s definitions, truly personal and intimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging this necroeconomic construction destroys it, and so a final truth is revealed. In Vekllei, the exchange of objects is a &lt;strong&gt;social formality&lt;/strong&gt;, like their uniforms and sign-language, and is both entirely superfluous and essential to the functioning of the state. This is not Marxism; this is not even economic; this is Vekllei, and its cultural forms are what determine all constructions of society. Vekllei’s ‘material form’ is actually cultural, and Upen is its culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Vekllei economic forms are not truly economic, it makes sense that Product Atheism does not merely apply to the economy. All products, or objects, are part of its frameworks. The example used in this picture, depicting women’s fashion, is a good example of how Upen brings together an abstract object value and a valueless physical object simultaneously. Clothes in Vekllei have a very powerful social function, enhanced by how colour and shape become forms of communication in themselves as part of Vekllei semaphore. Clothes are both figuratively and literally signifiers of personality and individual expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vekllei written script, called &lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt;, most traditional clothing items are each assigned a single character, giving them a transcendental pictographic quality, a feature impossible to replicate in phonetic speech. In this sense, the written description of a dress in Vekllei supersedes its spoken equivalent, privileging pictorial, transcendental imagery over literalism. This poetic form is part of product-worship, and thus part of Product Atheism. This means that, without even touching the sociological tastes and trends of clothing fashion in Vekllei, we can see Product Atheism smashing Western frameworks against their own assumptions, leaving much of Vekllei epistemology, even today, incomprehensible to ideology without &lt;em&gt;Upen&lt;/em&gt; as its framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For a brief period of time&lt;/strong&gt;, Zelda and Cobian took it upon themselves to make something of their youth. Cobian fancied herself a gymnast, and though this ambition arrived too late and left too soon, she was quite good at it for a while. Tzipora was better suited on the trampoline, where her stiff leg didn’t give her as much trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They trained for about two hours, and after practice they met up to travel home together. Their gymnasium was in a coastal town called Gigayeh, in the borough of Mirah. Here, sloping lava fields were cast in the sea, buried under fine black sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an hour and a half after practice before the evening train arrived to take them back home to Lola, and so they were left with not much to do. Gigayeh had beautiful empty beaches, littered with icebergs that caught the light like jewels, but Tzipora couldn’t swim and the water was freezing. They could have enjoyed café food in the sun, but Cobian’s regimented home life had left her incapable of eating outside of her designated meals, and Tzipora could only drink so much coffee. Instead, most of these afternoons, they found themselves sitting on the ocean promenade, watching a handful of locals go about their business as they counted the minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the moment, it was stupefyingly boring. They’d spent all day at school with each other and usually couldn’t conjure a word between them. Tzipora would make a remark about a seabird, because she liked them. She had been learning a lot about birds. Sometimes they would share a comic, but they read too fast to fill time. Most of it was spent in the sea air, feeling it grow colder as the day waned, watching the same ocean foam throw itself onto glittering volcanic sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think that’s a horned puffin. That’s special,” Tzipora said out loud. Cobian didn’t even look up. Tzipora squinted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, wait, that’s just a regular one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In time, Tzipora would remember this period of her life fondly, and would visit Gigayeh to recapture that peace. As a teen-ager, however, those afternoons seemed to last forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the sixth issue of The &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;. November’s a bitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a hard month, evidenced in part by the smaller number of posts. Personal problems and some bad news are enough to derail plans, I’m afraid, and so other things had to take their place. November saw an increase in articles on MillMint.net and polish to the site, a whole lot of little sketches, as well as plans for a Patreon milestone reward and some private work on the comic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comic’s coming, by the way. I know it’s a little late and a little quiet, but it’s hard yakka and I’m doing my best. I’m writing this in early December, and I can tell you already that the winds are changing — and man do I have a great month of stuff planned, including comic drafts and pins for Patrons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;November saw two big “article-type” posts about language and city planning — sister articles on religion and nature will arrive in December. These posts help form the full-length wiki articles on the website, which will be comprehensive resources for understanding Vekllei. How exciting! Also expect a few more snapshots of life before the comic pages are released to Patrons in the coming weeks. As always, thanks for your patience, dear reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you would like to contribute to The &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; with writing, art or reviews relevant to the spirit of petticoat ideology, please contact Hobart at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:melonkony@icloud.com&#34;&gt;melonkony@icloud.com&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;strong&gt;30th of November&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for supporting Vekllei, and best wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Enjoy — 楽しんで&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Life can be hard sometimes. But it can also get better!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m planning a full, complete site launch in the new year! It’ll be a great wiki and archive of all content related to the project, and will really benefit my work overall. The comic will also be hosted via the site, though I’m still figuring out the particulars on that one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In November, I was interviewed by &lt;em&gt;Media Tackle&lt;/em&gt; about Vekllei and utopian worldbuilding, and I look forward to sharing that interview with you all soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My work on utopian worldbuilding in the films of Studio Ghibli will soon be hosted in the Essays section of the website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I love you.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November of 2075, Tzipora would begin work as an amateur contributor to the underground ‘zine Kid Comix, a satirical and often crude publication circulated mostly among its contributors and die-hard comix fans. This would get her in trouble more than once, especially after members of the Montre University faculty discovered her caricatures of them, but she would always look back on her time with the ‘zine fondly. In many ways, it introduced her to publishing and would lead to her employ at the Montre University Tribune, where she would eventually serve as Editor-in-Chief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All fishing trawlers in Vekllei — that is to say, fishing vessels above a certain size for large-scale commercial trawling — are owned and operated by the navy. The seas in Vekllei’s exclusive economic zone are mostly fished by small craft laying lines and nets, but the deeper peripheral waters that surround the zone are as contentious as they are well-stocked with fish. To ensure the security of their trawlers and preserve access to these valuable and contested waters, trawlers are often guarded by navy ships — a handful of trawlers are even equipped with guns!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gouisvenpan&lt;/strong&gt; — pronounced “gwee-ven-pan,” &lt;em&gt;Gouisvenpan&lt;/em&gt; describes a state or territory that is divided between two political powers as a result of treaty or civil war. Tzipora’s middle-school-era homeland, the United States, is currently suffering from &lt;em&gt;Gouisvenpan&lt;/em&gt; across many of its seceding states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She would spend a long time by the rivulet that ran behind her apartment.&lt;/strong&gt; She would do the housework and hang the wash out, then watch the water trickle past in the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She tried to open a jar the other day and started to cry when she couldn’t get it open. She never cried once when she saw those things in America, or got beat to shit, but these days she cried over jam. She didn’t know what was going on. Things were getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She caught her reflection in the rivulet’s water. It provoked a nausea. She was so tired. What would stop her from plunging her face into the river until she slipped right in? Would she drown and float away, never to be seen again? Or maybe, in a miracle, she might grow gills and fins and swim away, her life-force put to better use as a fish or turtle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you resolve an ache to confess sadness to someone and the instinct to protect your emotions? It wasn’t in her nature to tell people about her feelings. On some level, she looked down on it; every cell of her body told her to suffer in silence. She wore the same clothes every day. Why did she wear the same clothes every day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a fierce thing to discover within yourself that which you despise the most. She watched the foam gather around a stick wedged in the bank of the rivulet. If she’d been born elsewhere, into power and wealth rather than girlishness and poverty, she would have made an excellent thug. She wondered how much management she needed. Why was it so hard to live?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She tasted the water from the rivulet and it was cold and sweet, and said a prayer to the rivulet for its purity no matter what happened to her. The wash was dry on the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/images/city.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;smallimg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NO REALTORS EXCEPT THE STATE ■ THE COUNTY THE AGENT OF THE STATE ■ THE ARCHITECT THE AGENT OF THE COUNTY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is clear that in Vekllei democracy is a way of living more than it is a form of government&lt;/strong&gt;. After all, by metrics of representation, the Atlantic nation&amp;rsquo;s electoral system often sputters and fails, undermined by the bundling of the human and natural votes as equal, and the wildly disproportionate borough system. But if democracy is a way of life and not just a ballot in its box, then we can see democracy acted out all around us in Vekllei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cities are living things; they are made up of people hurrying and talking and building. In cities, we see Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s centralised society/decentralised life contradiction lean towards &amp;ldquo;deurbanisation&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;local transparency&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four principles of Vekllei life are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-management and self-interest through Sundress Municipalism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classification of property as an independent social organ, like nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abolishment of currency and currency-substitutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economic feminisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranked in order of their immediacy to the average person, we can see that &lt;em&gt;Sundress Municipalism&lt;/em&gt; is at the core of Vekllei life. What exactly is &lt;em&gt;Sundress Municipalism&lt;/em&gt;? It describes the organisation of Vekllei cities, which are arranged around the following principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local employment, or &amp;ldquo;commutelessness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slumlessness, beautification, and a will to architecture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Property stewardship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open air and clean water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Land usefulness (&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;friendliness&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Private ownership of private needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public ownership of public needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These values are oriented around a deeply Vekllei valuation of space, and the accessibility of place and material to ordinary people. They also reveal some peculiarities in their listing &amp;ndash; what constitutes a private and public need, and what constitutes ownership, are deeply spiritual concepts in Vekllei, and their use here relies on uncoded intuition. Let us not forget we are dealing with a state that considers itself to be the human ambassador of the ground on which it sits, and so &amp;ldquo;public&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;private&amp;rdquo; include the nonhuman in their metrics. This is how, much to the amusement of foreigners, buildings can and often do &amp;ldquo;own themselves&amp;rdquo; in Vekllei. Most ownership is proved by stewardship; the use of space. The person who works the shop and lives above it, owns the shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image depicts the Vekllei city of Adouisneh, the florid culture capital of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Northwest. It is one of the &amp;ldquo;Five Crowning Cities&amp;rdquo; of Vekllei, measured by population and cultural significance, and was the site of one of the earliest parliaments in the world, centuries before the monarchy would come to power. You can see here the tension between old-world European planning and new-world Sundress Municipalism in the architecture and layout of this city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cactus bloom is beyond any bloom, I think, manufactured by plants anywhere in the world. And there you have an interesting syllogism, haven’t you? The desperate nature of the armed plant and the exquisite, beautiful efflorescence it produces. Something to think about. There you see, revealed, some processes of nature, the significance of which I don’t gather at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;Frank Lloyd Wright, Nov. 1952&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps urbanised modernity is the cactus, and Sundress Municipalism is the blossom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not that Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s feminised Municipalism represents a clean departure from how cities look and feel, but instead constitutes a rethinking of urbanism; it is an ideology of homesteads, decentralisation, clean air, food production, arts and crafts, leisure, and the spirit, if not the literal presence of, &amp;ldquo;disposable income.&amp;rdquo; It is not enough that a factory should be the property of the people who work in it; a factory should become adjacent to the home, a part of it, designed in ways that benefit the good instincts of ordinary people. Vekllei is a celebration of the architect; automatons may now do a lot of the work, but all design is deeply human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the heart of the dream. Vekllei is not a big enough country to gift each person an acre of land to do with as they wish; it is, however, sophisticated enough to decentralise that &amp;ldquo;local acre&amp;rdquo; among the community, cultivating those same values in a modern skyline and allowing the city to flow across the landscape, changing as it responds to the place around it. Ownership is important; stewardship is especially important. By allowing people to own and use land, you give them dignity. Above all, design and architecture are important for the same reason spatiality is important &amp;ndash; they give presence to and emulsify work and leisure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the mid-twentieth century, modernism began to encircle the world and the architectural and urban images once projected as utopian began to fill real space. In the 1960s this reached a saturation point; utopia was, ironically, realised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;Karatani Kojin,&lt;/em&gt; Architecture as Metaphor, &lt;em&gt;1983&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This occurred because, upon realising that art must be removed from architecture in order to safeguard it against a looming &amp;ldquo;loss of subject,&amp;rdquo; avant-garde thinkers methodologically reestablished architecture as &amp;lsquo;construction&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; utilitarian efforts towards grand ideas. With art removed, architecture was able to close in on the inherent placelessness of utopia. In Vekllei, this approach is extant (though diminished by their absurd place-metaphysics) through &lt;em&gt;Newda&lt;/em&gt;, the indigenous design ideology that continues to service architecture through social, rather than artistic, methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;big idea&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;Newda&lt;/em&gt; is an agent for, wrapped up in &lt;em&gt;Sundress Municipalism&lt;/em&gt;, is very straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city should be everywhere and nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Adouisneh, despite its thousand years of history, we can see postwar &lt;em&gt;Newda&lt;/em&gt; come to life in its integration and decentralisation of the &amp;ldquo;city&amp;rdquo; as a living process, moving people and their concerns closer together. Developed only with the consent of the architect, Vekllei has become an architocracy, serving decentralised, pleasant living through bureau monopolies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, after all, it is the necessity of state authority that is the cactus, and the middle-class free lifestyles of Vekllei people that make up the blossom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/ju5vmu/how_to_speak_vekllei_and_a_new_website/&#34;&gt;Read here&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;|&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;posts/2020-11-14-language&#34;&gt;Archived here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For all you&amp;rsquo;ve seen of Vekllei and her characters&lt;/strong&gt;, you&amp;rsquo;ve never heard a single one of them speak. This post marks a little exploration into the Vekllei language, and a &amp;lsquo;soft launch&amp;rsquo; of my website, &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net&#34;&gt;https://millmint.net&lt;/a&gt;. The proper launch will come at the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will briefly discuss some elements shown in this infographic, &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/language&#34;&gt;but a large article on the language has been drafted here&lt;/a&gt;. If you have some interest in constructed language, and some of the more playful aspects of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s evolving utopian communication systems, I encourage you to take a look at it. The website is incomplete, and both the articles on characters and Vekllei itself are very incomplete. Otherwise, a growing archive, essays, and issues of the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; Bulletin are all available. Have a poke around, and let me know if anything breaks! The site has dark mode, if you&amp;rsquo;re a gamer. Just click the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;one-language-many-parts&#34;&gt;One Language, Many Parts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To borrow from the article linked above, the Vekllei language has six core systems often referred to as sublanguages. They are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/language/#21--spoken-vekllei&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoken Vekllei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is everyday spoken language. It draws from two glossaries with different meanings and feelings, called &lt;em&gt;Oa&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Loh&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/language/#22--topet&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which are logographic characters (occasionally characterised as hieroglyphs). Like other pictographic languages, &lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt; characters can be broken down into repeating components, called &lt;em&gt;Topotte&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/language/#23--rapotenne&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapotenne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is the traditional logographic language of names. It is much older than Topet, and has more in common with spiritual runes than modern logography.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/language/#24--potenne&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potenne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, lit. “&lt;em&gt;Hand-Talk&lt;/em&gt;”, is a sign language that incorporates gestures and signing to add meaning to emotion to spoken language, and occasionally in place of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/language/#25--upotenne&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upotenne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, lit. “&lt;em&gt;Spirit-Hand-Talk&lt;/em&gt;”, as the recreation of runes in human form, used limitedly in spiritual ritual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/language/#26--vekllei-semaphore&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei Semaphore&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the codification of colour and shape. Traditionally limited to colour, shape and pattern are now also included in &lt;em&gt;Vekllei Semaphore&lt;/em&gt;, in which full sentences can be formed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;in-this-picture&#34;&gt;In This Picture&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see various parts of the Vekllei sublanguages on display, including &lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rapotenne&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Potenne&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Vekllei Semaphore&lt;/em&gt;. Before Cobian gets close enough to say hello, Tzipora has already delivered a devastating compliment via a simple three-finger tap to the palm, admiring how she looks. A couple of descriptions of Tzipora written in &lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt; have been annotated on her left, to demonstrate its use, including a tongue-twister (&amp;ldquo;She always tucks her shirt&amp;rdquo; becomes &amp;ldquo;Louisn Laismoh Loah Liousmineh&amp;rdquo;). You&amp;rsquo;ll notice &lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt; looks especially hieroglyphic, even by pictographic standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora&amp;rsquo;s full Blood Name is spelled out in &lt;em&gt;Rapotenne&lt;/em&gt; below, which is markedly different from &lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt; in history, characters and grammar. Most formal names in Vekllei employ a seal in place of writing it out in full ornamentation, which has been provided below along with a formal signature. Her signature is entirely pictographic; elements are arranged according to symbolic value, rather than phonological legibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the right, we can see an example of how Semaphore lives up to its name through its presence on flags, reinforcing and communicating information without conventional literacy. Also shown are a handful of basic symbols as they relate to authority, with the landscape of Vekllei superseding all human organs. Their colours matter, and so their meanings are more complex than what is described here &amp;ndash; for example, a small black circle refers to a human being, but an orange one refers to an arctic person (usually Vekllei).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have a breakdown of the word &lt;em&gt;comiya&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/language/#222-phonetic-reading&#34;&gt;also looked at here&lt;/a&gt;), which means &amp;ldquo;friend.&amp;rdquo; Tzipora and Cobian are &lt;em&gt;comiya&lt;/em&gt;, and Moise and Cobian are&amp;hellip; sort of &lt;em&gt;comiya&lt;/em&gt;. The introduction here of &lt;em&gt;phonetic complements&lt;/em&gt;, which are duplicate consonant-pairs used to slightly alter the semantic meaning of a word without changing its pronunciation, allows the idea of a &amp;ldquo;friend&amp;rdquo; to be conceptualised in many different ways, to encompass all sorts of relationships. This one here implies a sort of naïve love (by using characters for late autumn, young woman and a glacial beach, all pronounced /k/.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limpettes are tails that underline vowel-forms called &lt;em&gt;hieyerette&lt;/em&gt; to enhance legibility. Although ornamented &lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt; has visually distinct consonant-pairings, business &lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt; does not generally use superscript and so limpettes designate the vowel-form. If you&amp;rsquo;re a bit lost, that&amp;rsquo;s okay. It&amp;rsquo;s in the main article, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to make this post too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can imagine then, even with only a handful of examples of language in practice here, how complex Vekllei can become as phonological and semantic meaning compound, combine and seperate in different forms and contexts. The spoken word can be altered by the physical gesture, and the physical gesture can be altered by the written word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That about wraps up this brief analysis of the infographic above. Thanks for reading, and please let me know here if you have any questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your patience this month, it&amp;rsquo;s been slow and hard. With the first pages of the comic around the corner and the site launching at the end of the month, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot to look forward to. Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the light shifted just right&lt;/strong&gt;, the ceramic tiles and concrete footpaths twinkled like water off the back of a swan. 16th Century witches could build a hut in the woods and forage for herbs; 21st Century witches were susceptible to modernist persuasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Demotic Meeting Hall was constructed twenty years prior as the main meeting hall of the National Dockworker’s Union. Situated on the coast, and along the recently-built monorail line to Roya, it dominated the coastline like a mythic lighthouse. Where the cathedrals of Europe built spires to God, Vekllei built towers for dockmen. At 112 meters tall, the hall’s colossal window structures were awesome within, and its massive bronze ornament glittered for miles. It was palatial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dockworker’s Union moved west to Montre at some point, so these days it was simply the Roya Demotic Community Hall. It was used for all sorts of things, not least of which domestic tourism. Its lookout provided views across the North-West Fjords. When Tzipora first arrived in Vekllei, the scale and decadence of it appealed to her enormously. It was depicted on her language booklet, and since then she’d developed a minor fascination with the structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She got her chance to visit upon her invitation to a costume party hosted by the Chef’s Concern. Tzipora is a witchy sort of person, and the idea of going as a witch appealed to her. She already had the wardrobe — as Cobian remarked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’ve put on a hat and you’re holding a stick — that’s it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s my costume,” Zelda said. “I’m a witch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see her here attempting to recreate the sumptuous curve of the Meeting Hall in witch form.&lt;/p&gt;
