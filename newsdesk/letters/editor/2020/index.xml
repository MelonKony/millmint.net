      <description>Letters From the Editor — Nov. Update for Patrons ✉️  EDITOR  Letters  Hello my lovelies,
Just a short update on where I’m at as we pass mid-month. I’ve pushed a couple of things back a day or two to finish a very cool/special post. You’ll see it on the reddit soon — it’ll be a really nice painting, and nothing like I’ve ever done before. Before the weekend.</description>

      <description>Letters From the Editor — Dec. Update for Patrons ✉️  EDITOR  Letters  Hello beloved patrons,
This is your monthly update for the Petticoat Project.
There’s a  new post up on the subreddit and a  new article up on the website — a big one, about Vekllei, although it’s missing a history and culture section. Those are coming soon.
I won’t be mucking around on the website forever — trust me, I have no intention of abandoning my traditional post format for dry wiki articles — but it makes good infrastructure, and good infrastructure allows for growth and it also helps support new projects, like the comic.</description>
