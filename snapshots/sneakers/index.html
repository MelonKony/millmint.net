</blockquote>

<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>eadie sat in the sun beneath the carriage window with her arm on the sill, flicking her fingers in the warm wind that rushed in. She&rsquo;d sat like this every afternoon for the forty-five minute commute home on the Blue Line, which ran from the university out to The Valley, where she was staying. She brought her arm in from the sill and rotated it in front of her, wondering if she was getting more brown, and then ran it along her forehead where sweat had beaded.</p>
<p>Three people sat opposite her, like an audience. One of the girls, short and dark, had put her sneakers on the empty seat next to Beadie, and the other sat straight up in the lap of a huge man, who held her arms and caressed her fingers like a lover. None of them was older than twenty-five but the big guy had an old face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you think any more about it?&rsquo; said the short, dark girl, leaning forward. Her name was Anvi.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I think I&rsquo;d rather just go to the lawns,&rsquo; Beadie said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t feel comfortable going by myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The big guy with the girl in his lap spoke up. &lsquo;Trixie and me&rsquo;re going.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know what it&rsquo;s like with you two. You say you&rsquo;ll show up and have a some drinks, then you go missing for a couple hours.&rsquo; Anvi said, putting on a posh voice that sounded a bit like Beadie&rsquo;s accent. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know <em>what</em> you get up to, but you&rsquo;re no good to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not my scene,&rsquo; Beadie said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So make it your scene. It&rsquo;s a good way to meet people, and I want to meet someone who isn&rsquo;t Indian.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;George isn&rsquo;t Indian. He&rsquo;s Bangladeshi and you ought to know the difference,&rsquo; the Big Guy said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all the same shit!&rsquo; Avia said and slapped her legs, then withdrew her feet from Beadie&rsquo;s seat. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sick of it, I swear to <em>god</em> I&rsquo;m going to move to Oslola and marry a viking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Beadie smirked but she didn&rsquo;t feel like hearing this again. She looked out of the window, and she watched the rooftops flying past. The bright streets of Cama were mostly light stone cut up by canals, but periodically great big seagrape trees flashed past and cast a green shadow inside the carriage. They whipped the open windows as they passed and Beadie pulled her arm inside. A moment later the train slowed and turned, and she could see the locomotive ahead of them.</p>
<p>Today marked six months in Cama, a constituent republic of the great big Vekllei superstate. It was hard to believe in her grandfather&rsquo;s time that these pretty little stone houses and courtyards had been wooden shacks and tin roofs. It was hard to believe it had once been called Grenada; that this all had been part of the British Empire. Britain had been her home six months ago. Now, in its former colony, it seemed lost to time.</p>
<p>She shifted in her seat and put her back to the window. Her connection to Cama was abstract and distant, and her connection to Vekllei as a whole was basically administrative. She was part-Caman, and she looked like them. Maybe, in her British provinciality, she had thought that was enough. But she knew she was a foreigner. It was not that she believed in bloodlines or inherited memory; she was a mathematician, or going to be one. But if she indulged that feeling, she had expected this place to feel a little more familiar.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What about coffee, then, on the lawns,&rsquo; Anvi said, looking like a dog that had been scolded. &lsquo;I can get ice coffee from Morrison&rsquo;s and we can study on the lawns.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a pitiful compromise masking total capitulation, and Beadie laughed and accepted it. Anvi smiled her big smile and put her shoes back on the seat across from her. She was funny, Anvi; a third-generation Tamil girl from Sri Lanka or some such. Vekllei people &ndash; and despite their exotic federalism, they did think of themselves as &lsquo;Vekllei people&rsquo; &ndash; often had ancestry in random places. At one time it seemed like nearly every educated person from a poor or developing country was moving here; famous Vekllei; radical Vekllei; the country with no history, no race; no expectation of how you should live.</p>
<p>Anvi was short with rich, ocher skin and moles all over her arms. Her hair was short and dark and went every which way so that it looked like black flames around her head. She looked at you intensely and with all of her attention. Beadie watched her as her friend rummaged in her purse for lip balm. She didn&rsquo;t know much about her; had never been to her home. She was studying biochemistry, she remembered, but who knows otherwise. Anvi did not really talk about stuff like that.</p>
<p>Trixie sat next to Anvi in the lap of her lover, Gus. Vekllei people often had lovers; they were open about that sort of thing, and that&rsquo;s what Gus called her. But Beadie suspected it meant something more for Trixie, because Gus was all she talked about. There was always the casual question, weighed heavy with implication &ndash; where would you like to go after you get your masters? It surprised Beadie, because the natural assumption about Vekllei&rsquo;s ambiguous &rsquo;liberated society&rsquo; was that there was a lot of casual, polygamous and free sex. In her experience, they were not much different in desire to any Briton, although perhaps more successful at it.</p>
<p>She watched them play with their hands and the warmth of his touch somewhat jealously. Beadie had never had a serious relationship; she was too busy. Anvi did her best to ignore them but she could tell it bothered her too. Beadie had the miserable feeling that Trixie and Gus liked the envy their affection brought on.</p>
<p>How they all ended up as friends she could scarcely remember. They had met at one of the university socials, and they all lived in The Valley, so it must have emerged organically on this train. The lovers liked the company, and Anvi had seemed like she wanted a friend. Beadie was the foreigner; and foreigners rarely choose their friends.</p>
<p>It was the early afternoon and the warmest part of the day, and the carriage was cooled only by the open windows and swivelling fans mounted to the roof. They called these &lsquo;student&rsquo;s cars.&rsquo; The air-conditioned cars up the front were more comfortable but sealed in. It was polite to leave them to the working public, and the students liked the fresh air rushing in anyway. At some point they started playing the same game they always did, where they all looked at Beadie and asked her about life in Britain. This game turned every competent Vekllei adult into a child, staring in amazement, shaking their head like the price of a television was a spiritual revelation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So for a good television, like a <em>really</em> good one, is maybe twelve thousand dollars,&rsquo; Anvi was saying, since this was her favourite game. &lsquo;Sorry, I mean pounds. Twelve thousand pounds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For a really good one, one with a big technicolour screen and classy oak panelling, maybe. But most people own a much cheaper one, for maybe a few hundred pounds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how much work would you need to do,&rsquo; Anvi leaned forward and rested her mouth on her fingertips, &rsquo;to make twelve thousand pounds?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a lot of money. For an average person, that&rsquo;s maybe eight or ten months salary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And salary is the total amount of pounds, correct?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s what you get for working; your pay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bwoah,&rsquo; Anvi said, smacking her head like she always did about this time in the conversation. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d totally work eight months to have a television like that. That seems like a great deal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, but Anvi,&rsquo; Trixie said, still using Gus as a chair, &lsquo;you keep forgetting, we work half-days, they work full-days. They have televisions because they work so hard. So it would take you twice as long.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Still,&rsquo; Anvi said, nodding, &lsquo;I would really like to have a television.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This kind of conversation was surreal to be having in English. These people were not destitute foreigners stumbling through the English language; Anvi spoke English fluently and with a clear, though implacable, British accent. Despite their diverse appearances, they had all grown up speaking it.</p>
<hr>
<p>They were all dressed basically the same. The student uniform for university was voluntary, but everyone wore it, including some of the professors. The native Vekllei people had owned some variation of it almost all their lives, and it was just as natural to them as bringing their pens and books. It reflected a broader observation Beadie&rsquo;d noticed about Vekllei people, and the quirkiness of their society, which seemed both advanced and backwards.</p>
<p>The basic components were all the same; white shirt and socks, navy trousers and skirts; leather shoes and sneakers. And in Cama, it was almost always sneakers. Beadie could remember asking about it shortly after she&rsquo;d met Anvi. She had said something like, &lsquo;I like your shoes,&rsquo; and Anvi looked down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s just Dunlops, go get some,&rsquo; she had said, wagging her shoes. &lsquo;We can match.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dunlops? You mean the tyre company? The British tyre company?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How should I know! Dunlop makes shoes; they make most of the sneakers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Beadie found out later it was the same company, via a subsidiary owned in part by the Vekllei government. Such was the new frontier of this liberated society &ndash; fucking Dunlop tyres, here, the universal shoe of the anarchist. It was ridiculous and made some kind of sense. They made about a hundred different styles of tennis shoe, many of which looked stolen from the big European or Asian brands. In the rest of the world, the sneaker was a sports shoe &ndash; in Vekllei, it was worn everywhere, every day.</p>
<p>So Beadie did get some, the same place Vekllei people got anything; one of the massive department stores downtown that masked its true nature as a distribution centre for &lsquo;universal goods.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you didn&rsquo;t get the same pattern,&rsquo; Anvi had said after, sliding her foot up against Beadie&rsquo;s, comparing the colour of the candy cane pattern on the heel. &lsquo;We could have matched.&rsquo;</p>
