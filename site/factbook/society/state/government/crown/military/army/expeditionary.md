## Overview

The Expeditionary Corps is Vekllei's tip of the spear in combat. It is experienced, well-equipped, and highly mobile. It is also completely professionalised on a volunteer basis, unlike the Home Army.

## Commonwealth Legion

The Commonwealth Legion is the regular expeditionary army of Vekllei. It consists mostly of special forces designed for overseas and asymmetric fighting, and generally consists of the most elite Commonwealth units. It is presently a volunteer army, though conscripts can be mobilised from the Home Army in times of war.

During peacetime and low-intensity expeditionary fighting, the Commonwealth Legion consists of 32 regiments numbering around 35,000 men. Each regiment contains sustainment support units, but large tactical groups are supported by materiel from the Home Army. Like all offensively-postured Vekllei units, Commonwealth Legion regiments are ungrouped until they are assembled into tactical brigades for combat.
