The <span class="fi fi-min-health fis"></span> **Bureau of Health Services** reports to the [National Health Council](#national-health-council) and was set up to facilitate inter-agency cooperation and bridge communication gaps between agencies, services and professions. It advises the Health Parliament directly, and has a permanent representative in its board. Primarily, it advises the Health Parliament on healthcare developments and research, as well as the data it produces in its audits.

## Integrated Health Accounting Office

The Integrated Accounting Office (IAO-IHO) is a small outfit that helps collate accounting books into usable data for the [Health Accounting Office](#health-accounting-office). The public health system consists of thousands of hospitals, research labs and medical schools, and the IAO collects information that goes on to inform budgeting and health finance policy in other Health Parliament agencies.

## Integrated Care Office

The Integrated Care Office (ICO-IHO) facilitates treatment across multiple health services, most commonly transitions between inpatient treatment in hospitals to community care and support. It processes documents and paperwork automatically in its massive computers to alleviate the bureaucratic burden on hospital staff and nominated guardians.

## Commonwealth Public Health Archives

The Commonwealth Public Health Archives (CPHA-IHO) maintain a central, digitised database of all patient records, and develop and manufacture technologies used to collect and update information in the health system. This includes products like the Ward Health Terminal, which is also sold overseas. The CPHA also maintains the network infrastructure of the public health system, particularly in public hospitals and large clinics.
