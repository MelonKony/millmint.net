<p>The <span class="fi fi-ac"></span> <strong>Ascension Republic</strong> is a <a href="/republics/">constituent republic</a> in the Atlantic Ocean, and part of the commonwealth of Antarctica. Rocky, isolated and arid, Ascension is over 1,000km away from the Helena Republic, its closest neighbour.</p>
<p>Ascension is home to around 14,000 people, most of whom work for or are associated with the <a href="/cosmodrome/">Vekllei World Astroport</a> and the <a href="/military/">air service</a> base outside the capital, Adara. Its proximity to the equator and strategic centrality in the Atlantic have encouraged military development of the island republic, including air bases, telecommunications facilities, intelligence systems and satellite tracking. It is also home to a large naval dockyard, and rumoured to be part of the Vekllei air-delivered strategic nuclear arsenal.</p>
<p>Ascension was first settled by the <a style="color: rgb(200, 16, 47)" href="/uk/"><span class="fi fi-gb"></span></span> United Kingdom</a> in 1815, but remained a military outpost until the late 19th Century during the formation of the British Atlantic Territories. When the British Atlantic Territories became the independent Commonwealth of Oceans in 1935, Ascension became a dependent territory of the new country, and eventually inherited membership as a <a href="/republics/">republic</a> in <a style="color: var(--color-millmint)" href="/vekllei/"><span class="fi fi-com"></span> Vekllei</a> in the postwar period.</p>
<p>Around 90 square km, Ascension is a desert of volcanic lava flows and craters. Green Mountain has most of the island&rsquo;s vegetation, including small forests and land for growing fruits and vegetables, which are watered by small springs and catchment basins.</p>

<p>The <span class="fi fi-sh"></span> <strong>Ascension Republic</strong> is a <a href="/republics/">constituent republic</a> in the Atlantic Ocean, and part of the commonwealth of Antarctica. Of volcanic origin but with volcanic activity now extinct, Helena is home to around 20,000 people, most of whom live in the capital Plover. Its closest neighbour is the <a style="color: var(--color-millmint)" href="/vekllei/"><span class="fi fi-com"></span> Vekllei</a> republic of <a style="color: rgb(48, 106, 175)" href="/ascension/"><span class="fi fi-ac"></span> Ascension</a>.</p>
<p>Helena is dominated by steep, conspicuous terrain with dramatic volcanic features. It has a pleasant, temperate climate cooled by the South Atlantic trade winds, that range 15-30°C across seasons. Its flora has evolved for millions of years in isolation, and has extraordinary biodiversity across its unique species. Human settlement is concentrated in the highlands and in narrow valleys on its coast.</p>
<p>Helenians are descended mostly from British, South Asians and Africans most of whom were brought over as slaves and servants in the early colonial history of the island. The practice of slavery continued until the late 18th Century when it was outlawed across the British Empire.</p>
<p>Helena was among the islands transferred to the British Atlantic Territories, which would eventually become the first Commonwealth of Oceans. It inherited membership in Vekllei upon independence.</p>
<p>The Helena economy is dominated by municipal goods (green vegetables, land stewardship, crafts) as well as the Port of Helena in Plover that is an important supply station between other Vekllei Antarctic territories. Helena is also home to the South Atlantic Radar Array. It has a single airport on the east of the island, and is serviced by small tramlines and funiculars.</p>
