  Overview
  <a class="anchor" href="#overview">#</a>
</h2>
<p><span class="fi fi-com"></span> <strong>Vekllei</strong> is best conceptualised as a union of islands across the Atlantic Ocean. It is a commonwealth,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> the fourth in a series, and consists of many island republics that are connected by politics and prosperity, not geography or race. These islands range in size from the Selvas Islands of 160 people to the island of Oslola, of 8 million. Together, they amount to a single superstate that spans the entirety of the Atlantic as a great power.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth which unites them is highly centralised and built on common systems of governance and economic management. Member republics, known as <a href="/constituents/">constituents</a> cede aspects of governance like security, health and education to the Commonwealth. The country is colloquially known as <em>Vekllei</em>, an Algic <a href="/corcidi/">corcidi</a> word meaning <em>people of the sea and stars</em>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> It is also known as the <em>Commonwealth of Oceans</em>.</p>
<p>The capital of Vekllei is <a href="/comet/">Comet</a>, located west of the Azores Commonwealth in the Meteor Islands.</p>
<p>Vekllei is often regarded a nation by will, rather than of culture or geography. It consists of distant autonomous republics with many cultures and languages, and it has attracted millions of immigrants since independence looking to participate in building the unique aspects of its governance and society.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oslola, raging and now blinded, drew deep wounds into the Earth. Out of these wounds came fire, and out of fire came her child Oslola.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many Commonwealth republics have been inhabited for thousands of years, and have strong cultures and traditions that encompass many unique languages and faiths. The Kalina Isles and Oslola have archaeological evidence indicating settlement since at least 3000BC, and much of Oslolan and Kalan history has been recorded through poetry and <a href="/sagas/">Sagas</a>.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth of Oceans has precedence in the Oslolan Commonwealths that existed sporadically between 700 AD and 1600 AD. For this reason, the Vekllei Commonwealth is sometimes referred to as the &ldquo;4th Commonwealth,&rdquo; a phrase that draws a direct connection between Vekllei and the Oslolan Commonwealths.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Common history of the republics begins in 1710 AD, when Oslola and Kala capitulated to the Kingdom of Great Britain and became subjects the British Empire. In 1836, the British colonies in the Atlantic were reincorporated as the British Atlantic Territories. This colony was granted autonomy in 1838 and achieved dominion status in 1926, and lay the groundwork for Oslolan independence in 1935.</p>
<p>After the Second World War, the Oslolan Republic struggled through a series of crises that culminated in the fall of government and the establishment of the Atlantic Council in 1963, which severed ties with the UK. Rising territorial ambitions and erratic council rule saw relations strained and culminated in the Oslolan Civil War in 1992 and the exchange of nuclear weapons with the UK in 1995.</p>
<p>Oslolan territories, including Kala and Demon, were occupied between 1995 and 2017. Independence was granted in 2015, in which occupied territories ceded local rule to a union called the Vekllei Commonwealth. This Commonwealth is the foundation of modern Vekllei.</p>

<p>The Commonwealth is foremostly a union of Atlantic and Caribbean islands which, freed from colonial rule, have established a federal system to share common burdens and improve the lives of their oceangoing peoples.</p>
<p>Vekllei is a constitutional, federated country including <a href="/constituents/">six individual commonwealths</a> which share political features established by the <a href="/rose-council/">Council of Roses</a>.</p>
<p>It has a unique kind of federalism, with republics and territories orbiting central Commonwealth control at different distances. A common means of petitioning membership, or &ldquo;acceding&rdquo; to the Commonwealth is via its international organisation called the <a href="/oceans-council/">Council of Oceans</a>.</p>
<p>Although regionally and culturally diverse, Commonwealth government is centralised and the state functions as a single country. These republics have large degrees of autonomy, but are unilaterally governed by the central Commonwealth government as an intact state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vekllei&rdquo; is the phrase for the culture and ideology of the Commonwealth state, and is used interchangeably to refer to the country.</p>

<p>The Commonwealth has a hybrid moneyless system called <em>commons</em>, in which money is not used in daily life. In the place of money, the commons system exists as a series of social economies and usufructs. Rather than purchasing products as consumers, staples like food and clothing are subsidised by groups of companies known as <a href="/bureaus/"><em>bureaus</em></a>. Everything else is produced in the colloquial moneyless market, often unreliably.</p>
<p>Money is used in a seperate industrial and financial market called the <em>financialised commons</em>. In this market, Vekllei has two currencies known as <a href="/factbook/society/state/finance/#vekllei-crown-vk"><em>Vekllei</em></a> and <a href="/factbook/society/state/finance/#government-crown-ak"><em>Government Crowns</em></a>, which are used by the government, industry and foreigners to interact with the Vekllei economy and purchase securities and financial instruments. Money is also used as a means of exchange between Commonwealth republics as a privilege of the state.</p>
<p>The country has maintained high unemployment since independence, sliding between 5-10% for most of the postwar period.</p>
<p>The commons economy relies on a system of participatory work, encouraged by the simple and universal rule to be employed, called <a href="/consosva/">Consosva</a>. The standard of living in Vekllei is quite good and is unique among modern societies today.</p>
<p>In industrialised regions like Oslola, the <em>commons</em> has a sophisticated network of incentives and social engineering to facilitate its quality of life. In other regions, particularly scattered across the many archipelagos and small islands of the Commonwealth, self-sufficiency is more common and dependent on fishing, community and codependence.</p>

<p>Employment in Vekllei has many unique features, not least of which is its functional moneylessness. Except for Verde,<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> no republic of the Commonwealth uses money in daily life. Work in Vekllei is characterised by lifetime employment and seniority-based advancement, though this culture is changing in some industries.

<p>This work environment ranks highly for competitiveness but lowly for economic freedom, as the structure of the commons inhibits scaling businesses beyond social dimensions. Private business ownership is most common in small communities with strong social bonds, particularly in rural or agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Vekllei people generally have aspirations of power rather than wealth, and work towards that goal in the absence of a wage. Other reasons for work include its strong social dimensions and relaxed ethic, which are facilitated by a professional but gentle work culture that retains short working days and frequent tea breaks.</p>

<p>Vekllei separates its markets to allow for money to be used by industry and the government as part of trade and business.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Commons</strong> is the moneyless and participatory domestic market.</li>
<li><strong>The Financialised Commons</strong> are the moneyed industrial and international markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most Vekllei people never interact with the financialised commons, but it plays a significant role in the economy. Vekllei&rsquo;s history as a series of entrepôts and its international neutrality have made it desirable as a place of business and investment, and many foreign companies bank in Vekllei. Vekllei is a major commodities and securities exchange, via the <a href="/factbook/society/state/finance/#international-markets">Vekllei International Market</a>.</p>
<p>Despite its international investment and low barriers to trade, the Commonwealth government is a major participant in the financialised commons and contributes significantly to its currency pool. Vekllei has the second-largest foreign currency reserves in the world.</p>

<p>The right to property is protected by the <a href="/constitution/">Vekllei Constitution</a>, and important in North Vekllei culture. Home ownership is a foundation of <a href="/municipalities/">Atlantic Municipalism</a>, and is determined by stewardship of land.</p>
<p>In the Vekllei legal system, land has three competing agents:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Steward &ndash; the occupier and worker of the land</li>
<li>The Public &ndash; the community, municipality and state</li>
<li>The Sovereign &ndash; the land itself, as a seperate sovereign kingdom of nature</li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than defined legal owners, land ownership in Vekllei is a pluralistic competition between these three agents. The claim to ownership grows with time and use, and so it is possible for any agent to litigate property provided a reasonable claim to ownership can be provided.</p>
<p>In North Vekllei, where <a href="/upen/">Upen</a> folk metaphysics are practiced, the Sovereign is treated literally as a competing agent. In other parts of Vekllei, like the Kalina Isles, it is treated as nature itself or the environment. In both cases, the interests of the Sovereign are established by special prosecutors in court.</p>
<p>Nearly 96% of Vekllei people own their homes, among the highest rates of home-ownership in the world.</p>

<p>Vekllei has championed the nonalignment movement since independence. Situated between NATO powers (North America and Western Europe) and between exploited developing regions (South America and West Africa), the Commonwealth uses nonalignment simultaneously as an instrument of peace and intervention. It has close relations with other nonaligned countries, including Yugoslavia and India.</p>
<p>This historical neutrality and geographic accessibility has encouraged the founding and relocation of international organisations to Vekllei. Vekllei chairs the <a href="/oceans-council/">Council of Oceans</a> and has many international organisations headquartered across its republics, including the International Federation of Journalists and the new United Nations Office.</p>
<p>Many Vekllei people work overseas for a period of time, either individually or as part of Commonwealth-sponsored programmes. The country is among the largest exporters of doctors and teachers in the world, many of whom work in West and Southern Africa.</p>

<p>Commonwealth society is internationalist owing to its internal distance and diversity, and so aspects of its political and cultural beliefs are considered universal. Atlantic Laicity overrules religious practice where it violates Commonwealth values or law &ndash; for example the wearing of long veils in schools and public institutions is prohibited. Similarly, the Commonwealth considers democracy to be a foundational human right and belief in it is essential for participation in society.</p>
<p>Because the unmoneyed <em>Commons</em> economy is essentially unregulated beyond the <a href="/basic-laws/">Vekllei Basic Laws</a>, Commonwealth society has strong anarchist currents.</p>

Most of the Vekllei republics are serviced by a dense network of trains and trams, and connected to each other via ferries, passenger jets and helijets.</p>

<p>Public transit ranges from state-of-the-art maglev lines in Oslola to century-old steam locomotives in Verde, operated by <a href="/rail/">Vekllei National Rail</a>. The sophistication of the network allows almost any citizen of the Commonwealth to travel from their doorstep to the moon entirely via public transport.</p>
