  COSMOKOS
</b>
<p>The <em>Ministry of Defence</em> (COSMOKOS) represents the Sovereign Armed Forces of the Vekllei Commonwealth in the Interior Government, which are consolidated under the <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/commonwealth/security/#commonwealth-military-command">Commonwealth Military Command</a>. COSMOKOS does not exercise command authority over the armed forces of Vekllei, and serves instead as the ministerial liaison between the Commonwealth Military Command and the Interior Government. Common responsibilities of COSMOKOS include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recruitment of citizens and foreigners into the Commonwealth armed forces.</li>
<li>Procuring equipment to meet the Vekllei obligation towards the Commonwealth armed forces.</li>
<li>Training citizens and foreigners for the branches of the Commonwealth armed forces.</li>
<li>Conducting scientific military research.</li>
<li>Policing and security of Vekllei territories and waters.</li>
</ul>
<p>COSMOKOS also provides security services domestically, and is responsible for most internal police and security organisations in Vekllei.</p>
<div class="outline ">
  <h3 id="armed-forces-of-vekllei">
  Armed Forces of Vekllei
  <a class="anchor" href="#armed-forces-of-vekllei">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The <em>Armed Forces of Vekllei</em>, arranged under the COSMOKOS ministry, are unusual in that they do not have control directly over troops or equipment. The actual armed forces of Vekllei, known as the <a href="/factbook/society/state/palace/military/">Crown Armed Forces</a>, are a sovereign feature of the country and as such are placed under direct supervision of the <a href="/factbook/society/state/palace/">Palace of Vekllei</a> &ndash; seperate from the Vekllei and Commonwealth governments.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Armed Forces of Vekllei, an agency-level body under control of COSMOKOS, is to integrate the Crown Armed Forces with the interior government, and facilitate the employ of Vekllei people in the Armed Forces.</p>
<h4 id="department-of-communications">
  Department of Communications
  <a class="anchor" href="#department-of-communications">#</a>
</h4>
<p>The <em>Department of Communications</em> is a bureau-level organisation of the Armed Forces responsible for coordinating public information about military activities. It also produces several newspapers and periodicals for servicemen through subservient publishing houses.</p>
<h4 id="department-of-compulsory-service">
  Department of Compulsory Service
  <a class="anchor" href="#department-of-compulsory-service">#</a>
</h4>
<p>The <em>Department of Compulsory Service</em> (DoCS, also CS) oversees the Vekllei Compulsory Service Scheme, a hybrid civilian/military conscription law that requires four years from each Commonwealth citizen between the ages of 18 and 32. Despite reporting to the Armed Forces of COSMOKOS, the DoCS does not facilitate widespread conscription and mobilisation of the civilian population, a role served by the <a href="#department-of-mobilisation">DoM</a>. Instead, it is responsible primarily for supervising the fulfilment of the Compulsory Service Scheme, and administrating the conscription and training of Vekllei citizens, including in civilian and industrial roles.</p>
<h4 id="department-of-foreign-affairs">
  Department of Foreign Affairs
  <a class="anchor" href="#department-of-foreign-affairs">#</a>
</h4>
<p>The <em>Department of Foreign Affairs</em> (DoFA) coordinates military affairs with states overseas, including members of the Commonwealth. Responsibilities include facilitating military exchange and cooperation with foreign militaries, as well as relations-focussed work with strategic and allied nations.</p>
<h4 id="department-of-mobilisation">
  Department of Mobilisation
  <a class="anchor" href="#department-of-mobilisation">#</a>
</h4>
<p>The <em>Department of Mobilisation</em> (DoM) is responsible for recruitment in peacetime, and conscription in the outbreak of war. In the Floral Period, Vekllei defensive doctrine aims to make the country &ldquo;ungovernable,&rdquo; requiring widespread mobilisation and training of the civilian population. Unlike the <a href="#department-of-compulsory-service">DoCS</a>, the DoM is concerned primarily with the combat effectiveness of the mobilised population, and is generally distinguished in its strategic military thinking.</p>
<h4 id="department-of-peacekeeping">
  Department of Peacekeeping
  <a class="anchor" href="#department-of-peacekeeping">#</a>
</h4>
<p>The <em>Department of Peacekeeping</em> (DoP) coordinates Vekllei&rsquo;s overseas peacekeeping operations. Vekllei is among the largest contributors of men and equipment towards United Nations Peacekeeping Forces, which are responsible to and administrated by the DoP while deployed. The Department of Peacekeeping also engages with international mechanisms for peace, and contributes personnel as part of foreign aid or disaster relief.</p>
<h4 id="intelligence-liaison-office">
  Intelligence Liaison Office
  <a class="anchor" href="#intelligence-liaison-office">#</a>
</h4>
<p>The <em>Intelligence Liaison Office</em> is a specialised office that coordinates military intelligence between Vekllei&rsquo;s security apparatuses, particularly those of the <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/commonwealth/security/#national-intelligence-directorate">National Intelligence Directorate</a>. Intelligence gathering in Vekllei is performed by a variety of mostly autonomous espionage organs, and the purpose of the Liaison is to authenticate and prepare intelligence for military use. It includes the following branches.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>National Intelligence Branch</strong>: Coordination of intelligence gathered by security apparatuses with Armed Forces.</li>
<li><strong>Civilian Intelligence Branch</strong>: Coordination of intelligence gathered by industrial and civilian sectors (in occupied territories, for example) with Armed Forces and security apparatuses.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Intelligence Branch</strong>: Coordination of intelligence gathered by the Armed Forces with security apparatuses.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sovereign-liaison-office">
  Sovereign Liaison Office
  <a class="anchor" href="#sovereign-liaison-office">#</a>
</h4>
<p>The <em>Sovereign Liaison Office</em> is a specialised office intended to link the command of the <a href="/factbook/society/state/palace/military/">Crown Armed Forces of Vekllei</a> with COSMOKOS, an interior ministry with no direct control over troops of the Crown. Although it is the <em>de facto</em> office of communication with the Crown forces, in practice communication generally occurs directly with the relevant COSMOKOS department. The purpose of the Sovereign Liaison is mostly as a democracy-advocate, supervising the COSMOKOS departments as an anti-corruption watchdog similar to other democracy-advocates. It also ensures COSMOKOS operations do not affect sovereign operations</p>

  <a class="anchor" href="#bureau-of-supply">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The <em>Bureau of Supply</em> is a specialised defence organ that coordinates supply and logistics for the Crown Armed Forces and security services of Vekllei, including its policing and intelligence services. The Bureau of Supply also administrates the network of Crown Ordnance Factories and the production and acquisition of aircraft and vehicles. It is not responsible for strategic decisions about the make and type of supply, only the facilitation and distribution of the purchase.

<p>The <em>Ministry of Light &amp; Water</em> (COSMOLA) is responsible for the government monopoly on water and energy in Vekllei. Through its statutory corporations (SCs) and public utilities, the ministry is responsible for the vast majority of energy production in the Vekllei Islands and contributes significantly to energy research through its network of  laboratories. Increasingly, COSMOLA investment has indicated an interest in energy and water conservation. Common responsibilities of COSMOLA include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintenance and operation of utilities that provide Vekllei people with electricity and water.</li>
<li>Production and conservation of energy and water.</li>
<li>Investment and research into emerging physical sciences.</li>
<li>Advising energy and water policy to the <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/interior">Interior Parliament</a>.</li>
<li>Nuclear energy security.</li>
</ul>
<p>COSMOLA is the third-largest ministry by persons employed, and its sub-agencies and SCs are responsible for a number of iconic pieces of Vekllei infrastructure, including the <a href="/posts/2019-09-15-reactor/">Expo &lsquo;74 Experimental Reactor</a> and the <a href="/posts/2020-04-21-hydro/">Ou Hydroburo Complex</a>.</p>

</h3>
<p>The <em>Vekllei Electric Commission</em> (VEC, also Thunderburo) is responsible for the state monopoly on electricity generation in Vekllei. Although the VEC is structured as a bureau company, its subsidiaries are state-owned and consequently operates similarly to other agency-level departments of the <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/interior">Interior Parliament</a>. The VEC consists of multiple subcommissions dedicated to unique types of electricity generation in Vekllei, primarily through hydro-electric, geothermal and nuclear methods.</p>
<h4 id="magma-electric-commission">
  Magma-Electric Commission
  <a class="anchor" href="#magma-electric-commission">#</a>
</h4>
<p>The Vekllei <em>Magma-Electric Commission</em> (colloquially <em>The Magma</em> or MEC) oversees geothermal electricity production in Vekllei. Because of Vekllei&rsquo;s location over the rift of the European and American continental plates, widespread geothermal electricity production is widespread and makes up the majority of commercial and domestic electricity consumption in Vekllei. Forty-six MEC plants of varying sizes supply clean renewable energy to Vekllei households, and waste heat is used to heat greenhouses Vekllei depends on for food production.</p>

<p>The Vekllei <em>Hydro-Electric Commission</em> (colloquially <em>The Hydro</em>, not to be confused with the <a href="#vekllei-water-commission"><em>Hydroburo</em></a>) oversees hydro-electric electricity generation in Vekllei, particularly in the glacial regions of the Vekllei Islands and Kala. Dramatic mountain terrain in the interior of the Vekllei Islands proved suitable candidates for hydro-electric dams, which were mostly constructed in the pre-war and immediate post-war era. Vekllei&rsquo;s oldest dam in <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/ou/">Ou</a> has been operating continuously for 156 years.</p>

<p>The Vekllei <em>Nuclear-Electric Commission</em> (also <em>Atomic Vekllei</em> or NEC) oversees nuclear electricity generation in Vekllei. Nuclear energy has proliferated in postwar Vekllei, and satisfies the Commonwealth&rsquo;s growing industrial power demands. Most commercial nuclear plants in Vekllei use uranium-233 reactor fuels, processed mostly at the National Centrifuge &amp; Enrichment Plant in Speidisn. Vekllei reactors mostly of a molten salt type. The NEC maintains 56 plants in total across the Commonwealth, most of which are located in the Vekllei Islands or Kala.</p>

<p>The <em>Vekllei Water Commission</em> (Hydroburo) is responsible for providing potable drinking water, wastewater and stormwater services to the Vekllei Islands and most Commonwealth members. Water in Vekllei is universal and of good quality. The Hydroburo also maintains offices for sewerage, conservation, and construction.</p>
<p>In the Vekllei Islands and Kala, most drinking water comes from fresh glacial runoff that requires minimal treating. Industrial water consumption is provided by nuclear desalination plants operated by the Hydroburo.</p>

<p>The <em>Emergency Light and Water Authority</em> (EVA) is a specialised department of the Ministry of Light and Water designed to mitigate interruption to electricity and water supply. Its mandate includes the security of utility infrastructure and disaster preparation. In the event of major interruption to the utilities supervised by the Ministry, the EVA would assume direct control of the Hydro and Thunderburos and coordinate their recovery. Threats include both natural disasters like volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, as well as damage from conventional or nuclear war.

<p>The <em>Standardisations Directorate</em> (SSD, also Standards Vekllei) works to unify management and supervision of state bodies and assets in Vekllei. It also mandates the responsibilities and visual identity of all departments of the Government and boroughs of the Commonwealth, including the appearance and manuals of style of Commonwealth infrastructure and publications. Its work includes both operating procedures and major brand elements like flags and logos, and specific linguistic and typographic features including typefaces, preferred punctuation and symbols. It has considerable authority over other departments, which usually lack autonomy to enforce their own visual identity independently. Most visual work for the Standardisations Directorate is performed by in-house designers and artists.</p>

It also advises <a href="/factbook/society/government/#standards-vekllei">GOSED</a> on changes to its technical, safety and design committees. It also routinely interfaces with the <a href="/factbook/society/government/#vekllei-commons-audit-committee">ADCA</a> for internal standards compliance.</p>
<p>Since private commerce in Vekllei exists outside of the bureau framework, the license of COMSTA is broader and flexible, and regularly relies upon contracted industry contacts to fill places on its less defined technical committees.</p>
