<p><strong>The Commonwealth Senate</strong> is the upper house of Commonwealth republics, and has special legislative powers to approve, defer or reject proposed laws. The Senate cannot introduce most types of legislation, and so acts as a check on the [National Assemblies], which collectively form a federated Lower House.</p>
<p>Membership in the senate is proportional to the number of Constituents and Territories. Constituents submit 5 members, and territories submit 2.</p>
<p>The Senate is able to form Commonwealth Committees and Commissions, which engage in special inquiry of concern to the country. Although the results of these bodies are not legally binding, they have significant influence on government and the public and help draw attention to issues that have not recieved government or public notice.</p>

<p>Municipalities in Vekllei are the predominant form of local government, and vary dramatically in scale, power and resources. They usually refer to council municipalities, which are bodies of elected industrial and political leaders of a community. This open-ended definition means that municipalities scale in Vekllei from tiny villages to major metropolitan areas.</p>
<p>Municipalities are the basis of Vekllei localism, a belief in local concern and decentralised decision-making. In general, Vekllei municipalism describes the places where society in abstract meets the individual, and so also has cultural and aesthetic qualities. The sum of a municipality is expressed in the <em>Atlantic Municipalist</em> tradition, which consists of the following principles:</p>
<blockquote class="hint panel">
  <div class="icon">
</div> 
  <div class="text"><p><strong>Principles of Atlantic Municipalism</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Local employment, or “commutelessness.”</li>
<li>Slumlessness, beautification, and a will to architecture.</li>
<li>Property stewardship.</li>
<li>Open air and clean water.</li>
<li>Land usefulness (&ldquo;friendliness&rdquo;).</li>
<li>Private ownership of private needs.</li>
<li>Public ownership of public needs.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>There are 14,000 municipalities across the Commonwealth. The usage of &lsquo;municipal&rsquo; can refer to a political council or the spirit of Atlantic Municipalism.</p>
