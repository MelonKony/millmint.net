<p>Commonwealth member-states usually maintain their own <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/interior/defence/">defence ministries</a>, and the CMC aims to standardise and consolidate defensive strength across the Commonwealth. It is made up of the following departments.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>General Council</strong>: CMC administration and parliament liaison.</li>
<li><strong>Department of War</strong>: All war-related strategic planning and activities, including preparation for operations.</li>
<li><strong>Department of Peacekeeping</strong>: All activities related to Vekllei peacekeeping and expeditionary operations.</li>
<li><strong>Department of Training &amp; Mobilisation</strong>: Standardisation of training and mobilisation of troops across the Commonwealth.</li>
<li><strong>Department of Communications</strong>: Coordination between the parliaments and the Palace, as well as public information.</li>

<p>The <span class="fi fi-min-noshem fis"></span> <strong>Commonwealth Intelligence Service</strong> (<em>National Intelligence</em>, or <em>Noshem</em>) is the secret service of <a class="slink"  style="color: var(--color-vekllei); background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-vekllei) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/world/vekllei/"><span class="fi fi-com"></span> Vekllei</a> and the Commonwealth’s primary covert intelligence apparatus abroad. It is concerned with intelligence-gathering, surveillance and operations external to the Commonwealth. It is organised into 40 semiautonomous outlines, which each may operate several offices. Noshem&rsquo;s sophisticated intelligence network and broad mandate contribute to its legendary reputation abroad, and conspiracies of its presence in almost every country.</p>
<p>Noshem is unique in its broad recruitment of foreigners, many of whom are promised citizenship and residency in Vekllei. Many Noshem outlines recruit locally, and manage foreign assets through Vekllei-born supervisors.</p>

Although its home office is in Vekllei Proper at N.I., it serves a different function to <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/commonwealth/security/#home-office-honi">HO/NI</a>, specialising in remote, dangerous and dirty work at the fringes of Vekllei intelligence control.</p>
