<p><strong>Consosva</strong> (a portmanteau of <em>consivismiosn sovis</em>, lit. &ldquo;<em>contributory service</em>&rdquo;) refers to a collection of laws that require adult citizens in Vekllei to be employed. The legal obligation is fairly straightforward and is easily avoided, and in practice acts as a form of moral pressure from the state.</p>
<p>Consosva is a legal obligation to register an occupation with your municipality, which forwards its ledger to the Vekllei government. This is to encourage productivity and discourage &ldquo;social parasitism,&rdquo; as a requirement to contribute to the wealth of society. Failure to do so is considered a crime and is usually penalised with community service.</p>
<p>Consosva has many recognised exemptions, including full-time study, participating in <a href="/corsosva/">Compulsory Service</a>, acting as the primary caregiver of children, and poor health.</p>
<p>Consosva applies to Vekllei citizens or permanent residents aged between 22 and 50.</p>

<p>Education and schooling is an important part of Vekllei society, and its importance is indicated by its dedicated federal <a href="/parliaments/">parliament</a>. It has good outcomes for Vekllei people, and contributes to the country&rsquo;s reputation as among the most literate and learned societies in the world. It has several education institutions of renown, including Vekllei National University and the Commonwealth University of the West Indies. These outcomes have seen the Vekllei model of education replicated overseas, where it is known as the Atlantic Model.</p>
<p>Government education in Vekllei is unusually diverse, and comprises basically all schooling, including school types that would typically be private or independent in other countries. Government, or &lsquo;public&rsquo; schools include religious, independent and alternative schools in addition to standard municipal schools. These alternatives are an effort by the government to anticipate cultural preferences, such as operating Christian or Islamic schools in religious <a href="/republics/">republics</a>. Nonetheless, schools in Vekllei are co-educational with very few exceptions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Education is a founding aspect of the 4th Commonwealth and is to be reaffirmed constantly and faithfully by all Parliaments and public servants, and to this end is to be provided for as a highest priority of the new Parliament.</p>

  Atlantic Model of Education
  <a class="anchor" href="#atlantic-model-of-education">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The <em>Atlantic Model</em> is the colloquial name for the Vekllei public education system. It is a hybridised model incorporating different influences, including progressive and Montessori methods. The Atlantic Model places greater emphasis on personal responsibility, constructivist learning and hobbyism. A distinguishing characteristic is its emphasis on synchronous authority, which protects certain student rights but retains the premise of the teacher as a classroom authority.</p>
<p>Although this system incorporates progressive and alternative education methods, its structure deviates from trends common in those movements. Vekllei schools have traditional classrooms, a common <a href="/factbook/society/state/education/#uniform">student uniform</a>, and address teachers by their surname.</p>
<p>The distinguishing characteristics of the Atlantic Model are:</p>
<blockquote class="note ">
  <span class="text"><ul>
<li>Mixed-age classrooms, mostly comprising an age difference of three years</li>
<li>Emphasis of cleanliness, ordered spaces and natural light</li>
<li>Democratic or student-led topics and activities</li>
<li>Emphasis of personal responsibility, improvement, and discipline</li>
<li>Free time for work and play</li>
<li>Emphasis on clubs, hobbies and extracurricular activities</li>
<li>Shared burdens like cleaning and cooking</li>
<li>Short classroom periods broken up by changes in location and subject</li>
<li>Tracked subject streams</li>
<li>Activities to improve school spirit and civic identity</li>

<p>Education in Vekllei has no fees, by nature of the <em>commons</em>, including at the secondary and tertiary level. It is funded and equipped by the <a class="slink"  style="color: var(--color-education); background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-education) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/society/state/government/parliaments/education/"><span class="fi fi-min-education fis"></span> Education Parliament</a>, which also establishes and supports the national curriculum.</p>
<p>There are many different types of school in Vekllei, but all are government-funded and adhere to the compulsory curriculum outlined by the Education Secretary. The national education uniform is compulsory for all students at both public and independent schools, and is voluntary at universities.</p>

<p>State schools (also <em>central</em> or <em>district schools</em>) are administered and funded directly by a <a href="/republics/">constituent republic</a> through the <a class="slink"  style="color: var(--color-education); background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-education) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/society/state/government/parliaments/education/"><span class="fi fi-min-education fis"></span> Education Parliament</a>, and are common in cities and some high-density city-states. They are traditionally larger and better equipped, and usually provide for both primary and secondary schooling. In certain republics, state schools are also district colleges, meaning they serve students from <a href="/factbook/society/state/education/#preparatory-school">Prep</a> to Year 12 or 13.</p>

<p>Community schools (also <em>local schools</em>) are usually administered by a <a href="/municipalities/">municipality</a>, and are usually smaller than state schools. Although some community schools may combine primary and secondary schooling, most serve only primary education. Community schools may also refer to village schools, or community-run schools in the localist Vekllei tradition.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Studio & Technical Schools</summary>
<p>Studio and technical schools typically refer to secondary schools that specialise in arts or vocational curriculums, as a means to fast-track gifted learning. These schools may offer boarding, as only a few studio and technical schools exist across the Commonwealth and smaller republics may send their students overseas to study there.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Faith Schools</summary>
<p>Faith schools in Vekllei are affiliated with an approved religious organisation. The curriculum of faith schools have a religious character, usually Jewish or Roman Catholic. Faith schools are still required to adhere to the <a href="/factbook/society/state/education/#curriculum">Commonwealth curriculum</a> as a minimum education standard. Faith Schools are also an exception to the universal coeducational system of the Commonwealth, since two schools in Oslola and one in the Kalina Isles are single-sex boarding schools.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Boarding Schools</summary>
<p>Vekllei offers a handful of boarding schools, which are usually specialised institutions that may operate as orphanages or for international students. Some Vekllei boarding schools include aspects of democratic education.</p>

<p>Vekllei people are enrolled in 9 years of compulsory education. In addition, 3 years of pre-school and 3 years of senior secondary schooling are available but not compulsory.</p>
<p>Compared to schooling overseas, Vekllei education places significant value on well-roundedness and practicable household and technical skills, as well as social behaviour. Subject-based streams for specialised learning are common, but the basic compulsory Vekllei curriculum emphasises non-academic subjects and structures pre-tertiary subjects as electives. Reinforcement and learning are lead by positive rather than negative means.</p>

<p>Vekllei has a strong tradition of school clubs and social organisations, and these are considered essential aspects of Vekllei education. Clubs and associations are usually organised by student leadership, and offer opportunities in industry and tertiary study.</p>
<p>Compulsory and tertiary education is free for all Vekllei people, permanent residents and foreign workers. Homeschooling is illegal except by those holding a teaching certificate, and is supervised by a local school which issues the child&rsquo;s diploma. In this context, homeschooling is almost nonexistent in the Commonwealth. About 15% of the Commonwealth Budget is allocated towards education.</p>

<p>Vekllei offers preschooling from ages 3 onwards. Garden School, or kindergarten, is for 3 &amp; 4 year-olds in Vekllei, and assists with the transition from home to school, followed by preparatory school, or &lsquo;prep&rsquo;, which is the first year of compulsory primary education.</p>
<p>Vekllei primary education consists of 7 years, starting with <a href="/factbook/society/state/education/#preparatory-school">Prep</a> at ages 5-6 and concluding with Year 6 at age 12. Secondary education lasts from years 7-12, and study until year 10 is compulsory.</p>

<p>The Commonwealth invests heavily in tertiary education as both a social good and a product marketable overseas. Vekllei universities rank highly abroad, and education as a service is a major export of Vekllei, and contributes to Vekllei&rsquo;s reputation as an international capital of finance and skilled labour.</p>
<p>Universities in Vekllei offer places to students who have completed their Education Award and satisfy the prerequisites for their subject. These requirements differ between subjects, and usually include an interview with the admissions board.</p>
<p>In order to study abroad, Vekllei students must be sponsored by a foreigner, receive a partial scholarship from an overseas university, or receive funding from their tertiary place of study. About one in four Vekllei students study overseas for some period of time.</p>

<p>All schools in Vekllei share a common student uniform, which can also be worn by teachers and at university. The basic components are universal, but makes no requirements about hair, piercings or makeup. In addition, the basic uniform is often heavily accessorised with cultural elements approved by the school. These include elements like hats, belts, overskirt pleats, clothing items and armbands, but these are added to the existing uniform and do not typically modify the base components.</p>

  <span class="text"><strong>Espionage</strong> is a considerable strength of the 4th Commonwealth, while also incurring a growing cost. Its assertive and risky operations, some of which have ended in catastrophe, inflict considerable damage on its image abroad, and isolate it from European and American powers. But this assertiveness has also built a fearsome, modern and sprawling intelligence network that meets or surpasses even that of much greater superpowers. Unsentimental, unideological and unflinching, espionage in Vekllei is conducted constantly and vigorously with the blessing &ndash; or at least willing blindness &ndash; of the state.</span>
</blockquote>

<p>Espionage in Vekllei is considered the &lsquo;first thorn&rsquo; of &lsquo;assertive defence&rsquo; practiced by the 4th Commonwealth. It is maintained offensively, as operations, and defensively as counterintelligence. The means by which it does are a source of endless contention in Commonwealth parliaments, the Vekllei public and foreign governments,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> but since independence in 2015 espionage has been conducted much the same &ndash; and so can be assumed to be achieving strategic goals.</p>
<p>Overseas strategic and industrial espionage primarily falls under the control of the Commonwealth National Intelligence Directorate, usually called <a class="slink"  style="color: var(--color-security); background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-security) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/society/state/government/parliaments/security/noshem/"><span class="fi fi-min-noshem fis"></span> Noshem</a>, which maintains several subordinate bureaus organised regionally.</p>
<p>Current intelligence doctrine values &lsquo;signal operations&rsquo; &ndash; visible strategic actions that &lsquo;signal&rsquo; messages to public enemies of the Commonwealth state, and maintaining plausible deniability. The line between civilian and military intelligence operations is not always clear, and Noshem is implicated in assassinations and executions of state enemies overseas. The Vekllei intelligence community is known to recruit ideological and nationalist sympathisers to perform actions on behalf of the state, and to this end has among the largest networks of informants of any espionage ring in the world.</p>

<p>Noshem,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> the traditional name for the <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/commonwealth/security/#national-intelligence-directorate">National Intelligence Directorate</a> is the secret service of the Commonwealth and is responsible for most of its overseas espionage. It has a legendary reputation for the size and quality of its informants network, and is highly feared because of its history of ruthlessness, including extrajudicial assassinations and executions. Plausible deniability makes it difficult to tell how much of its work is sanctioned by parliaments or acted out by individual Vekllei people, and the organisation generates considerable controversy. Noshem has had several publicised tactical successes as well as failures, and is considered a critical aspect of Commonwealth security as a &lsquo;jewelled sabre&rsquo; of the non-aligned movement.</p>
<p>Noshem operates 40 outlines across 6 bureaus, which are organised regionally and contain semiautonomous command and logistics elements.</p>
<h3 id="security-directorates">
  Security Directorates
  <a class="anchor" href="#security-directorates">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Cosevac (POSEC) and Vosevisi (SESEC) are the Security Directorates of the Public and State respectively. Vosevisi processes some Noshem material, and its subordinate <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/commonwealth/security/#state-secrets-office">State Secrets Office</a> is also responsible for maintaining security controls and classifications. Although they collect intelligence internally, most espionage is conducted overseas by <a href="/factbook/society/state/espionage/#noshem">Noshem</a>.</p>
<h3 id="adsem">
  Adsem
  <a class="anchor" href="#adsem">#</a>

<p>Adsem is the military intelligence department of the Vekllei Armed Forces.

Like the Security Directorates, most of Adsem&rsquo;s espionage is conducted by Noshem. In turn, Adsem supplies much of Noshem&rsquo;s matériel, and many of its elite intelligence units are recruited from military commando and special forces sections. Adsem may also assist in the logistics of Noshem espionage operations.</p>
<h3 id="recruitment">
  Recruitment
  <a class="anchor" href="#recruitment">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Vekllei human intelligence is generally considered superior to that of the CIA, and may even be comparable to the KGB in scope and quality. Human intelligence is the basis of contemporary Vekllei intelligence-gathering, and the intelligence state gathers and processes massive amounts of information on foreign nationals, companies, and governments. It relies on enormous, concentric rings of highly motivated unpaid sympathisers that help Noshem in passing messages, inserting agents and obscuring information.</p>
<p>There are several classes of sympathiser &ndash; some are ideologically motivated in the anarchist or pan-Atlanticist tradition, factions which the Vekllei government is willing to recognise or indulge publicly to stir positive and negative press and distinguish itself from the cold war dichotomy. Others are nationalists who help out of a sense of devotion to Vekllei, since several million Vekllei people fled after the Atomic War. Although many returned in the years after independence, there remains a large Vekllei diaspora throughout the world and especially in the United States and Western Europe, and many members continue to hold a sense of duty towards the country.</p>
<p>This network of sympathisers is aided by Vekllei&rsquo;s postwar internationalism and multiracialism, emphasising political and geographic traits that appeal to young, educated people. Where duty fails, cash often suffices, and tremendous amounts of state funds are siphoned discretely from other Ministerial budgets to fund a network of paid informants. The total number of informants is impossible to know, but is estimated to number tens of thousands across the U.S., U.K., France, Russia, Yugoslavia, China and South-East Asia.</p>

<p>The colloquial turn-of-phrase for the domestic Vekllei economy is &ldquo;functionally moneyless,&rdquo; but the actual mechanisms of the internal Vekllei market is considerably more complex. While the average Vekllei person is insulated from money and money-management, their Commonwealth is a major entrepôt<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and has a reputation as an &ldquo;Atlantic Middleman.&rdquo; Vekllei&rsquo;s facilitation of frictionless free trade, large foreign-exchange reserves and received foreign direct investments have resulted in decades of consistent economic growth, and has cemented its reputation as a financial hub between Europe and the Americas.</p>
<p>Vekllei&rsquo;s history as a trade hub contributes significantly to its perceived neutrality and its reputation as a meeting place for politics and business, and regularly hosts diplomatic missions as a neutral site. It maintains its moneyless primary economy by effectively isolating its primary (<a href="/factbook/society/state/finance/#domestic-markets">domestic</a>) and secondary (<a href="/factbook/society/state/finance/#international-markets">international</a>) markets, which are the reason for its <a href="/factbook/society/state/finance/#currency">twin currencies</a> and its unusual hybrid market system. Because the Vekllei state manages all money as a function of its moneylessness, the international market and foreign trade is strongly characterised by dirigism and fundamentally beholden to the economic management of the <a class="slink"  style="color: var(--color-commerce); background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-commerce) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/society/state/government/ministries/commerce/"><span class="fi fi-min-commerce fis"></span> Ministry of Commerce</a>, which acts as both a financial regulator and investment bank.</p>

</h3>
<p>The Vekllei Domestic Market is the turn-of-phrase for the unmoneyed Vekllei economy, including almost all private and public businesses and the majority of trade conducted by ordinary Vekllei people. It is the primary market of Vekllei. For most Vekllei people, the domestic market is the only one with which they will interact in their lives, except for the occasional holiday overseas. The Domestic Market includes all sectors of the Vekllei economy except state trade apparatuses like <a href="/factbook/society/state/finance/#international-markets">VKIM</a>.</p>
<p>While the participatory nature of the Domestic Market affects its gross productivity, it is regarded as free, innovative and dynamic. It has a skilled workforce benefitted by a robust education system and a high quality of life. About 40% of Vekllei people were born overseas, and some 15% of the Vekllei workforce remain foreign workers. Foreign workers, unlike domestic ones, are remunerated unless residing under an immigration visa.</p>

  Industrial Markets

<p>Vekllei Industrial Markets are distinguished by their ability to trade in both the moneyless <a href="/factbook/society/state/finance/#domestic-markets">Domestic Market</a> and the <a href="/factbook/society/state/finance/#international-markets">VKIM</a>. There are two kinds of industrial firm in Vekllei:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Senrouive</strong>: private enterprises</li>
<li><strong>Venrouive</strong>: public enterprises with membership in an industrial <a href="/bureaus/">bureau</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Venrouive</em> (also known as public companies in Vekllei) are enterprises beholden to <a href="/bureaus/">industrial bureaus</a>, which are collections of companies with close relations and hold membership in a shared industrial council. Venrouive businesses are characterised by large-scale enterprises, some of which may be state-owned, that hold considerable power over a market. In some cases, a bureau may monopolise a market, as in the case of the Vekllei telecommunications industry.</p>
<p>Both senrouive and venrouive companies may participate in the international market, but only bureaus (and by extension, participating venrouive companies) may trade directly with overseas governments and enterprises.</p>

<p>The Vekllei International Market (VKIM) is an organisation that controls the capital, commodities and securities markets of Vekllei. VKIM is maintained by the <a class="slink"  style="color: var(--color-commerce); background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-commerce) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/society/state/government/ministries/commerce/"><span class="fi fi-min-commerce fis"></span> Ministry of Commerce</a> as a mechanism for foreign investors and merchants to interact with the isolated, unmoneyed Vekllei domestic market. The international market includes a commodities exchange, derivatives marketplace and other structured financial products that facilitate foreign activity in the Vekllei economy and raise foreign capital for the national liquid currency reserves. VKIM uses the Vekllei Composite Index as a measure of the Vekllei economy, which measures both commodity value and productivity.</p>
<p>The International Market is the means by which the capital account<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> of the Commonwealth Government implements its long-standing macroeconomic interest in foreign investment and soft power. The reinvestment of capital surplus in the <a href="/factbook/society/state/finance/#currency">Vekllei currencies</a> serves as a form of sterilisation and capital control, controlled directly by the central <a class="slink" style="color: rgb(240, 93, 136); background: color-mix(in srgb, rgb(240, 93, 136) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/society/industry/state/commonwealth-bank/"><span class="fi fi-min-combank fis"></span> Commonwealth Bank</a>.

</blockquote>

<p>Vekllei has two currencies that are more or less opposed in their use as money, known as the twin crowns system. The Vekllei Crown (❦VK) is a gold-backed, fixed-rate deflationary currency used primarily as a wealth reserve, and the Government Crown (✾AK) is a fiat, floating-exchange currency used for foreign investment and trade. This system preserves the isolation of the Vekllei primary economy, which is moneyless, while insulating state investments from shocks and from having to burn liquidity to maintain its exchange rate.</p>
<p>Together, the twin crowns allow for the Vekllei state to retain unprecedented control over its financial system while securing a mechanism for foreign investment and growth.</p>
<ul>
<li>The domestic market is autarkic and does not have free capital exchange, allowing it to maintain its fixed price and independent monetary policy</li>
<li>The international market is open and has free capital exchange, facilitated by ✾AK floating exchange price with policy independence maintained by capital controls from the <a class="slink"  style="color: var(--color-commerce); background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-commerce) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/society/state/government/ministries/commerce/"><span class="fi fi-min-commerce fis"></span> Ministry of Commerce</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a variety of political and economic reasons, the Vekllei Commonwealth state aims to be self-sufficient. The twin crowns system provides a means to isolate its productive primary economy while also allowing foreign money controlled access to it. The unmoneyed primary economy remains a popular investment for its stability.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> As capital controls have broken down in the mid-2030s, Vekllei&rsquo;s current macroeconomic policy exists as a &ldquo;third way&rdquo; between closed autarky and recent trends towards an open economic international market.</p>

It is minted by the  as a souvenir in the tradition of Vekllei <em>medals</em>,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> but is not otherwise used by Vekllei people as money or transacted in day-to-day life. It is primarily a deflationary currency store backed by gold, and to which each Vekllei citizen is entitled an equal share in emigration. It is not able to be used on the <a href="/factbook/society/state/finance/#international-markets">VKIM</a> directly, but can be purchased as a <a href="/factbook/society/state/finance/#white-bonds">White Bond</a> as a speculative instrument. It is also used in some cases as a mechanism for trade with individuals abroad, mostly by smaller banks looking to broker purchases of goods or services unavailable in Vekllei.</p>

<p>The <em>Government/Commonwealth Kroner</em> (also the <em>Atlantic Kroner</em> or <em>Crown</em>) is a twin currency used primarily by the state to insure financial instruments like bonds as well as for converting and placing foreign investments and currency. The Government Crown operates on a floating exchange rate as a fiat currency tradeable in the <a href="/factbook/society/state/finance/#international-markets">VKIM</a> and a means for overseas actions in the Vekllei economy.</p>
<p>The ✾AK is not minted as it does not resemble a conventional currency, and exists only in bonds, state certificates, and as a metric for some commodity money. It has a strong reputation as a hard currency because of the ✾AK&rsquo;s relative security and reliability, backed by powerful domestic institutions.</p>

<p>Unlike in other countries, the socialisation of banking in Vekllei also saw the broad exclusion of retail investors and savings banking, effectively halting money exchange in the domestic market and institutionalising the Vekllei banking system. Today, most Vekllei banks are institutional and deal primarily with the secondary speculative markets like <a href="/factbook/society/state/finance/#international-markets">VKIM</a>, or provide lending and contracts for new businesses in the <a href="/factbook/society/state/finance/#industrial-markets">industrial market</a>.</p>

<p>The Bank of Vekllei (also <em>Labour Bank of Vekllei</em> and <em>Old Lady</em>) is Vekllei&rsquo;s central bank with a constitutionally-granted monopoly on the financial mechanisms of the Commonwealth, with nearly all Commonwealth banking firms subordinated to its organisation.

<p>Despite the functional moneylessness of the Commonwealth, banks do facilitate financial transactions with the common Vekllei person. Aside from its policy features (like holiday allowances and emigration stipends), most trade arrangements operate in the bank system, usually through the <em>Sisterbank</em>. Sisterbank (formally the <em>Petty Bank of Vekllei</em>) is a merchant bank that specialises in industrial brokerage, allowing small businesses to trade with others and stimulate economic activity. Vekllei persons looking to start a restaurant, workshop or store generally do so through the Sisterbank, which assigns a bank agent and enters the business in its internal market ledger. Not all small business in Vekllei is conducted through the an agent, but certain types of industries (particularly businesses involved in manufacturing) are almost all banked with Sisterbank.</p>
<p>In addition to government banks, money bureaus (also <em>Money Unions</em>) are a form of cooperative credit union premised on private business associations and securitised lending, and are common in Vekllei agriculture.</p>

<p><strong>Property</strong> in <a class="slink"  style="color: var(--color-vekllei); background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-vekllei) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/world/vekllei/"><span class="fi fi-com"></span> Vekllei</a> is not just a legal right but a foundation of their society. They have a completely new mode of living, without direct precedence or comparison, and the entitlement of ordinary people to land is a basic feature of their vision of a more productive and equitable society.</p>
<p>Property is the foundation of much of Vekllei life and culture. Almost all other aspects of their society flow on naturally from their assumptions about the core treatment of land and who may live there and work it.</p>
<p>Property is also the basic unit of the city, and most Vekllei people now live in cities. These are not just arrangements of buildings but societies in motion, and in this organic fashion can express living ideas. Vekllei is most importantly a democracy, and so its cities should be democratic. For that to happen, its basic unit, property, should be democratic too.</p>
<blockquote class="note panel">
  <span class="text"><p><strong>Core Principles of Property</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Property is an entitlement of all people in Vekllei</li>
<li>Use and stewardship of property gives dignity and independence</li>
<li>There should be public ownership of public needs, and private ownership of private needs</li>
<li>There is no realtor except the <a href="/municipalities/">municipality</a>, and the architect is the agent of the municipality</li>
<li>Beauty is a form of dignity and should be accessible to ordinary people</li>
<li>Democracy is as much a way of living as it is a form of government</li>
</ul></span>
</blockquote>

<p>These facts refer specifically to the role of property and housing, but also apply across society in all aspects of Vekllei life. There are clear provisions for the dignity and independence of the individual while acknowledging the importance of social coordination for man and machine, which demonstrates the centrality of property to Vekllei society.</p>
<p>Rather than a straightforward legal contract, land ownership in Vekllei is an arena of competing claims between three agents. Land can and does own itself, and ownership is a contract with that land. As such, while a resident and steward of a plot of land may have <em>de facto</em> ownership, that claim has to be qualified in court against competing agents.</p>
<blockquote class="note panel">
  <span class="text"><p><strong>Claim Agents in Vekllei</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Land</strong> &ndash; Land owns itself, and has its interests extrapolated by an advocate independent from the Public or Steward.</li>
<li><strong>The Public</strong> &ndash; The community and its advocate, the state. Most often, the municipality is the representative of the state.</li>
<li><strong>The Steward</strong> &ndash; The resident and steward of the land, who may live or work there.</li>
</ul></span>
</blockquote>

<p>In litigating ownership, the claims of each party are weighed against each other to produce a legal consensus, though that consensus may only be partial or non-binding. Ownership is not a binary legal concept and so while the Steward may have the strongest claim to ownership, that fact does not force total concession of the other agents. In most cases, all three agents have some rights and consequently some measure of claim.</p>
<p>Claims are strengthened by the amount of labour or time an agent has spent with the land, historical context, familial and sentimental values, public benefit, improvements made by the agent, and the planning of the community.</p>
<!--<blockquote class="note panel">
  <span class="text"><strong>Housing</strong> in Vekllei is socialised in the Georgist tradition. It is a recognition that all wealth lies in land, the resources beneath it, and the people that work it. In this sense, housing in Vekllei is just as radical and striking as its moneylessness.</span>
</blockquote>


All real estate in Vekllei is negotiated, purchased and leased at a [municipal](/municipalities/) level. This system depends heavily on stewardship as a factor of ownership. Most free homes are rented on an open market and are awarded via an interview process with the municipality, though there are many exceptions. In general, the more time a resident spends working a property, the more powerful their claim to ownership becomes. In this sense, multigenerational family homes are nearly impossible to challenge in the delicture courts.

As part of [Vekllei metaphysics](/metaphysics/), land has rights and owns itself. Human ownership is foremost a contract with the land, and the municipality is positioned as an intermediary. In practice, land ownership is portioned between different agents based on their relationship with the property. The municipality may retain a monopoly on real estate, but most Vekllei people own their residences. All residences are designed by architects, who are an essential agent of the municipality in Vekllei.

Real estate is also used as [compensation](/news/essays/moneylessness/#why-do-vekllei-people-work). Doctors are usually housed close to their place of work in homes built for that purpose. Tenancy in Vekllei is generally of this type, where homes are tied to employment. In the Vekllei delicture system, longtime employees gradually wrest ownership away from the municipality, and homes are commonly gifted after ten or fifteen years of service.-->]]>

<p>There are a few criteria separating Polisa from regular city councils. They are generally self-sufficient, and include surrounding areas capable of agriculture and industry. They also retain their own lower courts, and have a strengthened local government consisting of a popular assembly (the Municipal Assembly) and Ecclesia &ndash; special-purpose councils of important civic citizens and industrial representatives.</p>

<p><strong>Work Action Groups</strong> are temporary volunteer organisations formed (or <em>raised</em>) for specific objectives. Although they are often raised and equipped by the <a class="slink"  style="color: var(--color-labour); background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-labour) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/society/state/government/ministries/labour/"><span class="fi fi-min-labour fis"></span> Ministry of Labour</a>, they are strictly participatory and organised locally.</p>
<p>The groups, known as WAGs, are formed by a general call for volunteers in municipal newspapers and government gazettes. They may also be announced in workplaces and schools, depending on the task. They are an expression of <a class="slink"  style="color: var(--color-vekllei); background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-vekllei) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/world/vekllei/"><span class="fi fi-com"></span> Vekllei</a> volunteerism and solidarity, and participation can be competitive. Once established, participants are relieved of duties for work, school and compulsory service for up to three months, which may be extended with permission of the labour ministry.</p>
<p>WAGs are most often assembled in response to, rather than anticipation of, an event or crisis. Common examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emergency municipal repairs (e.g. to repair a school roof)</li>
<li>Charity and relief for communities under hardship</li>
<li>A natural disaster in Vekllei or overseas</li>
<li>An emerging health crisis</li>
<li>Assistance for essential tasks (e.g. relieving construction or emergency crews)</li>
</ul>
<p>WAGs are commonplace in Vekllei society and one of the purer expressions of the culture of mutual obligation in their communities. Volunteers are highly respected, and participation (known as being &ldquo;on the WAG&rdquo;) can benefit social standing and opportunities for employment. Any Vekllei person can petition the creation of a Work Action Group by submitting a notice to the <a class="slink"  style="color: var(--color-labour); background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-labour) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/society/state/government/ministries/labour/"><span class="fi fi-min-labour fis"></span> Ministry of Labour</a>, or their municipality.</p>
