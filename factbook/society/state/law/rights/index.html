It supports constitutional values of democracy, equality and freedom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Vekllei Commonwealth (the Commonwealth) must maintain, defend, promote and fulfil these rights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Vekllei person (the Citizen) has obligations to maintain, defend, promote and fulfil these rights as determined by law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These rights are inviolable where not subject to the limitations contained or referred to in section 30, or elsewhere in the <a href="/constitution/">Vekllei Constitution</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Application of rights</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The political concept of civil rights applies to all law, and binds the legislature, the executive, the judiciary and all federal, commonwealth, republican and municipal agents of the country, thereafter recognised as &lsquo;Vekllei&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Commonwealth&rsquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The political concept of civil rights also binds and entitles a natural or a juristic person to the extent that a right is applicable considering the nature of the right and its obligations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When applying a provision of the universal civil rights to a natural or juristic person in terms of subsection (2.2), a court ­</p>
<ol>
<li>must apply or develop the common law to the extent that legislation does not give effect to a universal civil right; and</li>
