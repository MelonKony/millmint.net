	  <description>❖ For common questions about me or my work, please visit the FAQ.   Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Hobart. I&amp;rsquo;m an Australian illustrator and writer living and working in Tasmania. I like machines, midcentury architecture and Tasmania. I studied as a journalist, but now work in illustration full-time.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently trying to learn how to cook. I walk most afternoons around my home town, which inspires a lot of how Vekllei looks and feels.</description>

The lake was near where Ayn’s parents lived, and they sailed across it on a wooden boat her father had made nearly 50 years before. Time was cyclical out here; it folded in on itself.

	  <description>❖ Note from the Editor This thesis was completed in partial fulfillment of Bachelor of Media (Honours). It remains a good testament to my love of Ghibli. It was originally submitted in October 2020 and published in December 2020.   Abstract T his thesis looks to argue for the value of spatiality in several films of the Studio Ghibli franchise in Japan. Literary space, much like the cartography of the real world, helps map meaning and locate the human body in the contemporary, postmodern displacement of old constructions.</description>

Its geography was ancient and violent, strikingly barren and brutally volcanic. Why visit Europa? It was alien enough here.

	  <description>߷ This article is about a borough of Vekllei   Gigayeh had beautiful empty beaches, littered with icebergs that caught the light like jewels, but Tzipora couldn’t swim and the water was freezing. They could have enjoyed café food in the sun, but Cobian’s regimented home life had left her incapable of eating outside of her designated meals, and Tzipora could only drink so much coffee. Instead, most of these afternoons, they found themselves sitting on the ocean promenade, watching a handful of locals go about their business as they counted the minutes.</description>

Just a short update on where I’m at as we pass mid-month. I’ve pushed a couple of things back a day or two to finish a very cool/special post. You’ll see it on the reddit soon — it’ll be a really nice painting, and nothing like I’ve ever done before. Before the weekend.
I was hesitant to promise a timeframe for the comic draft, and for good reason.</description>

The Vekllei Person W hat good is more writing about theories and the methodology of country-constructs? More importantly — how is it authentically convincing to the person who has lived their entire lives immersed in their own ways of living? Vekllei does not use money — the purpose of these notes are to demonstrate how such a thing works, immersing Vekllei’s participatory economy in a human lens, and articulate the motivations, biases and assumptions of the average working Vekllei person.</description>

	  <description>People across the world are very excited by the possibilities and emerging styles in new synthetic materials, including polyester, plastic, and new-nylon. In keeping with her meticulous and mildly neurotic character, Tzipora cannot stand synthetic fibres and refuses wear anything that isn&amp;rsquo;t soft, loose-fitting and hand-washable.
Like most metrics kept in her head, it&amp;rsquo;s largely arbitrary and fluctuates depending on the visibility of materials and her awareness of it, but does invariably inform her sense of fashion, leaving her conservative and old-fashioned in appearance as her peers take on increasingly colourful (and avant garde) styles made possible by a materials revolution.</description>

	  <description>Tzipora hated sleeping by herself. It wasn’t just anxiety from America, either — she’d spent half her life in dorms and didn’t much like the silence of a quiet room. When she first moved in with Baron, she would lie in her improvised bed for hours and listen to the ringing in her ears. She was most paranoid, most neurotic alone with her thoughts, with her memory wandering through everything she’d said and done.</description>

	  <description>The years that were supposed to be Tzipora’s finest were falling apart. She was fourteen, out of money and out of options. Her tuition laboured on, paid in advance, but there was nothing left over for her. Her mother didn’t send money or letters anymore. So Tzipora lived on the free dinners provided by the Sisters of Charity and gifts from people who pitied her, mostly wealthy migrants associated with the church.</description>

A New Style of Utopia I write introspectively about the project sometimes, as a means by which I consider what I&amp;rsquo;m doing and where my unconscious is leading me with this project.

This is your monthly update for the Petticoat Project.
There’s a new post up on the subreddit and a new article up on the website — a big one, about Vekllei, although it’s missing a history and culture section. Those are coming soon.
I won’t be mucking around on the website forever — trust me, I have no intention of abandoning my traditional post format for dry wiki articles — but it makes good infrastructure, and good infrastructure allows for growth and it also helps support new projects, like the comic.</description>

	  <description>.gt-container { display: none; }  Overview ߷ This article is about Vekllei society  Vekllei is positioned uniquely between the anarchy and control. This article looks at its government, which facilitates and manages these competing instincts. As the representative of the Vekllei state, and the body of its human interests, the Vekllei Government is second only to the Sovereign in its authority over Vekllei society.  T he Government of Vekllei refers to both the Administration of the Interior of the Vekllei Home Islands and the international governing body of the Vekllei Commonwealth.</description>

	  <description>❖ Note from the Editor This article was originally published in October 2019. This article was written shortly after my return from Hong Kong, where I got caught up in the pro-democracy protests and is a broad response to Australian coverage of the ongoing events.  H ong Kong is a loud, bustling jewel of a city. It is perhaps my favourite city in the world. On sweltering days, what sounds like raindrops smack the pavement as hundreds of air-conditioning units drip liquid into the streets below.</description>

A comic; a new website; new friends — June was a good month. The posts this month departed from the slice-of-life conventions of May, reintroducing maps and infographics to the project. This is a good change!</description>

	  <description>1. Overview ߷ This article is about Vekllei  The language of Vekllei is an important part of the project. Utopianism cascades through every part of society, and rethinking communication is a foundational part of that instinct. In this article, we look at what makes Vekllei as a language special, and give insight into how these Atlantic people communicate with each other.   What is the worth of the worthless?</description>

	  <description>.gt-container { display: none; }  Overview ߷ This article is about Vekllei society  This article discusses one of the most important and visible organisations in everyday Vekllei life: Vekllei National Rail. Vekllei is criss-crossed by hundreds of different rail lines of various gauges, grades, and purposes. In fact, it runs many lines at a total loss, often under capacity. To understand these inefficiencies is to understand why the National Rail exists, and to some extent, how Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s state assets and powerful bureaus shape life in the country today.</description>

	  <description>1. Overview ߷ This article is about Vekllei  Upen is the nondenominational animistic spiritualism of Vekllei. It is both an organised religious belief system and a decentralised local animism, localised regionally across the Home Islands and beyond. As a basis for Vekllei metaphysics and general belief systems, Upen is a central part of Vekllei cultural identity and informs most parts of life at all levels in the country.  U pen is the animistic, nondenominational dominant and historical religion of Vekllei.</description>

	  <description>❖ Note from the Editor This article was originally published in October 2019. It offers an analysis of Evelyn Waugh&amp;rsquo;s Handful of Dust through an anti-utopian prism.  Waugh’s Handful of Dust as Anti-Utopia W augh&amp;rsquo;s A Handful of Dust has remarkable topography. The word can be extrapolated in this case in several ways; for one, the book is occupied by worldly, secular affairs, inextricably bound to a particular cultural landscape and absence of metaphysic.</description>

There are fewer posts this month — and aside from Vekllei’s Race for Inefficiency, they’ve all been pretty tepid stuff. There’s good reason for that, and hopefully we’ll be back to regular production next month. And the postcards are currently making their way around the world — how exciting!</description>

The first chapter of the comic is sketched. You will see it on Monday (about two days from this message). It won&amp;rsquo;t be inked but it&amp;rsquo;ll give you a very good idea of what the final chapter will look like at the end of the month. I look forward to reading your feedback, since it&amp;rsquo;s my first try at this sort of thing (well, minus the dozens of concepts trashed over the previous few months).</description>

 You guys voted! Looks like our next themed ‘week’ (maybe fortnight) is Ocean Week. Great choice, lots of cool concepts coming. Mail Week (fortnight) has been a lot of fun, but it’s almost done.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s been a little while since my last direct communiqué. I laid off these for a bit, since I realised you probably didn&amp;rsquo;t need to have your inbox full of blog posts and delay announcements from me. Time better spent drawing I reckon.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had a couple things going on in my personal life, so I&amp;rsquo;ve had to put some of my wilder ambitions on hold for a bit.</description>

This was a hard month, evidenced in part by the smaller number of posts. Personal problems and some bad news are enough to derail plans, I’m afraid, and so other things had to take their place. November saw an increase in articles on MillMint.net and polish to the site, a whole lot of little sketches, as well as plans for a Patreon milestone reward and some private work on the comic.</description>

	  <description>❖ Note from the Editor This article was originally published in December 2018. Yes, it’s painfully self-concerned and a little difficult to read back, but for newcomers to the project you might find some “obvious truths” about Vekllei you have not yet encountered.  I did not come to Tokyo to find a reference for the Petticoat Project, because utopia does not exist there for me. In fact, by nearly every Vekllei metric, Tokyo is positively dystopian — a consumer paradise of the crushing, isolating modernity Vekllei is supposed to escape.</description>

	  <description>The base unit of Vekllei society are municipalities, called municipolis in their language. They occupy a uniquely intimate presence in Vekllei life as an unusual body of public affairs. Unlike other state bodies in Vekllei, which function similar to their overseas counterparts, local municipalities supersede their conventional definition as mere &amp;lsquo;local governments&amp;rsquo; and are considerably more essential to the wellbeing of Vekllei communities.
In Vekllei, the word municipolis refers to</description>

	  <description>Merce was one of seven sisters but she didn’t know it. Like many Vekllei people in young adulthood, her parents were born overseas, and so her Spanish heritage was somewhat obscured.
Growing up in postwar Vekllei, you develop an unusual esprit de corps which supersedes almost everything about you — a civic mission to establish a place in the world regardless of your prior circumstance or heritage. This well-intentioned internationalism cut both ways; you were not much judged about where you came from, but you also did not talk much about where you came from.</description>

Catch the tram home. Walk if the weather is &amp;lsquo;interesting&amp;rsquo; (dramatic). Unlock the apartment and exchange her shoes for sandals. Bring in the bedding airing in the backyard and say hello to the stripy stray cat. Put away her books and rinse her lunchbox.

The public markets are very public — centralised, controlled, documented and secure. The private markets are very private — anarchic, wide-ranging, interpersonal and unseen. Police in Vekllei work in both of these spaces, maintaining the peace and navigating their unique criminal topography.</description>

	  <description>❖ Welcome to 2022, year of Vekllei. Here&amp;rsquo;s to a great year of art, dreams and love.  Tzipora spent the lunar solstice of 2067 with Ayn and Baron on one of the warm steam lakes of Flous. The lake was near where Ayn&amp;rsquo;s parents lived, and they sailed across it on a wooden boat her father had made nearly 50 years before. Time was cyclical out here; it folded in on itself.</description>

	  <description>Archived from the original article here   a.book-btn:hover { filter: brightness(85%); }  Cobian was a complicated person. When Tzipora met her, she was burdened by her parents and wracked by small faults that glinted openly at the other girls in the school halls. She was insecure, out of touch, a little childish, and desperate to be liked. Tzipora was a fair bit like her, but carried those traits in different ways.</description>

Tzipora had regarded her politely but distantly for a while after Moise started dating her in 10th grade. It was an awkward thing. Tzipora was not quite sure how to strike up a conversation — maybe she was a little insecure.
Coretti was an Afro-Russian, but had lived in Vekllei since she was six.</description>

They had come over after the troubles in Tel Aviv and their persecution in the Dallas States. She had seen that; that was where she learned of her own history. It was not through faith or practice or family that she had discovered her Jewishness, but persecution — the unfolding story of all Ashkenazim.</description>

That’s actually what they were called, in the pidgin of Vekllei ideology — the tenets of petticoat-style socialism were called blossoms.
Vekllei maintains it is not ideological; it is in fact very ideological — you are looking at a state that is afraid of its skeleton.</description>

Most often, its duties are conventional — search and rescue, law enforcement, and maritime patrols across Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s territorial waters and exclusive economic zone.</description>

Each time the city fell, another company of Chinese burrowed themselves into the city, and each time it took about two months to drive them back into the sea. This was mostly done by the KMT and the Americans, who had heavy equipment. In Taiwan’s mountainous interior, a rainbow coalition of former colonies, indentured states and free-world ideologues fought brutally against the invasion of 2045.</description>

	  <description>Archived from the original article here   a.book-btn:hover { filter: brightness(85%); }  Vekllei is growing; it was an age of wonder. But it was still old enough to smell like wood smoke on cold days, when a thick mist travelled down from the highlands, filling and overflowing the valleys between glaciers, gentle and cool, leaving dew upon you. This is Vekllei; city of water and light.
Wet weather was Tzipora’s favourite because it made Vekllei feel like home.</description>

	  <description>Archived from the original article here   a.book-btn:hover { filter: brightness(85%); }  Vekllei is the last great utopia of the world, defying attempts to predict the curve of progress and standing alone in its radical embrace of moneylessness and the goodness of people. This is what it looks like; here are its streets; its cities and villages.
A map lays a framework to conceptualise what the lives of these people might look like.</description>

What started out as a nasty habit in California’s decaying boarding school system eventually became a social medicine in the severe anxiety of her school years in Vekllei. She used her packs strategically, afraid of building a dependence that would dilute nicotine’s effects on her frayed nerves.</description>

Vekllei people are, by any metric, exquisite documentarians. Fifty years ago, all news reporting was subject to censor by the insecure Atlantic Junta.</description>

	  <description>Archived from the original article here   a.book-btn:hover { filter: brightness(85%); }  Children of the children of the bomb — a generation of war-babies born in peacetime. That was how they thought of themselves. Their grandparents and great-grandparents had lived through the war and the occupation, and so they had inherited the burden of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s future as a country of long-sufferers, visionaries, and dispossessed.
Some Marxist continental intellectual had said something a half-century ago about the right way to teach children, and the idea had probably caught the ear of some commissar of the Vekllei interim government, who perhaps passed it along to some bureaucrat rebuilding the government schools.</description>

After school, heading west on the trains and picking up work as she found it, she wore whatever she could afford.
Up until her first steps inside the Cozetti Department Store in Vekllei, clothing was for gazing, not for being gazed at.</description>

In a country without money, you can think of it as the payroll of every Vekllei person — the body responsible for the welfare of Vekllei people.
Although Vekllei does not use money domestically, the country is bound by the Floral Constitution, the Dignity in Employment Act 2016,and the Fair Work Act 2022 to provide regular, measurable increases in the standard of living for Vekllei people.</description>

	  <description>Archived from the original article here   a.book-btn:hover { filter: brightness(85%); }  ❖ This essay was published on millmint.net. Read it here.  I write introspectively about the project sometimes, as a means by which I consider what I&amp;rsquo;m doing and where my unconscious is leading me with this project. I have the instinct of someone who is over-educated and self-obsessed; someone who went to university, fell for the farce of serious media criticism, and failed to see that all media theorists are basically freaks.</description>

	  <description>Archived from the original article here   a.book-btn:hover { filter: brightness(85%); }  Where Tzipora lived in Lola, most people remained of the working class well into the utopian period. Despite their equitable access to the fruits of the country, their housing was poorer and their problems generational. Alcoholism was very common; many of them were veterans of the War in Taiwan. Others were in great pain from their early work in the postwar years, their bodies broken by the demons of manual labour.</description>

	  <description>Archived from the original article here   a.book-btn:hover { filter: brightness(85%); }  There was not much different about one spirit than another. Foreigners mistook Upen, the animism of Vekllei, for environmentalism — that was not the case at all. Landscapes changed, and so did the things that lived in them.
Of course, humans are sentimental creatures, and they become attached to native things. It is important to seperate human desire — the protection of native plants and animals — and the interests of spirits, since they are not the same.</description>

	  <description>A shining beacon in the dull, uniform and largely artificial world
 &amp;ndash; Olegas Truchanas (1923-1972)
These photos were taken across two trips to the West Coast of Tasmania. The first was in September 2020. The second was in April 2021. Each time it took about four or five hours to get there, driving along the only road that cuts through the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. It includes about a fifth of Tasmania&amp;rsquo;s landmass, covering almost all of the southwest.</description>

The Ramoin-Dupont Aircraft Company, with help from the research subsidiary of the absurdly-named “Government Aircraft Factories,” spent about two decades trying to get a reactor to fly. It was easy enough to build a plane around a fission reactor — the problem was keeping the pilot alive.</description>

That fact is the bedrock of the Vekllei way of life, in fact — land stewardship and dependency. In this sense, they owe a great debt to the physical landscape of the country, a concept usually translated as the ‘Landscape Sovereign’ in English. The human royals may be long dead, but Vekllei’s flowering petticoat society retains a monarch — the literal physical presence of the land.</description>

Is there anything gentler than a concrete platform in the middle of a flower-tundra, weathered and warmed by the sun?</description>

In the old days, many hundreds of years ago, Vekllei’s long, dark winters forced subsistence farmers to preserve their dishes for six or seven months of the year. This changed under the Junta, which opened trade with the Scandinavian powers, and Vekllei soon saw its growing population dependent on fresh imports of oats and grain from Europe.</description>

Though they fulfil police functions today, their history is with the Royal Guards and Federal Police of yesteryear, which in turn has produced unusual units like the Gold Sappers, which are unique in modern policing.</description>

The basic design has remained unchanged for over a hundred years, imported from the United States way back during the massive scrapping of junk warplanes after the Second World War. Even back during the Junta years the country had little respect for foreign intellectual property, and by 1949 had started rolling out Imitation Catalinas, which were among the first indigenous aircraft in the country.</description>

It is so old that in the Vekllei language its title is simply ‘Mail’ — the ‘Royal’ and ‘Vekllei’ are implied by the use of its hieroglyph. Founded in 1422 as part of the military communications system between government and mercantile government holdings, it has survived various restructurings — and several wars — to remain a critical communications and cultural institution today.</description>

They are found across the entire country in all types of hard and boring work, forever dutiful, forever mindless. It is not that the robot has replaced the human worker, since about 90% of Vekllei people are employed.</description>

	  <description>Archived from the original article here   a.book-btn:hover { filter: brightness(85%); }  It would be misleading to characterise Vekllei as environmentalist in the usual idea of the word. Vekllei is no such thing. This is obvious in subtle ways, like Newda’s Dumousiantopet, or “beautiful and seperate,” which advocates the separation of human and natural design. It is also policy; Vekllei is dependent on its landscape as part of Autosuffisouitopet, or “self-sustenance,” and to this end sinks forests for hydroelectric dams and topples mountains for novel urban projects.</description>

Today:
 Up in the ro, the Vekllei flower-tundra home to spirits and people alike, green slopes and igneous monument make an ample crucible for myth and magic.
 Out here, there was a very keen sense of place and purpose. “Landscape” was neither revered nor ignored, since it did not exist here altogether.</description>

She smiled at him, and looked to the town before them, and squinted at the clouds rising over the Atlantic horizon.
It was a warm late summer and there was salt in the air. Pebbles made better swimmers than Tzipora, but from up here she could admire the coast and fill her heart with the breeze.</description>

	  <description>Archived from the original article here   a.book-btn:hover { filter: brightness(85%); }  Almost any other venrouive national bureau is more glamorous than Vekllei’s Hydroburo, but that fact does not detract from the organ’s critical function.
Although the sophisticated age of robotics demands the incredible yield of nuclear fission, a significant minority of Vekllei’s electricity is produced by hydroelectric dams, which are jointly operated by the Thunderburo and Hydroburo.</description>

	  <description>Archived from the original article here   a.book-btn:hover { filter: brightness(85%); }  The Americas Bureau at National Intelligence (AB/NI), a semiautonomous organ of the covert operations council of the War Department, is recognised as the busiest of the continental bureaus. There is a lot to be busy with — the Dallas Secession, the Brazilian invasion of Bolivia, the Dallas nuclear lend-lease, and the reliability of Venezuelan oil production are all of some concern to Vekllei, and so AB/NI proactively has fingers in those pies.</description>

	  <description>Archived from the original article here   a.book-btn:hover { filter: brightness(85%); }  By 2047, Vekllei had a lot of broken men. Tens of thousands had alighted troop ships at the end of the War of Taiwan, only to find that pieces of their lives had unravelled overseas. Hardy, bronze-skinned boys were left with their ghosts, and those ghosts introduced them to drinking, and brawling, and suicide.
 As part of the Birmingham Convention and the second round of the Commonwealth War Trials, a young and recently defeated Vekllei nation was chained to a conflict that was beginning to fester in East Asia.</description>

In the days of the monarchy, it had been an unremarkable city, home to the empire’s submarine fleet. It was obliterated by bombs in the war, and the &amp;ldquo;new Montre&amp;rdquo; that has blossomed in its place is nourished by its ashes.</description>

Another stroke on the Hell Screen

Two dollars were in the sand
A hound had come here to rest
Damp cotton touched green water
She thought of what she was doing here
Of what the night invoked
Hot sand met a rising wind</description>

I post a lot of sketches to the Vekllei Discord, which is something between a fan club and a social club for the project.</description>

	  <description>Archived from the original article here   a.book-btn:hover { filter: brightness(85%); }  If you go back through my posts here, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice Tzipora is basically a cartoon whose only consistent characteristic is her iconography &amp;ndash; her hair fountain, bangs, round head and big smile. This isn&amp;rsquo;t really intentional. I&amp;rsquo;m just an amateur artist who is still learning to draw.
That doesn&amp;rsquo;t work so well in a comic with sequential panels, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on standardising my characters.</description>

Zhu is the first time in a long time I&amp;rsquo;ve drawn an ethnically Chinese person. She was graciously lent to me to draw by u/boodyclap in an art trade. You can see his end of the deal here, complete with Tzipora balancing a baseball bat.</description>

It was summer, and six days after Tzipora had arrived in Japan as a Gregori ambassador from Vekllei. Although she would not be the oldest victim of Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome until Quentin Cook’s (USA) infamous murder-suicide ten years later, she was one of the so-called &amp;ldquo;First Thirteen&amp;rdquo; publicised patients, and so was somewhat known to the international community.</description>

She held it self-consciously against her side as she watched the clouds navigate the sharp mountains that formed Montre’s deepest valleys. Even out here, where human presence was gentle and subservient to the land, Vekllei National Railways had tracks that serviced the smallest villages. Today it was high summer, and the slopes were green and free of ice.</description>

If she was feeling lively, she could make it to the platform in a half hour.</description>

Vekllei is an ancient culture with many inherited and vestigial artefacts. Nowhere is this more apparent than in her national dress, particularly that for women, where old and new collide as they do all across Vekllei.</description>

	  <description>Archived from the original article here   a.book-btn:hover { filter: brightness(85%); }   Tzipora here is wearing a simplified form of Vekllei’s national dress, which plays fast and loose with lace and showcases some of Vekllei’s more decadent iconography. Long gi (decorative quarter-pleats you’ve seen around) accompany sun petticoats, or Vekllei lace aprons. Flowers take the place of astrology or the Zodiac in Vekllei, and so they often accompany spiritual runes (in upotenne, or religious script) about the girl.</description>

The only sound was the wind, which caught the heads of dry grass and roared up the slopes of the mountain ranges around her.</description>

 The heavy clouds above were children of early spring, but among the steam vents it seemed like the whole sky was polluted by geysers.

Although the CN-1 Horizon Wing passenger jet was not a “flying wing,” that didn’t stop Comen Aeroyards, the manufacturer, from celebrating it as such. Much like similar large-wing aircraft from McDonnell and de Havilland, the CN-1’s large vertical stabilisers and obvious centre fuselage precluded it from qualifying as an authentic “flying wing,” which were already common in many air forces at this time.</description>

	  <description>Archived from the original article here   a.book-btn:hover { filter: brightness(85%); }  In this limited cross-section of a CN-1 “Horizon” Wing, the scale of the aircraft is immediately impressed upon the reader. It is nearly four times as wide as the older wide-body passenger jets of yesteryear, and twice as wide as most American and European supersonic jets. It is no coincidence that the “flying wing” concept was only made possible by the development of supersonic jetport infrastructure, with their wide and long runways, at the turn of the century.</description>

In Vekllei economic lexicon, a bureau is the largest trade union of an industry, made up of many hundreds of others, and is partially beholden to the direction of government.</description>

	  <description>Archived from the original article here   a.book-btn:hover { filter: brightness(85%); }  Welcome to the r/Vekllei variety hour, where the tone between posts judders so inconsistently you&amp;rsquo;ll get whiplash of the mind. I was just drawing and thinking today. This is an author post, in case you haven&amp;rsquo;t noticed &amp;ndash; just a shitty blog.
You see, even today I&amp;rsquo;m wildly jealous of the success of those slice-of-life artists on reddit and Twitter.</description>

As a sucker for uniforms I went with the garb of the Pruscyldan Academy of Magic, and you&amp;rsquo;ll find JM&amp;rsquo;s character, Honora being splattered with ice cream by Tzipora on the left and in Vekllei education uniform on the right.</description>

Hobart here. You might not know it, but I’m sort of a big fucking deal on the internet. No, don’t touch me. Why am I? Because my subreddit just hit 1,000 subscribers. What’s a subreddit? I’m actually laughing at you; imagine not knowing what reddit is. You ingrate.
Seriously though, this whole renewal of the project through a subreddit (rather than disconnected r/worldbuilding posts) has been an amazing thing.</description>

Most students study about 3-5 days a week, depending on the taste of the student and the work timetable of their parents.</description>

  Tzipora and Cobian, pictured here, have very different stories but both have felt something was not quite right about them. That difference, so it would turn out, would blossom into a preference for women as partners, in the unusual desexualised way Vekllei goes about homosexuality in the late 2070s.</description>

King had offended Zelda with an off-hand comment on her youthful appearance, and she’d retorted with a remark about his weak blood circulation. Moise, caught between his new boss and his angry Zelda, navigated these stormy waters by ignoring the dispute entirely and separating them on the walk home.</description>

	  <description>Archived from the original article here   a.book-btn:hover { filter: brightness(85%); }  In the quaint ocean country of Vekllei, during their years of fecundity and fun, the calendar is divided into twelve festivals of various celebration and purpose. They include the Festival of the Sea in October, which celebrates Vekllei’s vast fishing navy and concludes with the detonation of a nuclear weapon off Vekllei’s coast, to the Festival of the Moon in January, which is quiet and acknowledged only through personal ceremony and decorations.</description>

Woomera&amp;rsquo;s a closed government town that tests missiles. Not my finest illustration, but it is what it is.
Deep in the mountains around Montre, above a tangle of submerged forts and ballistic missile silos, there sits a Vekllei Rocketry Corps test facility called the Strawberry Site.</description>

	  <description>Archived from the original article here   a.book-btn:hover { filter: brightness(85%); }  For the first six months Baron had known her, Zelda was a serious and wisened young woman who carried symptoms of her troubled past as gracefully as anyone ever could. Poverty ages a person, and she’d nurtured a calm and dispirited disposition. She did not like war films or books with unhappy endings, or loud noises or arguments.</description>

They stop at upland villages and towns of sometimes only a few dozen people, before consolidating into larger terminuses that connect nearly every village in Vekllei by rail. It is possible, should the timetables align, that you can reach the capital from any part of the country in under 2 hours.</description>

Considering both the length and convoluted terminology that embroil this project, there was only so long I could carry on before people started getting lost. The truth of it is that Vekllei is not a particularly complex or difficult project to summarise, despite the snapshot &amp;ldquo;lore in scenes&amp;rdquo; approach that kneecaps a complete understanding.</description>

	  <description>Archived from the original article here   a.book-btn:hover { filter: brightness(85%); }  Zelda, for all her outward timidity and mousiness, was mostly self-assured. In the same way that a child is self-assured, in which there is no real epistemology of the self as adults know it. Zelda never grew up to become a real teen-ager, after all — her body is forever thirteen-and-a-half, despite her mature and maternal disposition — and so she had a reckless sort of confidence that never really doubted the premise of her existence.</description>

She was a once-in-a-generation editor, the kind of person who absorbed grammar rules on magical wavelengths beyond mortal comprehension and proceeded to violently enforce them. This was compounded by the Vekllei language, with its sublanguages and logography, leading to daily shouting matches in The Atlantic’s newsroom over sentence structure and colour as language.</description>

Zelda only knew him from the tram, where he carried a criminal stigma because of his rumoured gang affiliations. He was a second-generation Vekllei boy of immigrant Greek heritage. There were a few ethnic gangs in his area, and most immigrant boys that didn’t do well in school quickly found other causes to fight for.</description>

Total hedonism across a thousand generations produced the creature known as the ‘tooth regent’, who was a human by technicality but was built genetically only for consuming.

	  <description>Archived from the original article here   a.book-btn:hover { filter: brightness(85%); }  The foundations of a Vekllei neighbourhood, repeated so often to foreigners and children, is the community — a group of people larger than a family but small enough to have valuable social bonds through work and shared spaces. In a society without currency, value is almost entirely derived from your immediate surrounds.
Municipal police, as distinct from Venrouiva police, appear in many different roles in Vekllei communities.</description>

And, despite her enthusiasm, she was not very easy to sleep beside. She was prone to jerking movements and night terrors, and alternated between pushing her partner to the periphery and then clutching them in comfort.</description>

	  <description>Archived from the original article here   a.book-btn:hover { filter: brightness(85%); }  In Vekllei, the economy is a social organ that lingers awkwardly between cultural and political interests. On one hand, the country is regressing (both politically and culturally) towards deindustrialised, decommodified life. On the other, it is irreversibly equipped with the benefits of automation and robotics, rendering large swathes of the labour-force obsolete. Work is now, for most purposes, a creative organ that facilitates society, culture and technology.</description>

In others, it is a way of returning to the earth, and understanding the human place in the principles of Upen.</description>

Vekllei National Railways, or ‘VK Rail’ was the bastard of six major pre-war rail companies that were extinguished along with the society that housed them. Today there are three rail companies in Vekllei, but all of them operate under direct supervision of a Vekllei Industry Bureau (making it Venrouiva, in other words) and are only broken up for reasons of logistics.</description>

Nestled between the regional tram offices and the pre-war Ferouistet Department Store, the Lola district is not known for much but her department store and good schools.

They do not eat and will live forever, provided they stay within the gardens of the Palace and consummate their industrial godhood occasionally with domen, an opium that they believe purifies blood.</description>

They carry flags and banners in celebration of womanhood and remembrance of the dead — for those Potter’s Fields and unmarked graves that intern nameless women across the world.</description>

In the waning days of the military junta, the beast’s creators, the Sugarhouse Fort served as a strategic command centre for Vekllei’s nuclear arsenal and a blacksite to disappear the most prolific and dangerous agitators.</description>

This grass has large heads that can be eaten raw and taste citrusy and acidic as they only grow in toxic soils.</description>

As part of sundress municipalism, Vekllei’s villages and townships are mostly self-sufficient and self-regulating. Although a walk in the capital will take you past colossal apartment blocks and cinemas, libraries and schools of great magnificence, you are really looking at a hundred different communities going about personal business at their leisure.</description>

Unconventional inverted gull wings and embedded turbofan engines make for a striking and uniquely Vekllei aircraft.</description>

From preschool to university and beyond, all students wear a variant of the same uniform. The kindergartners may not wear a full gi and camisole pinafore, but the basic ensemble is still there. This is the girl’s one, and it’s much more elaborate than the boy’s uniform.</description>

Vekllei is a country at odds with itself. On one hand, it is universal in its politics and fundamentally internationalist; on the other it is a deeply traditional country that values bloodlines and heritage.</description>

There is no real distinction between the city of Vekllei and the state of Vekllei, at least internally. To them, the country and the city are the same, and the isolated population centres of Montre and Adouisneh are simply distant neighbourhoods. This is reflected in all manners of life — they are ethnically and culturally homogenous, patriotic, and largely uncompetitive.</description>

This alternative name is a ‘key’ to the full blood name of an individual, which are given in secret by the mother traditionally, but can be gifted by any mother-figure.</description>
