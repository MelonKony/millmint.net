      <description>Landscape in the Age of Frustration: Waugh’s Handful of Dust as Anti-Utopia 👒   ESSAY  Newsdesk Hobart Phillips #  🌺 Note from the Editor
This article was originally published in October 2019. It offers an analysis of Evelyn Waugh&amp;rsquo;s Handful of Dust through an anti-utopian prism.   Waugh&amp;rsquo;s A Handful of Dust has remarkable topography. The word can be extrapolated in this case in several ways; for one, the book is occupied by worldly, secular affairs, inextricably bound to a particular cultural landscape and absence of metaphysic.</description>

      <description>A Cashless Tokyo 🗼   ESSAY  Newsdesk Hobart Phillips #  🌺 Note from the Editor
This article was originally published in December 2018. Yes, it’s painfully self-concerned and a little painful to read back, but for newcomers to the project you might find some “obvious truths” about Vekllei you have not yet encountered.   I did not come to Tokyo to find a reference for the Petticoat Project, because utopia does not exist there for me.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here    NO REALTORS EXCEPT THE STATE ■ THE COUNTY THE AGENT OF THE STATE ■ THE ARCHITECT THE AGENT OF THE COUNTY
 It is clear that in Vekllei democracy is a way of living more than it is a form of government. After all, by metrics of representation, the Atlantic nation&amp;rsquo;s electoral system often sputters and fails, undermined by the bundling of the human and natural votes as equal, and the wildly disproportionate borough system.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here   In Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s vast interior, there are large areas of uninhabited land designated as off-limits terra nullius. This is kronaismioudelfia, or &amp;ldquo;crown land,&amp;rdquo; named for the Upen&amp;rsquo;s perception of all living creatures as god-kings rather than Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s historical monarchy.
It is very important to make a distinction between the modern nation-state and Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s preconception of itself.
This is a forced pacifism hoisted upon themselves, a disciplined fear integral to the deeper psychospiritual intuition within Upen.</description>

The wind had died and it seemed that she would follow it. Crazy shadows distorted beneath car headlights. It occurred to her in some way that, as she approached dying, she was living out the ultimate dramatic fantasy of the American misplaced girl, in the same way the townsmen were fulfilling their grotesque constellation of death by murdering women.</description>

This article appeared in Issue #2 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.   Vekllei, legendarily, does not use circulate currency. Goods and services are moved and offered arbitrarily, provided amply in abundance. Anything that is not abundant is manufactured and distributed directly under the control of a bureau, which is a trade organ responsible to the affairs of the country.</description>

Some industry associations attempt to limit availability to minors but generally it&amp;rsquo;s at the discretion of the shopkeeper. Often, shame and embarassment are more powerful tools than legislation in Vekllei.
Generally it&amp;rsquo;s pretty traditional stuff supported by columns and fiction, although it varies between pornographers.</description>

Talking about utopia in character is much harder. How can you find utopia in flawed and sometimes unattractive human beings? By what metric is the vague, intuitive values of a utopia measured against a living person?</description>

The Café Resmoiones approaches its hundredth birthday as the girls outside await their fifteenth. The building was once a kindergarten, so they’d been told, but through decades of Vekllei’s irreverent planning it had become a café. It was not a very good café, the food was shit, but the building was nice and it was at the bottom of Lola’s steep residential hill.</description>

 Six bodies hung from the Rodney Creek Railroad Bridge, without names. The leftmost corpse, which was a boy, had a sign slung around his neck with tomorrow’s 8am train on it. Besides the swaying boy was his father, and next to him was his mother, and so it went down the railroad bridge, counting off his little sisters and grandmama and so on.</description>

It was Tzipora&amp;rsquo;s first home in Vekllei, and it was where she lived with her father.</description>

In the waning days of the military junta, the beast’s creators, the Sugarhouse Fort served as a strategic command centre for Vekllei’s nuclear arsenal and a blacksite to disappear the most prolific and dangerous agitators.</description>
