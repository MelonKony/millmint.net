The typeface in this image is a preview version &amp;ldquo;Nay Aug&amp;rdquo; by Alex Tomlinson, who you can follow here.  Fruit Tingles (Fodsa Spas) are a chalky sweet popular in Vekllei. They fizz in your mouth and come in several flavours. They&amp;rsquo;re as popular today as they were a hundred and fifty years ago when they were first produced by Montre Confectionary in 1936.</description>
