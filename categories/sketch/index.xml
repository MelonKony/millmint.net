<p>As they approached adulthood, <a href="/corsosva/">compulsory service</a> loomed large in their futures like a great wall. The thing about compulsory service (or &lsquo;corsosva,&rsquo; as it was called) was that it could be dice toss, which was a hell of a thing for something that took four years of your life. You applied for jobs you might like to do, but if they were full or you didn&rsquo;t make the cut, you could find yourself on the other side of the country doing clerical work or working construction in the Arctic.</p>
<p>No, thank you. There was a scheme that allowed teenagers too young to start corsosva to accumulate credit towards it, which would deduct from the total length of service. You still had to work, but at least you had security in choosing where you were.</p>
<p>For Isuri and Catia, they picked up casual work after school at their local <a href="/united-grocers/">United Grocers</a>. Vekllei might be a society of miracles, but their groceries look the same as anywhere, and the work was easy and boring. Their neighbourhood was small and they knew everyone who came through.</p>
<p>Their jobs were unadventurous, but the store was owned by a neighbour of Isuri and they goofed off a lot or sat outside in the sun when it was quiet. The stock robot did most of the work, so they were really just around to keep an eye on things, and often read magazines or played chess to pass the time.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>As a union of Atlantic communities, <a style="color: var(--color-millmint)" href="/vekllei/"><span class="fi fi-com"></span> Vekllei</a> has no single culture and consequently no single national dress. It does, however, have a national personification: <a href="/veletia/">Veletia</a>, a historic illustration of pan-Atlanticism who today makes up one of &ldquo;six sisters&rdquo; which represent the Commonwealth in total. The &ldquo;sisters&rdquo; are not in fact six seperate characters but are different forms of the same figure; homoousion manifestations of a single national spirit.</p>
<p>Because of this, Veletia is closely associated with Vekllei society and the <a href="/civic-commons/">civic commons</a>, and unity and transcultural commonhoods are strongly emphasised by the Commonwealth. As such, Veletia&rsquo;s common appearance inspires a <em>de facto</em> national dress, which varies between <a href="/constituents/">constituents</a> but has the same basic elements.</p>
<p>The example above demonstrates Oslolan culture, hence the Gi and Petty Cape. In Vekllei&rsquo;s Caribbean and mid-Atlantic republics, the outfit is modified for climate, shortening the stockings, using lighter materials and dispensing with the cape. The main dress most closely resembles a <em>chiton</em>, a kind of historic garment common in Doric and Ionian Greek history. You&rsquo;ll see Greek-inspired names, styles and features throughout Vekllei, which might imply a grandiose national self-identity, but is more likely a means of avoiding emphasis of any one culture within the diverse country.</p>
<p>Like most Vekllei forms of dress, it is heavily accessorised and flexible to cultural tastes. Dress in Vekllei is concerned with commonhoods rather than differences, and so it is very common to change aspects or add items to reflect different cultures, most commonly regional patterns, colours and jewellery. The Veletian dress is most often seen where Vekllei republics meet, as an extension of the Commonwealth identity &ndash; particularly holidays, celebrations and meetings. It is worn as a kind of formal dress for certain school and business occasions.</p>
<p>It is also, of course, a symbol of Vekllei&rsquo;s unique inwardness, living politics and level of social control. Like Commonwealth culture, Veletian national dress is at its roots artificial, informed by historic political rather than cultural traditions. But as with other aspects of the Commonwealth idea, once it is lived, worn, spoken and repeated by ordinary people, it becomes real and takes on a life of its own. It is an identity by consent, and part of the shared Vekllei project &ndash; a democracy not just in politics but in culture, traditions and aspirations.</p>

In this setting, the North Atlantic is a bit more temperate thanks to the Oslolan Low Pole and strong ocean currents. Still, they&rsquo;re acclimatised to cool air, and 25¬∞C (77¬∞F) is hot weather for them.]]>

<p>Oslola is part of <a style="color: var(--color-millmint)" href="/vekllei/"><span class="fi fi-com"></span> Vekllei</a>, and is known as Iceland in our own world. In this setting, the North Atlantic is a bit more temperate thanks to the Oslolan Low Pole and strong ocean currents. Still, they&rsquo;re acclimatised to cool air, and 25¬∞C (77¬∞F) is hot weather for them.</p>

<p>This character belongs to a Japanese artist and train enthusiast I follow on Twitter. Something about her appearance and oversized glasses were really funny to me, so I decided to draw her. This must have been out of left field for him, since I&rsquo;d never interacted with him before, but he really liked it!</p>
<p>Her name is Sabae-chan, and was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/unagiPost">@unagiPost</a>. &ldquo;Sabae&rdquo; is a city in Japan famous for manufacturing, well, glasses.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/unagiPost">@unagiPost</a> liked my drawing:</p>

<p>So I said she was planning to go on vacation:</p>
<p>


 
<figure>
  <img src="/images/fullres/sabae-2.jpg" alt="image of Sabae-chan and Cobian"  loading="lazy" />
  
</figure>
</p>
<p>His followers reacted with amusement that someone from Australia was drawing his characters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re an international cultured person!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This character is more popular with overseas followers than in Japan, so I would like to consider adding English without joking.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have to study English! &lsquo;Lady Sabae.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>

</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how the internet connects train enthusiasts.</p>

<p>The M2 &ldquo;Stallion&rdquo; is the backbone of the army. It carries everything from troops to stretchers to fission reactors across streets, sand and snow. It is customisable at the factory and in the field, and can serve nearly any role for Vekllei&rsquo;s fast-moving, hard-hitting army regiments.</p>
<p>It is a medium-wheelbase<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> utility vehicle with a naturally aspirated 6-cylinder, 4.6 litre diesel engine made by Atlantic Auto. No one company can lay claim to the success of the vehicle &ndash; the M2 is the result of industrial collaboration on a national scale, involving hundreds of contractors to meet a visionary committee brief. It has a 5-speed manual transmission with front and rear locking hubs that allow it to leap up boulders, with enough torque to tow armoured vehicles out of the line of fire.</p>
<p>Almost all aspects of the vehicle can be repaired and replaced in the field. The electrical system, engine block and panelling are accessible and modular. Its reliability is famous, and it will run happily for hundreds of thousands of kilometres in fire and ice.</p>
<p>The M2 can be configured as an ambulance, troop carrier, power supply, fuel truck, gun platform, or for many dozens of other uses as required. To this end, it forms the basis of Vekllei&rsquo;s flexible military logistics systems, and should be regarded as essential to the Vekllei Army as their rifles.</p>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>The M2 also comes in six-wheel configurations for heavier payloads.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Healthcare in Vekllei is universal, and run as a government service for the wellbeing of the public. The system is financed and governed by the Commonwealth Health Secretariat, and is provided regionally by national health authorities.</p>
<p>There is no cost to any treatment in the Vekllei healthcare system, and it covers all kinds of care necessary for a comfortable and dignified life. Healthcare professionals, including doctors and nurses, are highly regarded in the Commonwealth and enjoy considerable benefits provided by their health authority. All Vekllei households have an elected doctor, called a General Practitioner, who is their first point of contact with the health system.</p>
<p>Elective cosmetic surgery is uncommon in Vekllei and hard to receive, so medical tourism is a popular way to receive cosmetic dental treatment and other elective procedures, which occur most commonly in the US or Europe.</p>

<p>On the left is Ms Zora Ninƒçiƒá, and on the right Mr Kowalczyk. Students joke that they must be brother and sister because they look similar, but they&rsquo;re unrelated. Ms Ninƒçiƒá teaches social sciences, and Mr Kowalczyk teaches chemistry.</p>
<p>Tzipora is a somewhat poor student, but she is well-loved by these teachers, and they go above and beyond in helping Tzipora muster the grades she&rsquo;ll need to go on to university. She is very grateful to them.</p>
<p>There are rumours Mr Kowalczyk has a crush on Ms Ninƒçiƒá.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I based Kowalczyk off Steve Gadd, my favourite session drummer of all time, and Ninƒçiƒá off a woman who sold me a bus ticket in croatia, who had this wild curly hair afro but looked Slavic.
It&rsquo;s also an example of teachers wearing similar uniforms (in their case, more of a dress code) to students.</p>

<p>The <em>crown</em> depicted here is not the actual crown of the Vekllei Sovereign,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> but in fact the national hat of Vekllei and is part of traditional dress. This &lsquo;crown,&rsquo; so-called, is a felt or velvet hat with two peaks and a tall, narrow brim stitched with traditional patterns in gold thread. Historically, the crown was a work hat made of leather and wool, but today it is designed primarily for fashion and comfort, and is most commonly seen at ceremonies, schools and some professions like the <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/interior/defence/#police-of-the-public">Public Police</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-gi">
  The Gi
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-gi">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The <em>gi</em> is a women&rsquo;s &lsquo;quarter-pleat,&rsquo; and is one of several styles of separated &lsquo;pleats&rsquo; used in Vekllei traditional dress. It consists of a strip of fabric about the width of a leg, stitched with <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language/#rapotenne">Rapotenne</a> runes to communicate familial or spiritual heritage.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Traditionally gi were worn to the hem length of traditional skirts (at the ankle), but have shortened with skirt fashions in modernity. Similarly, many modern gi use regular <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language/#topet">Topet</a> in place of Rapotenne, which signals a cultural shift of their use away from spiritual artefacts towards secular cultural items. The popularity of the gi today is the result of their use in uniforms in education and some professions, introducing the practice and style to Vekllei&rsquo;s large immigrant populations and ensuring the gi&rsquo;s survival into the Floral Period. Gi mostly remain formal or ceremonial wear for special occasions, but are seeing some limited use in modern fashions.</p>

<p><strong>Fruit Tingles</strong> (<em>Fodsa Spas</em>) are a chalky sweet popular in Vekllei. They fizz in your mouth and come in several flavours. They&rsquo;re as popular today as they were a hundred and fifty years ago when they were first produced by Montre Confectionary in 1936.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re exported and enjoyed all over the commonwealth, from Kala to Kalina.</p>
<p>Clockwise: <strong>Hen</strong>, from Kus (Kala), <strong>Bez</strong>, from Demon, <strong>Tzipora</strong>, from Seispri (Vekllei) and <strong>Sydney</strong>, from Montesur (Kalina).</p>
