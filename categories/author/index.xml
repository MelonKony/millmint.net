      <description>Archived from the original article here  ðŸŒ¼ Featured in the Atlantic
This article appeared in Issue #5 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.  It&amp;rsquo;s been a week since I&amp;rsquo;ve posted. Most of that was spent drawing the same thing over and over.
A painting? Please. That&amp;rsquo;s a day&amp;rsquo;s work â€” maybe two. A five second loop of Tzipora jumping in and shuffling over? A week.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  ðŸŒ¼ Featured in the Atlantic
This article appeared in Issue #4 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.  Hello,
Iâ€™m Hobart. Iâ€™ve been working on this project for a while now. It doesnâ€™t really have a purpose or an end goal â€” I just want to draw and write about nice things, and Iâ€™m learning a lot on the way.</description>

This article appeared in Issue #2 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.  What is Vekllei?
Hi, Iâ€™m Hobart and I write and draw Vekllei at Studio MillMint.
This is a pretty complex project. Not just complex insofar as thereâ€™s a lot to read about it, but that it uses concepts and terminology you might not be familiar with if this is your first time around utopian fiction.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Hello everyone. Just a little update.
As a way of thanking my Patrons, Iâ€™m taking some time over the next two weeks or so to create a little set of Tzipora postcards and send them out as gifts.
How many cards will the set contain?
 Iâ€™m aiming for about six cards.
 How much money would you need to have forked over to get some?</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Despite appearances, most of the population of Vekllei are Scandinavian, not Asian.
Zhu is the first time in a long time I&amp;rsquo;ve drawn an ethnically Chinese person. She was graciously lent to me to draw by u/boodyclap in an art trade. You can see his end of the deal here, complete with Tzipora balancing a baseball bat.
In Zhu&amp;rsquo;s homeland she suffers a meat-heavy diet, and Vekllei is the first time she&amp;rsquo;s seen a salad this big.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  This is it. The dates are laid out. I&amp;rsquo;ve created a document that tracks the story thus far. Longtime followers might be surprised by where certain events land.
This post will be pinned and serve as a stopgap until I can complete something more professional on my site.

      <title>Hobart and Tzipora are off to Japan</title>

      <description>Archived from the original article here   Tzipora here is wearing a simplified form of Veklleiâ€™s national dress, which plays fast and loose with lace and showcases some of Veklleiâ€™s more decadent iconography. Long gi (decorative quarter-pleats youâ€™ve seen around) accompany sun petticoats, or Vekllei lace aprons. Flowers take the place of astrology or the Zodiac in Vekllei, and so they often accompany spiritual runes (in upotenne, or religious script) about the girl.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Moise has somehow been swindled out of his slow dance in Zeldaâ€™s eighth floor New Years party. Iâ€™d like to invite everyone here to come celebrate at the new Vekllei discord â€” we mostly argue about architecture and share art and stories. No pressure, but at least you can hassle me directly about the gap between posts. Speaking of which, this one is a substitute â€” the one Iâ€™m working on ended up being a bit too sad for an exciting new year, so Iâ€™ll put the sad stuff off until Jan 2nd in favour of something happier tomorrow.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Iâ€™m still eating pudding, but once Iâ€™m home tomorrow and settled at my drawing desk Iâ€™ll be sure to report Tziporaâ€™s holiday adventures in full.
For the Christmasfolk out there, enjoy your presents. To everyone else, have a good holiday and be sure to celebrate the Australian way â€” with prawns, salmon and snags on the barbie.
(Gorgeous 25Â°C [77Â°F] yesterday)
Best,</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here   He kept bad hours. Sometimes he worked so hard he came home in the early morning and fell asleep to the television with the subtitles on. Like a guerrilla sighting a commanding officer, she would approach discreetly, wearing her blanket like a cape and bouncing on her toes. With a gentle movement she&amp;rsquo;d drape it over him and listen for a break in his snoring.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Welcome to the r/Vekllei variety hour, where the tone between posts judders so inconsistently you&amp;rsquo;ll get whiplash of the mind. I was just drawing and thinking today. This is an author post, in case you haven&amp;rsquo;t noticed &amp;ndash; just a shitty blog.
You see, even today I&amp;rsquo;m wildly jealous of the success of those slice-of-life artists on reddit and Twitter. I still don&amp;rsquo;t understand the genre entirely, as a phenomenon.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  I had the wonderful opportunity to work with one of our resident worldbuilders on reddit, u/EpicJM, and spend a while with their world and characters. The world of Eipljord has a lot of distinct, unique cultures and characters. As a sucker for uniforms I went with the garb of the Pruscyldan Academy of Magic, and you&amp;rsquo;ll find JM&amp;rsquo;s character, Honora being splattered with ice cream by Tzipora on the left and in Vekllei education uniform on the right.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  The main beach in Mumen, the nicest of the seaside districts, is constructed out of sand imported from the dunes of Africa. Where the rest of the country has black sand, a symptom of its volcanic turbulence, Mumen has nice yellow sand.
Baron doesnâ€™t like the water, and getting him down to the sea at all was a trial. Zelda, for her part, sinks faster than lead in water and only ventures into the shallows with Ayn, who herself is afraid of the deeper ocean.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Hello everyone,
Thanks again for subscribing to this subreddit. Iâ€™m playing a game of chicken right now pitting my little Vekllei projects against my university work.
Vekllei boys uniforms (and school architecture) is coming later this week, turning Study Week into a Study Month!
Starting from next week, several exciting projects are getting kicked into gear. One is the graphic novel. Thereâ€™s also the Vekllei wiki, which is under construction.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Well isnâ€™t this exciting! The talented u/Herald_of_Zena decided to draw Isabelle from his world in the uniforms I posted the other day. It was too much fun not to join in. It turned out to be a classic story told in two parts &amp;ndash; shit weather, put on coat.
Itâ€™s a pleasure seeing such a unique style thatâ€™s really one of a kind in the worldbuilding scene.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Thank you very much everyone. It&amp;rsquo;s very exciting for me. I ordered a cake from Banjos to celebrate but Tzipora got it all over the floor and herself.
Thanks for subscribing. I&amp;rsquo;ve been pushing myself a bit too hard and my writing&amp;rsquo;s suffered for it. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I can slow down, I&amp;rsquo;m just not that kind of guy, but I want to promise some exciting adventures in the future as we hang out with Zelda and her loved ones.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  I have a research proposal due today, and since I&amp;rsquo;m pretending to still be a university student I suppose I&amp;rsquo;d better do it.
I spend a lot of time thinking about what the hell I&amp;rsquo;m doing with my life, and after a while I get hungry. Banjos &amp;ndash; a very Australian name for a bakery chain &amp;ndash; satiates my existential hunger with two bacon and cheese pull-apart loaves for $10.</description>

      <title>A Brief Introduction to Vekllei</title>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Editor&amp;rsquo;s note: this article, while ready for reading, is still under construction.
Considering both the length and convoluted terminology that embroil this project, there was only so long I could carry on before people started getting lost. The truth of it is that Vekllei is not a particularly complex or difficult project to summarise, despite the snapshot &amp;ldquo;lore in scenes&amp;rdquo; approach that kneecaps a complete understanding.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Vekllei is a country in my alt-world; a utopian fever dream of googie aesthetics, participatory economics and nostalgia.
Welcome to the â€˜Petticoat Projectâ€™, a collection of stories about a country and a girl.Â The concept is broken down into three sections:
 Author:Â for blog posts and articles on the Petticoat Project, utopian fiction, personal news item, etc. Character:Â for posts about Tzipora, people in her life, or otherwise events that occur during her time on Earth.</description>
