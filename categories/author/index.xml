      <description>Hello everyone. Just a little update.
As a way of thanking my Patrons, Iâ€™m taking some time over the next two weeks or so to create a little set of Tzipora postcards and send them out as gifts.
How many cards will the set contain?
 Iâ€™m aiming for about six cards.
 How much money would you need to have forked over to get some?
 I think about $20 over your pledge lifetime would cover print and shipping, though Iâ€™ll let you know if that goes up or down.</description>

      <description>Vekllei is a country in my alt-world; a utopian fever dream of googie aesthetics, participatory economics and nostalgia.
Welcome to the â€˜Petticoat Projectâ€™, a collection of stories about a country and a girl.Â The concept is broken down into three sections:
 Author:Â for blog posts and articles on the Petticoat Project, utopian fiction, personal news item, etc. Character:Â for posts about Tzipora, people in her life, or otherwise events that occur during her time on Earth.</description>
