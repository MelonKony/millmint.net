      <description>Archived from the original article here  ðŸŒ¼ Featured in the Atlantic
This article appeared in Issue #5 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.  It&amp;rsquo;s been a week since I&amp;rsquo;ve posted. Most of that was spent drawing the same thing over and over.
A painting? Please. That&amp;rsquo;s a day&amp;rsquo;s work â€” maybe two. A five second loop of Tzipora jumping in and shuffling over? A week.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  ðŸŒ¼ Featured in the Atlantic
This article appeared in Issue #4 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.  Hello,
Iâ€™m Hobart. Iâ€™ve been working on this project for a while now. It doesnâ€™t really have a purpose or an end goal â€” I just want to draw and write about nice things, and Iâ€™m learning a lot on the way.</description>

This article appeared in Issue #2 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.  What is Vekllei?
Hi, Iâ€™m Hobart and I write and draw Vekllei at Studio MillMint.
This is a pretty complex project. Not just complex insofar as thereâ€™s a lot to read about it, but that it uses concepts and terminology you might not be familiar with if this is your first time around utopian fiction.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Hello everyone. Just a little update.
As a way of thanking my Patrons, Iâ€™m taking some time over the next two weeks or so to create a little set of Tzipora postcards and send them out as gifts.
How many cards will the set contain?
 Iâ€™m aiming for about six cards.
 How much money would you need to have forked over to get some?</description>

      <title>Salad Time</title>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Despite appearances, most of the population of Vekllei are Scandinavian, not Asian.
Zhu is the first time in a long time I&amp;rsquo;ve drawn an ethnically Chinese person. She was graciously lent to me to draw by u/boodyclap in an art trade. You can see his end of the deal here, complete with Tzipora balancing a baseball bat.
In Zhu&amp;rsquo;s homeland she suffers a meat-heavy diet, and Vekllei is the first time she&amp;rsquo;s seen a salad this big.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  This is it. The dates are laid out. I&amp;rsquo;ve created a document that tracks the story thus far. Longtime followers might be surprised by where certain events land.
This post will be pinned and serve as a stopgap until I can complete something more professional on my site.

      <title>Hobart and Tzipora are off to Japan</title>

      <description>Archived from the original article here   Tzipora here is wearing a simplified form of Veklleiâ€™s national dress, which plays fast and loose with lace and showcases some of Veklleiâ€™s more decadent iconography. Long gi (decorative quarter-pleats youâ€™ve seen around) accompany sun petticoats, or Vekllei lace aprons. Flowers take the place of astrology or the Zodiac in Vekllei, and so they often accompany spiritual runes (in upotenne, or religious script) about the girl.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Moise has somehow been swindled out of his slow dance in Zeldaâ€™s eighth floor New Years party. Iâ€™d like to invite everyone here to come celebrate at the new Vekllei discord â€” we mostly argue about architecture and share art and stories. No pressure, but at least you can hassle me directly about the gap between posts. Speaking of which, this one is a substitute â€” the one Iâ€™m working on ended up being a bit too sad for an exciting new year, so Iâ€™ll put the sad stuff off until Jan 2nd in favour of something happier tomorrow.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Vekllei is a country in my alt-world; a utopian fever dream of googie aesthetics, participatory economics and nostalgia.
Welcome to the â€˜Petticoat Projectâ€™, a collection of stories about a country and a girl.Â The concept is broken down into three sections:
 Author:Â for blog posts and articles on the Petticoat Project, utopian fiction, personal news item, etc. Character:Â for posts about Tzipora, people in her life, or otherwise events that occur during her time on Earth.</description>
