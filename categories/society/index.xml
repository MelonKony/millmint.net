<p><strong>Bureaus</strong> in Vekllei are industrial syndicates of companies that represent substantial or monopoly power over an industrial market. Their existence is recognised by Vekllei economic policy as a means of furnishing a reasonable standard of living for Vekllei people outside of the anarchy of the <a href="/factbook/society/state/finance/#domestic-markets">private markets</a>. As a result, bureaus are concerned primarily with the public good and industrial policy.</p>
<p>Bureaus typically consist of a general council, which organise votes from workers in subsidiary companies into <em>company ballots</em>, which are used to establish standards and self-regulate industry. Bureau membership also allows interaction with the <a href="/factbook/society/state/finance/#international-markets">Vekllei International Market</a>, and provide a means for foreign investment and export. Companies within bureaus still compete against each other.</p>
<p>The largest bureaus include <em>Electra</em> and <a href="/universal-cotton/"><em>Universal Cotton</em></a>. Electra represents a collection of state-owned electricity generation companies, and Universal Cotton consists of over a hundred individual clothing manufacturers. Although state monopolies may form a bureau in part or as a whole, bureau membership does not necessarily imply state ownership.</p>

<h2 id="overview">
  Overview
  <a class="anchor" href="#overview">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Vekllei uses electric computers in a range of industrial and commercial applications, which contributes to the increasing automation of the Vekllei Commonwealth workforce. Contemporary computing, known as the photo-electric generation, relies on optical technologies developed by the U.S. military in the 1980s, and were subsequently revolutionised by holographic memory by the U.K. in the 2030s. Vekllei computer science inherits much of its technology database from the U.K. through the Twin Electric research programme, and has contributed significantly to the efficiency and reliability of holographic data storage.</p>
<p>Vekllei has several computer manufacturers, including Votraitey Electrics and National Machines S.A.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Votraitey provides commercial imaging services for holographic memory, particularly the DataPlex Photovolumes, and National Machines construct photo-electric mainframes suitable for enterprise-scale networking. The home of Vekllei computer science is the National Photonic Laboratories at Vekllei National University, with industrial research contributed by National Computer&rsquo;s Logic Mechanics division. The Commonwealth aims to be independent of foreign-made components and circuitry by the end of the century.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-computing">
  Types of Computing
  <a class="anchor" href="#types-of-computing">#</a>
</h2>
<p>There are two types of commercial computing in use in Vekllei.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Photo-Electric Computers</strong> (PEC), which are electric machines that are capable of parallel arithmetic and logical operations.</li>
<li><strong>Fabricated Live Robotics</strong>, which combine computers with synthetic biological components to unlock adaptive and sensory functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Computing in Vekllei happens at a civic or industrial scale, and rarely interacts with individuals for personal purposes. Most ordinary Vekllei people interact with computers through work or in schools and libraries, where they serve data-lookup and communication purposes. Civilian life in Vekllei is decidedly analogue.</p>
<h3 id="photo-electric-computing">
  Photo-Electric Computing
  <a class="anchor" href="#photo-electric-computing">#</a>
</h3>
<p>All programmable Vekllei computers use photo-electric circuits<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> instead of electric transistors and semiconductors. In a Vekllei photo-electric computer, micro-lasers are produced by a wafer made up of mirrors and a cavity to perform digital computations. In place of silicon transistors are photonic crystals called <em>Syncretic Crystal Mechanisms</em>, which reflect light at different wavelengths and form an optical integrated circuit. Devices called spatial light modulators<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> moderate the intensity and phase of these light beams, which are stored as holograms within a crystal as a form of digital memory. These holographic crystals, called <em>Photovolumes</em>, are able to be written and read in parallel, allowing instant access to records in a networked computer system. Most computers contain a protected archive system that duplicates and write-protects data.</p>
<p>Because photo-electric computers require large processing elements to facilitate nonlinear computing and its unique signal-processing devices, computers in Vekllei are heavily centralised and are not found in households. Most large industrial and commercial enterprises maintain a single room-sized &lsquo;Master Computer&rsquo; that networks satellite terminals concurrently. Some centralised industries consolidate master computers into a single photo-electric-robotic system (PER) called an Automatic Asset Command. Famous examples are the Automatic Train Control, which automates <a href="/factbook/society/industry/rail/">Vekllei National Rail</a> operations and programmes robots that can automate train service, and the Vekllei State Archives which maintain a written record of all items in several archival Photovolumes, managed by the Archival Master Computer.</p>
<p>The size, speed and accessibility of data storage in Vekllei means that more data than ever is recorded and preserved, making Vekllei one of the most recorded societies in history. As the site of the Atlantic Telephone and Data Exchange, Vekllei also handles tremendous amounts of trans-Atlantic data regeneration and processing.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Although processing is usually offloaded to more powerful master computers, Vekllei makes extensive use of organic robotics to automate processes and functions where adaptivity to sensory input is required. These robots, called <em>automasiosn</em> or &lsquo;automen,&rsquo; combine fabricated organic brains with photo-electric circuits to create a programmable, adaptive robot.</p>
<p>Artificial substrates of crystal, called command clocks, are knitted into vat-grown brain tissue to organically process commands. These commands are sometimes digital-optical signals from a master computer, or can be produced by onboard circuitry in response to sensory stimulus. The fabricated brain has natural instincts for balance and orientation, but otherwise bears little resemblance to living, sentient brains. Command clocks in Vekllei are generally made from synthetic quartz and are ionised in manufacturing to enable cartographic crystal pathways, which pass information to axon guns. These guns propel electric signals into the organic tissue, combining the reactivity of organic reflexes with sterile programmability. Newer automen are capable of parallel operations through vertical command wafers.</p>
<p>Automen are used in a variety of roles in Vekllei, including as independent robotic machines and as processing units for systems and data. They are most well known as independent machines, usually tracked or on wheels, that perform a variety of low-skill labour in Vekllei in public places and factories.</p>
<h2 id="accessibility-and-utility">
  Accessibility and Utility
  <a class="anchor" href="#accessibility-and-utility">#</a>
</h2>
<p>All Vekllei people can access computers through public libraries, universities and some schools. These facilities are networked into the National Bulletin System (NBS), a sort of digital bulletin board that allows for real-time communication, content sharing and electronic mail. The National Bulletin System makes up part of the Vekllei Public Intranet, which can be accessed through terminals found in many schools, post offices and libraries. The Vekllei Government and large businesses also maintain their own intranets for use among staff. Computer subcultures exist in Vekllei and participate in unsanctioned network access through home-built relays and primitive hobby computers, a practice known as &lsquo;phreaking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Public Intranet is anonymous, but terminals signal their hardware address to the public mainframe, which allows users to specify the location of others. The NBS displays these addresses as postcodes by default.</p>
<p>Vekllei computers use calligraphic displays<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, which allow primitive vector graphics. Most Vekllei file systems, including the Public Intranet, are text-only and use the VEKSCOPE character encoding standard.</p>

<p><strong>Consosva</strong> (a portmanteau of <em>consivismiosn sovis</em>, lit. &ldquo;<em>contributory service</em>&rdquo;) refers to a collection of laws that require adult citizens in Vekllei to be employed. The legal obligation is fairly straightforward and is easily avoided, and in practice acts as a form of moral pressure from the state.</p>
<p>Consosva is a legal obligation to register an occupation with your municipality, which forwards its ledger to the Vekllei government. This is to encourage productivity and discourage &ldquo;social parasitism,&rdquo; as a requirement to contribute to the wealth of society. Failure to do so is considered a crime and is usually penalised with community service.</p>
<p>Consosva has many recognised exemptions, including full-time study, participating in <a href="/corsosva/">Compulsory Service</a>, acting as the primary caregiver of children, and poor health.</p>
<p>Consosva applies to Vekllei citizens or permanent residents aged between 22 and 50.</p>

<p>Education in Vekllei is a good example of the &lsquo;system working backwards,&rsquo; the popular phrase to describe the Floral Period moving in two different directions at once. Is it modern, supplied and robust in the Western tradition &ndash; children wear uniforms, are divided into school years and learning is arranged and taught in subjects. Other aspects of the Vekllei curriculum, like its provisions for extracurricular activities and social clubs, are novel by comparison.</p>
<p>There is something quite interesting going on in Vekllei education that is not immediately apparent at its surface. First, compulsory schooling runs between 3-5 days a week, depending on student commitments to elective and extracurricular activities. Government schools do not employ standardised testing, and rely on subject-specific means of assessment including reviews, presentations and portfolios. The <a href="#curriculum">Vekllei Curriculum</a> emphasises practicable and technical skills that blur the lines between school, community and home.</p>
<p>Education in Vekllei is considered a foundation of Vekllei democracy, and in the spirit of the Floral Period it is free, abundant and compulsory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Education is a founding aspect of the 4th Commonwealth and is to be reaffirmed constantly and faithfully by all Parliaments and public servants, and to this end is to be provided for as a highest priority of the new Parliament.</p>

  Administration and Funding

</h3>
<p>All forms of education in Vekllei are free, including for international students at a tertiary level. The system is funded by the <a href="/solcom/">Commonwealth Education Secretariat (SOLCOM)</a>, which also administers the school curriculum and some schools directly.</p>
<h3 id="schools">
  Schools
  <a class="anchor" href="#schools">#</a>
</h3>
<p>There are several different types of school in Vekllei, but all are government-funded and adhere to the compulsory curriculum outlined by the Education Secretary. The <a href="#uniform">Vekllei Education Uniform</a> is compulsory for all students, including at independent schools.</p>
<h4 id="state-schools">
  State Schools
  <a class="anchor" href="#state-schools">#</a>
</h4>
<p>State schools (also Central Schools) are administered and funded directly by the Education Secretariat, and are common in cities and in Commonwealth member-states. They are traditionally larger and better equipped, and usually provide for both primary and secondary schooling. Some state schools are also district colleges, meaning they serve students from <a href="#preparatory-school">Prep</a> to Year 12 or 13.</p>
<h4 id="community-schools">
  Community Schools
  <a class="anchor" href="#community-schools">#</a>
</h4>
<p>Community schools are usually administered by a borough or <a href="/municipalities/">municipality</a>, and are usually smaller than state schools. Although some community schools may combine primary and secondary schooling (called district schools), most serve only primary education. Community schools may also refer to village schools, or community-run schools in the local Vekllei tradition.</p>
<h4 id="studio--technical-schools">
  Studio &amp; Technical Schools
  <a class="anchor" href="#studio--technical-schools">#</a>
</h4>
<p>Studio and technical schools typically refer to secondary schools that specialise in arts or vocational curriculums, as a means to fast-track gifted learning. These schools may offer boarding, as only a few studio and technical schools exist across the Commonwealth and smaller member-states may send their students overseas to study there.</p>
<h4 id="faith-schools">
  Faith Schools
  <a class="anchor" href="#faith-schools">#</a>
</h4>
<p>Faith schools in Vekllei are affiliated with an approved religious organisation. The curriculum of faith schools have a religious character, usually Jewish or Roman Catholic. Faith schools are still required to adhere to the <a href="#curriculum">Commonwealth curriculum</a> as a minimum education standard. Faith Schools are also an exception to the universal coeducational system of the Commonwealth, since two schools in Oslola and one in the Kalina Isles are single-sex boarding schools.</p>
<h4 id="boarding-schools">
  Boarding Schools
  <a class="anchor" href="#boarding-schools">#</a>

<p>Vekllei offers a handful of boarding schools, which are usually specialised institutions that may operate as orphanages or for international students. Some Vekllei boarding schools include aspects of democratic education.</p>

<p>Vekllei people are enrolled in 9 years of compulsory education, provided by the <a href="/solsec/">Commonwealth Education Secretariat</a> (SOLSEC). In addition, 3 years of pre-school and 3 years of senior secondary schooling are offered but not compulsory. All schools in Vekllei are funded by the state, which include community schools, state schools, studio schools, technical schools, faith schools and state boarding schools.</p>
<p>Compared to modern schooling overseas, Vekllei education places significant value on well-roundedness and practicable household and technical skills. Subject-based streams for specialised learning are common, but the basic compulsory Vekllei curriculum emphasises non-academic subjects and structures pre-tertiary subjects as electives.</p>

</p>
<p>Vekllei has a strong tradition of school clubs and social organisations, and these are considered essential aspects of Vekllei education. Clubs and associations are usually organised by student leadership, and offer opportunities in industry and tertiary study.</p>
<p>Compulsory and tertiary education is free for all Vekllei people, permanent residents and foreign workers. Homeschooling is illegal except by those holding a teaching certificate, and is supervised by a local school which issues the child&rsquo;s diploma. In this context, homeschooling is almost nonexistent in the Commonwealth. About 15% of the Commonwealth Budget is allocated towards education.</p>

<p>Vekllei offers preschooling from ages 3 onwards. Garden School, or kindergarten, is for 3 &amp; 4 year-olds in Vekllei, and assists with the transition from home to school, followed by preparatory school, or &lsquo;prep&rsquo;, which is the first year of compulsory primary education.</p>
<p>Vekllei primary education consists of 7 years, starting with <a href="#preparatory-school">Prep</a> at ages 5-6 and concluding with Year 6 at age 12. Secondary education lasts from years 7-12, and study until year 10 is compulsory.</p>
<p>The final year of school in Vekllei usually includes a class trip overseas, traditionally to Europe or Asia, to celebrate graduation.</p>

<p>The Commonwealth invests heavily in tertiary education as both a social good and a product marketable overseas. Vekllei universities rank highly abroad, and education as a service is a major export of Vekllei, and contributes to Vekllei&rsquo;s reputation as an international capital of finance and skilled labour.</p>
<p>Universities in Vekllei offer places to students who have completed their Education Award and satisfy the prerequisites for their subject. These requirements differ between subjects, and usually include an interview with the admissions board.</p>
<p>In order to study abroad, Vekllei students must be sponsored by a foreigner, receive a partial scholarship from an overseas university, or receive funding from their tertiary place of study. About one in four Vekllei students study overseas for some period of time.</p>

<p>Although the items are not issued by individual schools, they are provided by the <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/commonwealth/education/#all-commonwealth-school-directorate">ACC</a> on request and as such constitute a uniform rather than a dress code. The uniform system was designed in 2015 by French migrant Charles-√âdouard Laurent to be accessible and comfortable, and so that individual items could continue to be worn after schooling concluded. It is iconic overseas and well-regarded by most Vekllei students.</p>
<p>Many schools make use of felt armbands to distinguish students or to signal membership in clubs or student councils. These are traditionally red, but may also be green or blue depending on their use.</p>

  <div class="text"><strong>Espionage</strong> is a considerable strength of the 4th Commonwealth, while also incurring a growing cost. Its assertive and risky operations, some of which have ended in catastrophe, inflict considerable damage on its image abroad, and isolate it from European and American powers. But this assertiveness has also built a fearsome, modern and sprawling intelligence network that meets or surpasses even that of much greater superpowers. Unsentimental, unideological and unflinching, espionage in Vekllei is conducted constantly and vigorously with the blessing &ndash; or at least willing blindness &ndash; of the state.</div>
</blockquote>

<p>Espionage in Vekllei is considered the &lsquo;first thorn&rsquo; of &lsquo;assertive defence&rsquo; practiced by the 4th Commonwealth. It is maintained offensively, as operations, and defensively as counterintelligence. The means by which it does are a source of endless contention in Commonwealth parliaments, the Vekllei public and foreign governments,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> but since independence in 2015 espionage has been conducted much the same &ndash; and so can be assumed to be achieving strategic goals.</p>
<p>Overseas strategic and industrial espionage primarily falls under the control of the Commonwealth National Intelligence Directorate, usually called Noshem, which maintains several subordinate bureaus organised regionally.</p>
<p>Current intelligence doctrine values &lsquo;signal operations&rsquo; &ndash; visible strategic actions that &lsquo;signal&rsquo; messages to public enemies of the Commonwealth state, and maintaining plausible deniability. The line between civilian and military intelligence operations is not always clear, and Noshem is implicated in assassinations and executions of state enemies overseas. The Vekllei intelligence community is known to recruit ideological and nationalist sympathisers to perform actions on behalf of the state, and to this end has among the largest networks of informants of any espionage ring in the world.</p>

<p>Noshem,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> the traditional name for the <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/commonwealth/security/#national-intelligence-directorate">National Intelligence Directorate</a> is the secret service of the Commonwealth and is responsible for most of its overseas espionage. It has a legendary reputation for the size and quality of its informants network, and is highly feared because of its history of ruthlessness, including extrajudicial assassinations and executions. Plausible deniability makes it difficult to tell how much of its work is sanctioned by parliaments or acted out by individual Vekllei people, and the organisation generates considerable controversy. Noshem has had several publicised tactical successes as well as failures, and is considered a critical aspect of Commonwealth security as a &lsquo;jewelled sabre&rsquo; of the non-aligned movement.</p>

In turn, Adsem supplies much of Noshem&rsquo;s mat√©riel, and many of its elite intelligence units are recruited from military commando and special forces sections. Adsem may also assist in the logistics of Noshem espionage operations.</p>

<p>Vekllei human intelligence is generally considered superior to that of the CIA, and may even be comparable to the KGB in scope and quality. Human intelligence is the basis of contemporary Vekllei intelligence-gathering, and the intelligence state gathers and processes massive amounts of information on foreign nationals, companies, and governments. It relies on enormous, concentric rings of highly motivated unpaid sympathisers that help Noshem in passing messages, inserting agents and obscuring information.</p>
<p>There are several classes of sympathiser &ndash; some are ideologically motivated in the anarchist or pan-Atlanticist tradition, factions which the Vekllei government is willing to recognise or indulge publicly to stir positive and negative press and distinguish itself from the cold war dichotomy. Others are nationalists who help out of a sense of devotion to Vekllei, since several million Vekllei people fled after the Atomic War. Although many returned in the years after independence, there remains a large Vekllei diaspora throughout the world and especially in the United States and Western Europe, and many members continue to hold a sense of duty towards the country.</p>
<p>This network of sympathisers is aided by Vekllei&rsquo;s postwar internationalism and multiracialism, emphasising political and geographic traits that appeal to young, educated people. Where duty fails, cash often suffices, and tremendous amounts of state funds are siphoned discretely from other Ministerial budgets to fund a network of paid informants. The total number of informants is impossible to know, but is estimated to number tens of thousands across the U.S., U.K., France, Russia, Yugoslavia, China and South-East Asia.</p>

  Overview
  <a class="anchor" href="#overview">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The colloquial turn-of-phrase for the domestic Vekllei economy is &ldquo;functionally moneyless,&rdquo; but the actual mechanisms of the internal Vekllei market is considerably more complex. While the average Vekllei person is insulated from money and money-management, their Commonwealth is a major entrep√¥t<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and has a reputation as an &ldquo;Atlantic Middleman.&rdquo; Vekllei&rsquo;s facilitation of frictionless free trade, large foreign-exchange reserves and received foreign direct investments have resulted in decades of consistent economic growth, and has cemented its reputation as a financial hub between Europe and the Americas.</p>
<p>Vekllei&rsquo;s history as a trade hub contributes significantly to its perceived neutrality and its reputation as a meeting place for politics and business, and regularly hosts diplomatic missions as a neutral site. It maintains its moneyless primary economy by effectively isolating its primary (<a href="#domestic-markets">domestic</a>) and secondary (<a href="#international-markets">international</a>) markets, which are the reason for its <a href="#currency">twin currencies</a> and its unusual hybrid market system. Because the Vekllei state manages all money as a function of its moneylessness, the international market and foreign trade is strongly characterised by dirigism and fundamentally beholden to the economic management of the <a href="/cosmosol/">Ministry of Commerce</a>, which acts as both a financial regulator and investment bank.</p>

<p>The Vekllei Domestic Market is the turn-of-phrase for the unmoneyed Vekllei economy, including almost all private and public businesses and the majority of trade conducted by ordinary Vekllei people. It is the primary market of Vekllei. For most Vekllei people, the domestic market is the only one with which they will interact in their lives, except for the occasional holiday overseas. The Domestic Market includes all sectors of the Vekllei economy except state trade apparatuses like <a href="#international-markets">VKIM</a>.</p>
<p>While the participatory nature of the Domestic Market affects its gross productivity, it is regarded as free, innovative and dynamic. It has a skilled workforce benefitted by a robust education system and a high quality of life. About 40% of Vekllei people were born overseas, and some 15% of the Vekllei workforce remain foreign workers. Foreign workers, unlike domestic ones, are remunerated unless residing under an immigration visa.</p>
<h3 id="industrial-markets">
  Industrial Markets
  <a class="anchor" href="#industrial-markets">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Vekllei Industrial Markets are distinguished by their ability to trade in both the moneyless <a href="#domestic-markets">Domestic Market</a> and the <a href="#international-markets">VKIM</a>. There are two kinds of industrial firm in Vekllei:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Senrouive</strong>: private enterprises</li>
<li><strong>Venrouive</strong>: public enterprises with membership in an industrial <a href="/bureaus/">bureau</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Venrouive</em> (also known as public companies in Vekllei) are enterprises beholden to <a href="/bureaus/">industrial bureaus</a>, which are collections of companies with close relations and hold membership in a shared industrial council. Venrouive businesses are characterised by large-scale enterprises, some of which may be state-owned, that hold considerable power over a market. In some cases, a bureau may monopolise a market, as in the case of the Vekllei telecommunications industry.</p>
<p>Both senrouive and venrouive companies may participate in the international market, but only bureaus (and by extension, participating venrouive companies) may trade directly with overseas governments and enterprises.</p>

<p>The Vekllei International Market (VKIM) is an organisation that controls the capital, commodities and securities markets of Vekllei. VKIM is maintained by the <a href="/cosmosol/">Ministry of Commerce</a> as a mechanism for foreign investors and merchants to interact with the isolated, unmoneyed Vekllei domestic market. The international market includes a commodities exchange, derivatives marketplace and other structured financial products that facilitate foreign activity in the Vekllei economy and raise foreign capital for the national liquid currency reserves. VKIM uses the Vekllei Composite Index as a measure of the Vekllei economy, which measures both commodity value and productivity.</p>
<p>The International Market is the means by which the capital account<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> of the Commonwealth Government implements its long-standing macroeconomic interest in foreign investment and soft power. The reinvestment of capital surplus in the <a href="#currency">Vekllei currencies</a> serves as a form of sterilisation and capital control, controlled directly by the central <a href="#bank-of-vekllei">Bank of Vekllei</a>. Vekllei has the world&rsquo;s 2nd-largest foreign currency reserves.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Vekllei has two currencies that are more or less opposed in their use as money, known as the twin crowns system. The Vekllei Crown (‚ù¶VK) is a gold-backed, fixed-rate deflationary currency used primarily as a wealth reserve, and the Government Crown (‚úæAK) is a fiat, floating-exchange currency used for foreign investment and trade. This system preserves the isolation of the Vekllei primary economy, which is moneyless, while insulating state investments from shocks and from having to burn liquidity to maintain its exchange rate.</p>
<p>Together, the twin crowns allow for the Vekllei state to retain unprecedented control over its financial system while securing a mechanism for foreign investment and growth.</p>
<ul>
<li>The domestic market is autarkic and does not have free capital exchange, allowing it to maintain its fixed price and independent monetary policy</li>
<li>The international market is open and has free capital exchange, facilitated by ‚úæAK floating exchange price with policy independence maintained by capital controls from the <a href="/cosmosol/">Ministry of Commerce</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a variety of political and economic reasons, the Vekllei Commonwealth state aims to be self-sufficient. The twin crowns system provides a means to isolate its productive primary economy while also allowing foreign money controlled access to it. The unmoneyed primary economy remains a popular investment for its stability.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> As capital controls have broken down in the mid-2030s, Vekllei&rsquo;s current macroeconomic policy exists as a &ldquo;third way&rdquo; between closed autarky and recent trends towards an open economic international market.</p>

  Vekllei Crown (‚ù¶VK)
  <a class="anchor" href="#vekllei-crown-vk">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The <em>Vekllei Kroner</em> (lit. <em>Vekllei Crown</em>) is the primary and historic currency of Vekllei. It is minted by the <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/interior/commerce/#national-mint-of-vekllei">National Mint</a> as a souvenir in the tradition of Vekllei <em>medals</em>,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> but is not otherwise used by Vekllei people as money or transacted in day-to-day life. It is primarily a deflationary currency store backed by gold, and to which each Vekllei citizen is entitled an equal share in emigration. It is not able to be used on the <a href="#international-markets">VKIM</a> directly, but can be purchased as a <a href="#white-bonds">White Bond</a> as a speculative instrument. It is also used in some cases as a mechanism for trade with individuals abroad, mostly by smaller banks looking to broker purchases of goods or services unavailable in Vekllei.</p>
<h3 id="government-crown-ak">
  Government Crown (‚úæAK)
  <a class="anchor" href="#government-crown-ak">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The <em>Government/Commonwealth Kroner</em> (also the <em>Atlantic Kroner</em> or <em>Crown</em>) is a twin currency used primarily by the state to insure financial instruments like bonds as well as for converting and placing foreign investments and currency. The Government Crown operates on a floating exchange rate as a fiat currency tradeable in the <a href="#international-markets">VKIM</a> and a means for overseas actions in the Vekllei economy.</p>
<p>The ‚úæAK is not minted as it does not resemble a conventional currency, and exists only in bonds, state certificates, and as a metric for some commodity money. It has a strong reputation as a hard currency because of the ‚úæAK&rsquo;s relative security and reliability, backed by powerful domestic institutions.</p>

<p>The policy of bank consolidation under the British Occupation Government continued under the successive Floral Government, and banking was among the first industries in Vekllei to be completely socialised.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> All banks in Vekllei are run as state-owned enterprises, and subordinated to the &lsquo;<em>Old Lady</em>,&rsquo; the colloquial name for the central <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/interior/commerce/#bank-of-vekllei">Bank of Vekllei</a>. &lsquo;Unbanking&rsquo; policy &ndash; the effective demonetisation of the Vekllei domestic markets &ndash; saw severe disruption to the Vekllei economy and led to a period of hyperinflation in the late 2010s.</p>
<p>Unlike in other countries, the socialisation of banking in Vekllei also saw the broad exclusion of retail investors and savings banking, effectively halting money exchange in the domestic market and institutionalising the Vekllei banking system. Today, most Vekllei banks are institutional and deal primarily with the secondary speculative markets like <a href="#international-markets">VKIM</a>, or provide lending and contracts for new businesses in the <a href="#industrial-markets">industrial market</a>.</p>

<p>The Bank of Vekllei (also <em>Labour Bank of Vekllei</em> and <em>Old Lady</em>) is Vekllei&rsquo;s central bank with a constitutionally-granted monopoly on the financial mechanisms of the Commonwealth, with nearly all Commonwealth banking firms subordinated to its organisation. It is responsible directly to the <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/interior/commerce/">Ministry of Commerce</a> and sets the monetary policy of Vekllei. It is primarily a macroeconomic institution that does not deal directly with the primary or secondary markets, but does over institutional banking services and complex financing for some markets in the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Despite the functional moneylessness of the Commonwealth, banks do facilitate financial transactions with the common Vekllei person. Aside from its policy features (like holiday allowances and emigration stipends), most trade arrangements operate in the bank system, usually through the <em>Sisterbank</em>. Sisterbank (formally the <em>Petty Bank of Vekllei</em>) is a merchant bank that specialises in industrial brokerage, allowing small businesses to trade with others and stimulate economic activity. Vekllei persons looking to start a restaurant, workshop or store generally do so through the Sisterbank, which assigns a bank agent and enters the business in its internal market ledger. Not all small business in Vekllei is conducted through the an agent, but certain types of industries (particularly businesses involved in manufacturing) are almost all banked with Sisterbank.</p>
<p>In addition to government banks, money bureaus (also <em>Money Unions</em>) are a form of cooperative credit union premised on private business associations and securitised lending, and are common in Vekllei agriculture.</p>

<p>Investment banking is provided primarily by the Commonwealth Bank of Vekllei (COMMBANK), which offers placement and settling services for <a href="/bureaus/">bureaus</a> seeking to engage with the International market. COMMBANK also arranges debt financing, underwriting and distribution services for overseas partners. COMMBANK also serves as the central bank of the Kalina Isles. In addition, the Bank of Vekllei maintains several subsidiaries dedicated to special financial products, like low-interest domestic infrastructure financing or overseas trade and investment.</p>

</h3>
<p>What we know as the &lsquo;Vekllei Government&rsquo; is portioned between several powerful state bodies, each representing the natural political concerns of the modern Vekllei state. These bodies are both autonomous and codependent, carving the sovereignty and authority of the state across several governing organs of varying size and scope. These are, in order of sovereignty:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Palace of the Vekllei Sovereign</strong>, the metaphysical manifestation of all Vekllei territory and its collective geographic, cultural and religious features. It represents the cumulative historical essence of the physical place of Vekllei, and bridges relationships between humans, nature and spirits. The Palace, as representative of the land itself, is the true sovereign of Vekllei and as such retains control over the armed forces of the Commonwealth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Parliaments of the Vekllei Commonwealth</strong> including, in order of authority:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Crown Parliament (also the <em>Crown Sovereign</em>, <em>Parliament of Spirits</em> and <em>Administration of the Crown</em> interchangeably), representing the rule of the Land Sovereign and its presence in the state.</li>
<li>The Commonwealth Parliament (also the <em>Administration of the Commonwealth</em>), responsible for the maintenance, development and security of the Vekllei Commonwealth, including its territories.</li>
<li>The Interior Parliaments (also the <em>Administrations of the Interior</em> interchangeably), responsible for the internal governance of the Vekllei member-states, primarily used in reference to the interior parliaments of the Vekllei Home Islands.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Under this arrangement, it is clear that the sovereignty of Vekllei and its Commonwealth members is somewhat obfuscated &ndash; the Crown, Commonwealth and Interior administrations all share overlapping <em>de jure</em> control over the affairs of Vekllei territories. In addition, the word &lsquo;Vekllei,&rsquo; commonly used to refer to the Vekllei Home Islands, is also used interchangeably to describe states beyond its geography. For example, the &lsquo;Vekllei Commonwealth&rsquo; in fact refers to membership in the Crown, of which Vekllei is an equal member but does not otherwise, in principle, control as a legal metropole. The Kalina Islands, Kala, Demon and other full members of the Commonwealth are equal autonomous members, but nonetheless inherit the Vekllei name.</p>
<p>In this state of affairs, Vekllei can refer to the powerful member-state in the North Atlantic, the Commonwealth it belongs to, or, indeed, the Crown Sovereign itself. Unfortunately for foreigners, its use is generally dependent on context.</p>

<p>The Government of Vekllei is divided between three parliaments &ndash; the <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/interior">Interior Parliament</a>, the <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/commonwealth">Commonwealth Parliament</a> and the <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/crown/">Crown Parliament</a>. Neither is particularly subordinate to the other, and they serve different purposes in the lives of Vekllei people.</p>
<p>In general, the Interior Parliament is responsible for the standard of living in the Vekllei Home Islands and dependent autonomous regions like Demon and the Aismious islands. The Commonwealth Parliament is responsible for all features of the transnational Commonwealth superstate, standardising governance and state services while advocating for &lsquo;Floral Society&rsquo; under the Floral Constitution.</p>
<p>Together, these two parliaments make up the combined Government of Vekllei. It is made up of Ministries, Offices, Departments, Bureaus, Commissions, Directorates and Secretariats depending on the size, purpose and structure of the state body. This is the government that people living in the Vekllei Home Islands vote for, via the nonpartisan representatives system.</p>

<p>The <em>Administration of the Interior of the Government of Vekllei</em> (also known as the <em>Interior Government</em> or <em>Interior Parliament</em>) represents the human state of the Vekllei Home Islands, as well as its dependent possessions. It includes all 100 <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/">boroughs</a> of the Home Islands and its peripheral island possessions. Independent Commonwealth member-states Demon and Aismious lack the population to govern themselves independently, and so are dependent on the Interior Government. Other members of the Commonwealth, including Kalina, Kala and Mira, have parliaments (also called Interior Administrations) similar to the Vekllei Administration of the Interior.</p>
<p>The Interior Government is made up of 10 ministries which retain total authority over the state in Vekllei.</p>

<p>Although each member of the Atlantic Commonwealth is considered a full participant of equal importance, administration in practice occurs in the <a href="/factbook/vekllei/">Vekllei Islands</a>, its most populous and industrious member state.

<p>The <em>Commonwealth Administration of the Crown</em> (also the Crown Sovereign and Parliament of Spirits interchangeably), not to be confused with the <a href="/factbook/society/government/#palace-of-the-vekllei-sovereign">Palace of the Vekllei Sovereign</a>, is the administration-level apparatus of the Commonwealth to coordinate policy with the Palace. Since the Commonwealth does not have direct authority over the features of the Sovereign, the Crown Parliament acts as its human representative in Vekllei government. Although it sits above the Commonwealth and Interior parliaments in sovereignty, its responsibilities are limited to constitutional matters and aspects of the Vekllei legal system.

</blockquote>

<p>All real estate in Vekllei is negotiated, purchased and leased at a <a href="/municipalities/">municipal</a> level. This system depends heavily on stewardship as a factor of ownership. Most free homes are rented on an open market and are awarded via an interview process with the municipality, though there are many exceptions. In general, the more time a resident spends working a property, the more powerful their claim to ownership becomes. In this sense, multigenerational family homes are nearly impossible to challenge in the delicture courts.</p>
<p>As part of <a href="/metaphysics/">Vekllei metaphysics</a>, land has rights and owns itself. Human ownership is foremost a contract with the land, and the municipality is positioned as an intermediary. In practice, land ownership is portioned between different agents based on their relationship with the property. The municipality may retain a monopoly on real estate, but most Vekllei people own their residences. All residences are designed by architects, who are an essential agent of the municipality in Vekllei.</p>
<p>Real estate is also used as <a href="/news/essays/moneylessness/#why-do-vekllei-people-work">compensation</a>. Doctors are usually housed close to their place of work in homes built for that purpose. Tenancy in Vekllei is generally of this type, where homes are tied to employment. In the Vekllei delicture system, longtime employees gradually wrest ownership away from the municipality, and homes are commonly gifted after ten or fifteen years of service.</p>

  Overview
  <a class="anchor" href="#overview">#</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Vekllei language</strong>, abbreviated to just <strong>Vekllei</strong>, has six core sublanguages that are used commonly today. Although they often intersect, these different systems of communication are distinct languages in their own right, used for different purposes in different arenas of communication.</p>
<details open>
  <summary>Systems of Vekllei Language</summary>
  <div class="markdown-inner">
    <ol>
<li><strong>Spoken Vekllei</strong>, which is everyday spoken language. It draws from two glossaries with different meanings and feelings, called <em>Oa</em> and <em>Loh</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Topet</strong>, which are logographic characters (occasionally characterised as hieroglyphs). Like other pictographic languages, <em>Topet</em> characters can be broken down into repeating components, called <em>Topotte</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Rapotenne</strong>, is the traditional logographic language of names. It is much older than Topet, and has more in common with spiritual runes than modern logography.</li>
<li><strong>Potenne</strong>, lit. ‚Äú<em>Hand-Talk</em>‚Äù, is a sign language that incorporates gestures and signing to add meaning to emotion to spoken language, and occasionally in place of it.</li>
<li><strong>Upotenne</strong>, lit. ‚Äú<em>Spirit-Hand-Talk</em>‚Äù, as the recreation of runes in human form, used limitedly in spiritual ritual.</li>
<li><strong>Vekllei Semaphore</strong> is the codification of colour and shape. Traditionally limited to colour, shape and pattern are now also included in <em>Vekllei Semaphore</em>, in which full sentences can be formed.</li>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look in more detail about how each aspect of the Vekllei language operates in daily life. With six recognised language, Vekllei is unique in its complexity and multidimensionality, appropriating a variety of scripts, glossaries, alphabets and physical components. Literacy in the country is very high, and <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language/#spoken-vekllei"><em>Spoken Vekllei</em></a> and <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language/#topet"><em>Topet</em></a> are understood universally.</p>

<p>Other languages, often called <em>sub-languages</em>, are informed regionally and have varying literacy across the Home Island. For example, <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language/#upotenne"><em>Upotenne</em></a> is employed frequently in rural and agrarian communities, where religious ritual requires its frequent practice. This passage introduces the broad characteristics of each sub-language, which together form contemporary Vekllei, one of the world&rsquo;s most complex and hermetic language systems.</p>

  <div class="text"><strong>Spoken Vekllei</strong>, simply referred to as Vekllei domestically, is the common spoken language of Vekllei and official language of the country, spoken by some 25 million people worldwide, with 98% of speakers living natively in the Vekllei Home Islands. It is the first spoken language of the vast majority of the population, and has minor variance across the disparate Vekllei Home Islands and other Vekllei possessions. It is rarely spoken outside of Vekllei territories, extant abroad only through emigrant populations and small diasporic communities dispersed after the Atomic War.</div>
</blockquote>

<p>Contemporary spoken Vekllei is largely descended from <em>Proto-Islandi</em> speech that arrived with the first Danish settlers in the country, but includes <em>Kalaallisut</em> and Proto-Algic reconstructions of an early extinct language called <em>Kala</em>. Modern spoken Vekllei has heritage in the combined, largely extinct language hybrid of Algic-Aleutian <em>Quutetast</em> and the Indo-European <em>Islandi,</em> which by the 9th century had fused into common speech usually called <em>Topyas</em>, or &lsquo;Old Speech&rsquo;/&lsquo;Old Vekllei&rsquo;. Modern Vekllei has evolved distinctively since the Atomic War as part of broader sociological trends towards informalised speech and cultivated <em>Loh</em> vocabularies.</p>
<h3 id="twin-glossaries">
  Twin Glossaries
  <a class="anchor" href="#twin-glossaries">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Spoken Vekllei draws from two glossaries, called <em>Oa</em> and <em>Loh</em>. These glossaries date back to twin reconstructed Algic-Aleutian languages called <em>Quutetast</em> and <em>Islandi</em> that had been present in earlier forms since at least 1200BC. The glossaries were formalised in pagan ritual that would become present-day <a href="/factbook/vekllei/religion"><em>Upen</em></a>, and later recognised as the official language of the country in the reformation initiated by Queen Souisviasn in the 3rd century.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5 id="oa-lit-sun">
  Oa (<em>lit.</em> Sun)
  <a class="anchor" href="#oa-lit-sun">#</a>
</h5>
<em>Oa</em> is considered to have &lsquo;permanent&rsquo; traits. It is often characterised abroad as a positive glossary, though this is not true &ndash; it is in fact dedicated to inanimate and unliving organs. Although Vekllei does not gender nouns, this glossary is often gendered conceptually as masculine, and is most commonly associated with Summer and Spring. Despite its long history, Vekllei as an island is itself understood to be female &ndash; mostly because its volcanic landscape, which straddles two drifting continental plates, is constantly changing.</li>
<li>
<h5 id="loh-lit-moon">
  Loh (<em>lit.</em> Moon)
  <a class="anchor" href="#loh-lit-moon">#</a>
</h5>
<em>Loh</em> is considered to have &lsquo;cyclical&rsquo; traits. Loh words are largely derived from Old Vekllei (including <em>Icelandic/Islandi</em>), and so its glossary is considerably less defined and dependent on older linguistic artefacts. <em>Loh</em> words incorporate sounds and grammatical artefacts from extinct languages within Vekllei&rsquo;s ancient history, and so it is often associated with traditional or formal speech. It is commonly gendered as feminine, and is associated with winter and autumn.</li>
</ul>
<p>In modernity, this binary produces bizarre psycholinguistic quirks. For example, a sailing vessel (<em>Siv</em>) is derived from the <em>Oa</em>, historically because the <em>Oa</em> glossary was favoured for machines between the 10th and 16th Centuries. This genders all modern oceangoing vessels as male figures to this day, and due to <em>Siv</em>&rsquo;s linguistic derivatives, ties ships permanently to the lumber and woodlands critical to wooden shipbuilding. From the 20th century onwards, however, most vehicles are regarded impermanent through <em>Loh</em>, and so all cars in Vekllei are conceptually female.</p>
<h3 id="phonology">
  Phonology
  <a class="anchor" href="#phonology">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Spoken Vekllei is phonologically homogenous, and has little variation in accent or pronunciation across the Home Island or its various possessions, although there is some evidence for differences in dialect between cultivated speech on the coast and rural phonology in the interior of the Home Islands.</p>

<p>Individual <em>Topet</em> characters are both phonograms and semagrams, and so they support multiple readings. Many are basically figurative, and represent conceptually what they depict. Each character conforms to an abugida-type system, in which consonant-vowel pairings are written in joined notation. In <em>Topet</em>, the consonant anchors the pairing, which is called <em>Lohtopet</em>, and vowel notation is usually raised in superscript, called <em>Oatopet</em>. These names are not related to the binary glossary, but do represent the upper/lower system those glossaries imply. &ldquo;Oa&rdquo; means <em>affirmative</em> in Vekllei, and <em>Loh</em> is a negating form, so their use is widespread beyond the binary glossary system.</p>

<p>Anchoring consonant-vowel characters (<em>demioette</em>, as opposed to double-vowels or vowel-consonants, called <em>hieyerette</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>) written in Topet may feature redundant adjacent characters called <em>phonetic complements</em>, which, in a non-determinative reading, are pronounced the same way to guide the reader. This lends to a system that encourages adjacent duplicate consonant-vowel pairings in some aspects, since Vekllei words are already formed out of neosyllabic pairings and it is immediately obvious which characters are to be read. The word for friend, <em>comoyia</em>, can thus sometimes be transliterated into c-c-c<sup>o</sup>m-m<sup>o</sup>y<sup>ia</sup>, which can affect the conceptual meanings of a word through the figurative placement of its characters as well as help guide the reader through the use of multiple phonetically identical, though visually distinct, characters.</p>
<p>In the above case, <em>comoyia</em> can be affected by the composition of its phonetic complements, if any are used at all. There is a default reading, which combines both semantic and phonetic readings for meaning and is generally recognised as the dictionary &lsquo;spelling&rsquo; of the word, but this can be manipulated through the addition of semantically different, but identically phonetic characters to shade and change meaning. The word for an untrustworthy friend is also <em>comoyia</em>, but combines the characters for snake with the dictionary spelling, which produces a transliteration similar to c-c<sup>o</sup>m<sup>o</sup>y<sup>ia</sup>. In spoken Vekllei, this distinction is only communicable through the aid of <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language/#potenne"><em>Potenne</em></a>, and represents one of its primary uses.</p>
<h3 id="semantic-reading">
  Semantic Reading
  <a class="anchor" href="#semantic-reading">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Many <em>Topet</em> characters are figurative; they represent their meanings pictographically, like Egyptian <em>Hieroglyphs</em> or Chinese <em>Hanzi</em>. In Vekllei, this is considered an evolved rune-form, and ties into a broader conceptualisation of language as a <em>transcendental</em>, rather than <em>literal</em> system. Although <em>Topet</em>&rsquo;s early form, <em>Hieyeric</em>, was explicitly pictographic, modern <em>Topet</em> is often abstracted and decoupled from its figurative meaning via the phonetic system.</p>
<p>Despite common use of the phonetic system in modernity, the semantic readings of characters are taught and essential for literacy beyond literal imitation of speech. For the vast majority of <em>Topet</em> characters, their logographic meaning determines their pronunciation, and consonant characters especially depend on this meaning to form words. The word for breakfast is <em>petimourgeneur</em>, but it cannot be written with random literal phonetic characters; parts of the word depend on the figurative meaning of certain components, and so without its semantic traits the word would be illegible to most people. This represents a wider co-dependency on simultaneous phonetic and semantic readings of words, with the importance of each fluctuating depending on the word in question. Older words tend to be heavily figurative, whereas modern and loan words are often more phonetic. This inconsistency is part of the difficulty in learning <em>Topet</em>, and leaves many immigrants fluent in speech but inadequately literate in reading and writing.</p>

<p>Individual <em>Topet</em> characters are both semantic and phonetic, and can be written in a phonetic abugida (with semantic weight carried by the initial character-group) or as a single character group. The abugida-form is phonetic and aids vocalisation through its <em>hieyerette</em> characters. The single character group-form is pictographic, and generally replaces the abugida in contexts where the pronunciation is commonly known or obvious. In these character groups, only one <em>demioette</em> character is vocalised, called the <em>principle</em>, and the <em>hieyerette</em> characters are simply not written.</p>

<p>These character groups are called <em>Minor Demons</em>, or <em>pettidemion,</em> and change appearance depending on the number of characters in its group. One character occupies a quarter-height space in the centre of a line. Two characters are written in an adjacent quarter-height space, with the principle arranged to the left. Three characters are arranged in a triangle, with the principle arranged at the top. Four characters, the maximum in modern <em>Topet</em>, are arranged in a quadrant with the principle arranged in the top left.</p>
<p><em>Minor Demons</em> are the foundations of <em>Topet</em> script, since they can be written phonetically or as pictographs. This also contributes to <em>Topet</em>&rsquo;s unusual linguistic structure, in which single words are modified heavily and often come to resemble sentences with self-contained adjectives.</p>

  <div class="text"><strong>Rapotenne</strong> (<em>lit. &ldquo;Name-Talk&rdquo;</em>) is the Vekllei system of names, often considered in modernity to function as a distinct, though limited, language. Today, it is most often employed as an extant language of magical staves, but is closely aligned phonologically and ethnographically with <em>Upotenne</em>, the physical language of rune-forms and sigils.</div>
</blockquote>

<p>Contemporary <em>Rapotenne</em> is informed by pictographic proto-<em>Topet</em> runes as well as elements of the extinct <em>Kala</em> language, and subsequently <em>Quutetast</em> Algic artefacts. Because <em>Kala</em> is extinct and <em>Quutetast</em> is a dead language, largely displaced by modern spoken Vekllei, <em>Rapotenne</em> is unique among Vekllei&rsquo;s sublanguages for its direct lineage from proto-linguistic forms of early Vekllei history, some nearly 4,000 years old. Today it is used largely ceremonially, through ritual related to birth and Blood Names.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Rapotenne</em> has its origins in superstitious <em>Islandi</em> magical staves, sigils which evolved into battle names and honourifics, called Blood Names. The use of Blood Names varies across Vekllei history, but is still common across ancestral families today. In modern immigration, especially after the Atomic War and British occupation, Blood Names have been commonly adopted by new families as symbolic displacement of older bloodlines, largely for their fashionable association with royalty and heritage. <em>Rapotenne</em> today mostly employs older <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language/#diphthongs">Floral Vowels</a>, which themselves are likely evolutions of proto-<em>Quutetast</em> pronunciation associated with <em>Kala</em>. Rapotenne characters, also called <em>Rapotenne</em>, are closely associated with old runic Islandi sigils, and are purely figurative. Their use in modernity is largely instructional, and is used to determine and act out <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language/#upotenne"><em>Upotenne</em></a> signs, which is functionally adjacent to <em>Rapotenne</em>.</p>
<h3 id="practice">
  Practice
  <a class="anchor" href="#practice">#</a>
</h3>
<p><em>Rapotenne</em> consists of 452 characters in common practice, although priests and regional dialects may employ upwards of 1,000. Despite integration with the formal Vekllei language constellation, minor differences in pronunciation survive. For example, the Alveolar /sÕá/ is dropped before consonants in ordinary spoken Vekllei, making it rare in modern usage, but is voiced in <em>Rapotenne</em>. The shape and stroke order of characters determines the physicality of <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language/#upotenne"><em>Upotenne</em></a>, as their function within ritual is more or less the same. Although simplistic and literally figurative, <em>Rapotenne</em> is used extensively in religious script and poetry, and remains an important cultural force within Vekllei.</p>

  <div class="text"><strong>Potenne</strong> (<em>lit. &ldquo;Hand-Talk&rdquo;</em>) is an indigenous auxiliary sign language in Vekllei used commonly today as an aid or substitute for vocalised speech.

</blockquote>

<p>Historic social taboos in Vekllei&rsquo;s dominant religion, Upen, prevented speech between people for a variety of reasons, including for marital, interfamilial, penal and ascetic considerations. <em>Potenne</em> first arose to avoid these taboos. During the first substantial immigration of Inuit-Kalaallisut peoples in the 4th century BC, proto-<em>Potenne</em> avoidance languages developed pragmatic pidgin forms to allow for trade and communication between settlers and the original Islandi population. This rapid expansion in use saw <em>Potenne</em> develop solidified cultural tenants, including phonologically distinct suprasegmental components like <em>biouspotenne</em> (<em>lit. &ldquo;Face-Talk&rdquo;</em>), which distinguishes facial expression from gestures in poetic, transcendental forms, and <em>kiouyapotenne</em> (<em>lit. &ldquo;Child-Talk&rdquo;</em>), which uses facial expressions to teach children individual signs.</p>
<p>By the 11th Century, <em>Potenne</em> was documented alongside other critical languages like <em>Topet</em>, and had demonstrated its saturation of Vekllei society in several sociological and cultural forms, including <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language/#upotenne"><em>Upotenne</em></a>, today considered an independent language system within Vekllei&rsquo;s varied linguistic cultures.</p>
<p><em>Potenne</em> is used today as a casual substitute for simple speech and to communicate figurative meanings of words in <em>Topet</em> otherwise uncommunicable in conventional speech.</p>
<h3 id="phonology-1">
  Phonology
  <a class="anchor" href="#phonology-1">#</a>
</h3>
<p>It is important to remember that <em>Potenne</em> is not simply a reproduction of ordinary speech in physical form; it is a language that assists the spoken word. Many Vekllei words can be simplified by incorporating <em>Potenne</em>, which better mimics nonverbal components of <em>Topet</em> and helps provide emotion and context to otherwise ambiguous phrases. In other cases, it replaces speech entirely, often in quiet areas or out of respect in public transit. In this sense, <em>Potenne</em> retains a handful of the characteristics inherited from its origins as an avoidance language, but remains distinct from both spoken Vekllei and <em>Topet</em> in its capacity to link and colour both.</p>
<h4 id="location">
  Location
  <a class="anchor" href="#location">#</a>
</h4>
<p>Most <em>Potenne</em> is acted out just below the chest, in a casual resting position. Positional and place-based signs are performed at the right shoulder, and emotion is often acted out at or just below the chin. Regional traits and dialects are common, and <em>Potenne</em> is perhaps Vekllei&rsquo;s most provincial and least documented language.</p>
<h4 id="movement">
  Movement
  <a class="anchor" href="#movement">#</a>
</h4>
<p>Upen signs are generally simple, and practiced quickly and casually. The direction of the fore and ring fingers generally indicate subject, and the position of the thumb indicates tone ‚Äî an outstretched thumb is casual whereas a thumb tucked inwards appears formal. Common words use simple, single-handed signs, but complete sentences and more complex words almost always require the use of both hands.</p>
<h4 id="orientation">
  Orientation
  <a class="anchor" href="#orientation">#</a>
</h4>
<p>Communication in the your own voice is performed with the hand held horizontally with few exceptions. Quoting speech and reading is most often spoken with the hand held vertically, although this varies between dialects. Various orientations incorporate meaning, including casual affirmation and some emotions.</p>
<h4 id="handshape">
  Handshape
  <a class="anchor" href="#handshape">#</a>
</h4>
<p>Most signs are communicated with an open palm, although fists, hooked fingers, clenched fingers and relaxation of fingers are also used in various ways. Most common <em>Potenne</em> words are characterised by their informal, almost lazy composition, and so handshape is particularly gestural, often dependent on vocalised context to be legible. It can be difficult to determine within <em>Potenne</em> a clear distinction between non-linguistic gestural communication and its formalised language system, and so the emotiveness and context of its signs are critical to literacy in Vekllei.</p>

  <div class="text"><strong>Upotenne</strong> (<em>lit. &ldquo;Spirit-Hand-Talk&rdquo;</em>) is the nonverbal sign language of religious ritual in Vekllei. Although adjacent to <em>Potenne</em>, <em>Upotenne</em> is more closely historically aligned with <em>Rapotenne</em> than modern Vekllei.</div>
</blockquote>

<p>Much as <em>Potenne</em> combines semantic and verbal forms to enhance communication, <em>Upen</em> appropriates the older pictographic <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language/#rapotenne"><em>Rapotenne</em></a> script to aid spiritual ritual and <em>demiosnjarnkah</em> (<em>lit. &ldquo;Old Arts&rdquo;</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>). Although few Vekllei people are completely literate in it, <em>Upotenne</em> remains a cultural force throughout society and is used commonly in ritual around the Home Islands.</p>
<p><em>Upotenne</em> is characterised as a sign language in keeping with the traditions in <em>Potenne</em>, but also incorporates complex cultural artefacts unique to <em>Upen</em> within its symbolism as a language. It codifies the human form and reproduces it in a spiritual manner, assigning importance and symbolism to parts of the human body ignored by the secular <em>Potenne</em>. Where much of the communication in <em>Potenne</em> is dependent on hand-based signs and gestures, <em>Upotenne</em> is mostly positional, using joints and angles to imitate rune-forms. These type and imitation of rune-forms vary greatly between different parts of Vekllei society, since literacy is dependent on landscape; rural persons will most likely recognise and communicate runes that benefit harvest and weather, where urban persons are more likely to participate in ceremonies to benefit employment or love.</p>
<p>This multidimensionality means that <em>Upotenne</em> is uniquely dependent on place and circumstance, as Vekllei people learn and dispense with signs that benefit their circumstance. Despite <em>Upotenne</em>&rsquo;s capacity as a language, it is largely displaced by its use as a spiritual adjacent to <em>Potenne</em> in modern society, leaving only <em>Upen</em> priests and disciples fluent in one of Vekllei&rsquo;s oldest cultural traditions.</p>

In this sense, <em>Vekllei Semaphore</em> can be considered to be <em>asemic</em>, since it has no material semantic meaning and is entirely illegible without instruction.</div>
</blockquote>

<p>It is most commonly used to enhance <em>Topet</em> and communicate in public spaces, through stationary, flags, banners, painted lines, stylised infrastructure and clothing as shorthand for established <em>Topet</em> phrases. Its association with media like television and illustration has caused some ethnographers to suggest Vekllei Semaphore as sign of evolving postliteracy<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> in Vekllei, as modern systems of media and communication make it easier for people to go without reading or writing day-to-day.</p>
<p><em>Vekllei lo da Myaiouisvah</em> originated in the early 17th century in the navy, where it was largely informed by <em>Upotenne</em>. It had an obvious practical purpose in communication between oceangoing vessels, but later saw general use among ordinary people as Vekllei developed, evolving into a sort of natural industrial sister language of <em>Rapotenne</em>.</p>
<p>By the 19th Century, <em>Vekllei Semaphore</em> had lost a lot of its original connotations with military pragmatism and had started to evolve and establish itself in different roles in society, fuelled by an emerging aesthetic interest in bloodlines and colonial enterprise. Colour and formless symbolism quickly took on new meaning as a way of distinguishing class and education across the country in highly fashionable shifts in culture. As the colonial machine of Vekllei&rsquo;s late monarchy and early junta developed a sprawling bureaucracy and civil service, these meanings were codified and later formalised as the language of the empire. It was rapidly revitalised during Vekllei&rsquo;s independence from British occupation after the First Atomic War, and is the youngest and fastest-developing of Vekllei&rsquo;s languages. It remains a unique cultural phenomenon among developed countries today.</p>
<p><em>Vekllei Semaphore</em> is most useful in public, shared space as a form of mass-communication. Its relative universality within the country means that many public-facing organisations and concerns employ it as a sort of &lsquo;shared symbolism;&rsquo; an unspoken democratic language used in shared spaces and common forums.</p>
<h3 id="symbolism">

<h4 id="colourcoda">
  Colourcoda
  <a class="anchor" href="#colourcoda">#</a>
</h4>
<p><em>Colourcoda</em> is the means by which <em>Vekllei Semaphore</em> reassembles colour values in social forms through patterns, colour placement and contrast. Visitors will likely have encountered <em>Colourcoda</em> without even realising it; the transliteration of green and gold on <a href="/images/uniform.jpg">the uniforms of Puffin Scouts</a> is &ldquo;peacefulness besides the land;&rdquo; the red and white of <a href="/images/trials.jpg">the Vekllei school uniform</a> means &ldquo;youth of Vekllei,&rdquo; and <a href="/images/feast.jpg">the blue and white of a Venopor police car</a> means &ldquo;royal defence&rdquo;. Patterns quickly complexify this meaning, allowing for more sophisticated sentence construction, though few Vekllei people are fluent.</p>
<h4 id="formsigns">
  Formsigns
  <a class="anchor" href="#formsigns">#</a>
</h4>
<p><em>Formsigns</em> are the means by which <em>Vekllei Semaphore</em> encodes meaning in shape. Vekllei (as a landscape) is depicted by a circle within the <em>Loh</em> glossary, and an arched point in the <em>Oa</em> glossary. These forms are adjacent to pictographics, but <em>formsigns</em> can also be totally abstracted. The borders on stationary and envelopes, for example, contain specific meaning when joined with specific colours. This concept saturates Vekllei society &ndash; title cards in television, armbands, pinstripes, aircraft livery and basic shapes can all produce phonetic recognition in Vekllei people depending on their context and use.</p>
<h4 id="semaphore">
  Semaphore
  <a class="anchor" href="#semaphore">#</a>
</h4>
<p>Flags are used heavily in Vekllei semaphore, but are distinct from traditional semaphore systems through their use and appearance. Semaphore within <em>da Myaiouisvah</em> share more in common with <em>Upotenne</em> than they do alphabetic semaphore, and are largely figurative of extant runes. Flags are also very common objects that incorporate <em>formsigns</em> and <em>colourcoda,</em> and used frequently within Vekllei as means of communication. Festivals, companies and bureaus all use their own flags as means of identifying and communicating in public space.</p>

<p><strong>The Royal Mail of Vekllei</strong>, referred to as the <strong>Mail</strong> or <strong>Mail A.r.</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> within the country, is the national postal carrier of <a href="/factbook/vekllei">Vekllei</a>. It is a military state requisite reponsible for all postage in the country, and delivers nearly 50 million mail pieces domestically and abroad each day. One of the oldest institutions of its kind in Vekllei, it was founded in 1422 as a courier system between the Vekllei Kingdom and its largely mercenary military force. In 1742, it was formalised as a modern postal system available to the civilian public, and today offers a variety of services available to all Vekllei residents, including external territories.</p>
<p>Vekllei is also home to the U.N. Universal Postal Union, the body responsible for coordinating international postage, of which Vekllei is a signatory.</p>

<p>The Mail is old enough to have its own hieroglyph in <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language/#3-topet"><em>Topet</em></a>, which has resulted in the somewhat misleading transliteration of its name. In Vekllei, it is simply called the &lsquo;Mail&rsquo;, since its written name includes both its royal and national meanings intrinsically. Abroad, this is usually translated as the Royal Mail of Vekllei, but this is in fact more of a description of the organisation than its proper name.</p>
<p>Since Vekllei refers to its territory as its sovereign (expressed commonly as the &lsquo;Landscape Sovereign&rsquo;), the Mail remains Royal even today, centuries after the collapse of the monarchy that founded it. Despite its regular function as a postal service, it is nonetheless considered a resource of landscape, not a government department, and so it remains &ldquo;the Royal Mail of Vekllei&rdquo; in the 21st Century.</p>

<p>Although Vekllei has maintained courier systems for at least a thousand years, the Mail as a contiguous instituion was founded in 1422 by the Desimou VII, King of Vekllei, in the late Period of Rest. During this time, the lords of Vekllei had established significant mercantile holdings across the North Atlantic, and had developed reliable systems of trade throughout Ireland and Denmark. The Royal Mail of Vekllei was first established as a royal communications organ that sought to ensure stability of the Desimou rule across the incresingly autonomous Vekllei empire. In this period, the Mail consisted of a handful of messengers attached to the feudal military apparatus of the Vekllei monarchy, which transferred to the incoming Junta upon collapse of the monarchy.</p>

</p>
<p>The Mail would not come to resemble conventional civilian Mail until 1652, when the Junta expanded postal contracts to the privy councils of the Faroe and Greenland territories, and later broke apart the Mail monopoly to benefit then-Secretary of State Kism Sismiosnah, who established the New Parliament Postal Service. It was not until nearly a century later, in 1742, that company services were opened to all land-owning Vekllei people, and the Mail came to resemble its contemporary mandate.</p>
<p>The Mail was reestablished in 2015, during Vekllei independence. It was afforded a mandate protected by the postwar <a href="/factbook/vekllei/#floral-society">Petticoat Constitution</a>, and all existing private mail services established in occupation were folded directly into the new state monopoly. In 2016, a year after reestablishment, Mi Miou was elected as the world&rsquo;s first female Postmistress General. The Floral Period of the Royal Mail has been marked by a rapid expansion of both infrastructure and services in Vekllei and abroad. World Post, the international for-profit arm of the Mail, was established in 2034.</p>

<p>The Mail is organised horizontally as an independent branch of the Royal Vekllei Armed Forces, and so, unlike other State Requisites, reports directly to the Prime Ministers of the Vekllei Government, as representatives of the Landscape Sovereign. As is common with most large-scale industry in Vekllei, the Mail is vertically integrated, and the majority of its contract work is consolidated directly into the bureau structure.</p>
<p>The Mail has two offices of administration: the General Office and the Office of the Postmistress, which are responsible for daily operations and interdepartmental administration respectively. The following table outlines the Mail&rsquo;s structure.</p>

<p><strong>Universal service is</strong>, by the glossary of the Mail, truly universal. As mandated by Vekllei law, the Mail provides delivery for all postage material anywhere in the world, or indeed, beyond it. It maintains 6,424 post offices across Vekllei, including its antarctic and peripheral possessions. The Mail&rsquo;s first Lunar Post Office opened in 2059. In addition to its domestic monopoly, the Mail contributes nearly VK‚ù¶2.6 trillion each year towards the Vekllei Government Securities Bureau (the country&rsquo;s sovereign wealth fund) through its international postage and courier services abroad, under the name World Post.</p>

<p>The Mail aims to provide next-day delivery during weekdays in zero-code (that is to say, <em>Home Island</em>) regions. Overnight delivery is also generally available between <em>Home Islands</em>, <em>Aismious</em> Islands, <em>Kala</em> and the <em>Azores</em> during weekdays. Most Lunar territories are available on Mondays and Fridays, and other territories are available according to the Mail&rsquo;s region table.</p>
<p>Although Vekllei people do not pay to post items, stamps are affixed with coloured squares called <em>chromacodes</em> which are used in the automatic sorting machines common in the country. International Mail uses traditional stamps with price listed, and the Vekllei Crown displayed. Franking is used for tracking and identification.</p>

<p>Special, commercial and industrial postage is managed within the <strong>Postal Service Bureau</strong> through special sorting facilities and a dedicated postal network. Regular business postage is funnelled through regular daily service, but hazardous, oversized and dangerous goods are accepted by special Post Offices designed to accept them. The Mail does not provide special services for regular residential or courier delivery.</p>

<p>The Mail is best known overseas as the <strong>World Post</strong>, which offers services for foreign clients and has established itself as one of the Big Four international transnational courier services in the world today. Similar to domestic postal systems in other countries, the World Post offers flat rates for delivery anywhere in the world, priced according to size and weight. In addition, sister company <strong>Universal Express</strong> offers next-day weekday delivery in certain markets. Most employees of the World Post and Universal Express are foreign workers banking labour-hours for immigration to Vekllei. Unlike domestic service, the World Post and Universal Express use private courier contracts extensively to fulfil orders.</p>

<p>The <strong>Labour Bank of Vekllei</strong><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> is easily accessible via the Mail&rsquo;s <strong>Financial Services Bureau</strong>. Although inaccessible within the country, savings can be withdrawn conditionally upon emigration, and the Mail offers easy access and financial counselling for Vekllei people. Through the Financial Services Bureau, the Mail also offers financial management to immigrant populations with wealth transfer (the phrase for banking of savings and prior income) and Overseas Accounting, commonly used to send money to family abroad.</p>

<p><strong>Cosma</strong> (a portmanteau of <em>communicasia matismion</em>) is Vekllei&rsquo;s state communications company, responsible for all residential and public telephones in the country. This includes videophones, public phone booths, and residential networks. Cosma also maintains telecommunications infrastructure networks internationally through <strong>Cosma Overseas</strong>, primarily the Vekllei-Europe undersea cables and their sister sets between Vekllei and North America. Much of the network dates back over a hundred years, since a shortage of modern personal telephones in Vekllei requires Cosma to maintain a wide variety of voltage and cable standards. Commercial, industrial and government telecommunications is managed by a seperate internal department called the <strong>Industrial Telecommunications Office</strong>.</p>

In total, the Mail delivers nearly 50 million pieces of mail during weekdays.</div>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>It is evident</strong> that the services assigned to the Mail by the postwar constitution are of critical importance to the stability of Vekllei society. In addition to being one of the oldest active postal organisations in the world, the Royal Mail of Vekllei is tremendously busy, since physical post has scarcely been displaced by the telephone in the country. Even without the Mail&rsquo;s international postage, domestic mail each day can exceed 12 million pieces &ndash; enough for 1 in 2 people, though commercial mail and periodicals are included.</p>

<p>As is typical for critical bureaus in Vekllei, the Mail alleviates the stress of daily service through its dense, vertically-integrated infrastructure aided by automatic (automen vehicles) and permanent fixtures (pneumatic systems and automatic sorting/franking machines). It is precisely this commitment to infrastructure that makes the Mail so visible in daily life, and contributes to its ongoing legacy as Vekllei&rsquo;s oldest running government institution.</p>

<p>The Mail employs 48,960 people full-time across its various offices, and nearly 200,000 automen in various roles. Although the Mail does retain a staff of postmen and couriers, most urban daily service is now provided by automatic vehicles and sorting, which account for nearly half of the total automen owned by the organisation. Instead, the majority of Mail employees are involved in the running of the organisation &ndash; mostly as clerks, managers, and administrators. Around 10,000 postmen are employed by the Mail in daily delivery, called &ldquo;posties&rdquo;. There are around 8,000 postal routes in the country.</p>
<p>Although at first glance the number of automen dramatically exceeds demand, the total count is misleading &ndash; most automen with the Mail are integrated into the infrastructure of its sorting centres and post offices, and very few are traditionally autonomous robots commonly seen in public in Vekllei. Only about 8,000 automen are employed in physical mail delivery.</p>
<p>There are 16,220 post boxes in Vekllei, which are iconic for their red and gold paint and intricate detailing.</p>

<p>The Mail retains a large and diverse fleet of vehicles in regular operations, which, due to their diversity and and expense, have become iconic around the world. From bicycles to space planes, the Mail&rsquo;s fleet of vehicles rivals in diversity postal services three times its size, largely benefitted by Vekllei&rsquo;s obfuscated budgeting system and cultural importance afforded to the organisation.</p>

<h2 id="overview">
  Overview
  <a class="anchor" href="#overview">#</a>
</h2>
<p>In Vekllei, &ldquo;history&rdquo; as it is presently conceptualised is not continuous or inevitable, and the island country has been excluded from history as an invention of 19th century Europe. This article seeks to document the ways the so-called &lsquo;Vekllei perspective&rsquo; bucks historicist assumptions about history, progress, and many features of observable reality by depicting their differences.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that Vekllei was &rsquo;left alone&rsquo; for many centuries by the European and later American continental powers, except as an entrep√¥t with foreign contact restricted to trading ports. The isolationist 3rd Commonwealth, known under many names but referred to colloquially as a series of <em>junta parliaments</em> or <em>juntas</em>, did not really resemble a unified kingdom-state but instead a series of disparate clans with distinct cultural, ethnic and religious backgrounds with commonhoods developed in isolation. This tradition continues to exist today, to the surprise of foreigners. Vekllei uses phrases and names for its government and subordinate state ministries that, when assembled together, resemble a highly centralised and powerful city-state. In reality, the Vekllei state better resembles a thousand villages, across many islands, united in a series of timid councils and shallow departments. Many wonderful features of Vekllei are not architected but inherited from several thousand years of isolation and anger.</p>
<h3 id="the-post-war-state">
  The Post-War State
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-post-war-state">#</a>
</h3>
<p>It is worth considering that nearly 40% of Vekllei people today were born overseas, and the population of the country has increased from 11 millions in 2015 to 24 millions in 2063. These new Vekllei citizens, called <em>rosmehn</em> or &rsquo;new neighbours,&rsquo; are from all over the world, and mostly came to Vekllei for political or economic reasons to participate in the opportunities apparent in the building of the 4th Commonwealth. Of course, these cultures have not inherited Vekllei metaphysics or its millennia of assumptions about the world immediately. Their children, however, are taught in a Vekllei curriculum and are already becoming exposed to these ideas. It is too early to tell exactly how this dramatic shift in population will affect future metaphysics in Vekllei, but there is no evidence yet to assume total destruction or total assimilation. Likely, these cultures will be influenced by existing Vekllei ideas and will become distinct from their home cultures.</p>
<p>It is important to clarify then that references to the &lsquo;Vekllei person&rsquo; in this article assume a belief in traditional metaphysics, as well as <a href="/religion">Upen</a>. This article documents traditional beliefs rather than a total and contemporary reflection of the assumptions of all Vekllei people, who are more numerous and more diverse than ever.</p>
<h2 id="cultural-landscape">
  Cultural Landscape
  <a class="anchor" href="#cultural-landscape">#</a>
</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>At the root of realism there must be passion; without passion it is hard for there to be anything more than description for the sake of description.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ndash; Kitamura Tokoku,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> 1894</p>
<p>Vekllei people do not generally understand the natural world as seperate from themselves. Physical landscape is, intuitively, understood as a reflection of their interior selves, and extends outwardly and limitlessly. Unlike modern assumptions, which consider physical reality to be external and thus able to be depicted objectively and realistically, Vekllei people to not distinguish between external and internal realities, and consequently do not have default conceptualisations of exteriority and interiority. This epistemic feature means that many subsequent concepts do not really exist in Vekllei &ndash; categories of human beings like &lsquo;children&rsquo; and &lsquo;young adults,&rsquo; literature and sickness.</p>
<p>To clarify, it is not that those things do not exist in Vekllei &ndash; this article refers only to the perception of features of life and to what they are assigned. The mythologising of illness; the casting of others as characters; the categorisation of culture into movements and eras; the linearity and historicism of history and progress. It is these things, foundational and apparently timeless in Western imagination, that are absent in Vekllei.</p>
<p>When people talk about &lsquo;alienation from nature&rsquo; in a Vekllei context, they do not mean it in a physical sense (as in urbanised living) but in a transcendental sense, as the natural world being objectified and externalised. This is clear in the Vekllei tradition of poetry, or <em>ensaga</em>, in which no distinction is given between narration and speech.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once a landscape has been established, its origins are repressed from memory. It takes on the appearance of an &ldquo;object&rdquo; which has been there, outside us, from the start. [&hellip;] Rather than existing prior to landscape, subject and object emerge from within it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ndash; Kojin Karatani, <em>Origins of Japanese Literature</em></p>
<p>These assumptions contribute to the uniqueness of Vekllei as a contemporary culture and nation-state, and significantly to its land-metaphysics. Vekllei animism, both as religious feature of <a href="/religion/">Upen</a> and a secular cultural feature, is informed by the absence of conceptual segregation of the interior and exterior, and the person and the natural world. Similarly, <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language/#topet">Vekllei logographic writing</a> is not subordinated to Vekllei <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language/#spoken-vekllei">phonetic speech</a>, and so its transcendental visual representations of concepts informs how Vekllei people consider those concepts &ndash; that is, transcendental and thus personal. A mountain is depicted visually in <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language/#topet"><em>topet</em></a> as all mountains and any mountain, rather than an objective place with existing, externalised features.</p>
<p>Together, these facts account for many decisions made in the building of the post-war 4th Commonwealth, and also work unseen to produce the aspects of Vekllei society that are well known overseas (and are to some extent mythologised in the orientalist tradition).</p>

<p>The Vekllei <em>Ministry of Commerce</em> (COSMOSOL) regulates and initiates trade in the country. Despite the functional moneylessness of the Commonwealth, COSMOSOL remains among the busiest ministries of the Interior Government, since all economic policy, international trade and entitled renumeration (the Vekllei turn-of-phrase for withdrawing from the <a href="#bank-of-vekllei">Labour Bank</a>) occurs through its subordinate commissions. Common responsibilities of COSMOSOL include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regulation and taxation of international trade, particularly through Government &lsquo;<a href="/factbook/society/state/finance/?ref=footer#white-bonds">White Bonds</a>&rsquo; and Labour Bank &lsquo;<a href="/factbook/society/state/finance/?ref=footer#blue-bonds">Blue Bonds</a>&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Banking the Commonwealth state apparatus.</li>
<li>Advising the Parliament on economic policy and foreign trade.</li>
<li>Monitoring and reporting on the health of foreign markets.</li>
<li>Printing and transporting currency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vekllei has a reputation as a financial capital for its political neutrality and location between Europe and the Americas, and is among the largest facilitators of international commerce and exchange in the world.</p>

</h3>
<p>The <em>Labour Bank of Vekllei</em> (commonly &ldquo;<em>Bank of Vekllei</em>&rdquo;) is the central bank and currency store of Vekllei. It is operated by the Ministry of Commerce and maintains branches in most major borough capitals in the Home Islands, as well as across all member states of the Vekllei Commonwealth. It is not autonomous and is beholden to the policy decisions of COSMOSOL and, in certain cases, the Interior and Commonwealth Parliaments. Its sworn purpose, as instructed by the Floral Constitution, is to advocate for Floral Economics.</p>
<p>The Bank of Vekllei was founded 1642 as the Royal Bank in <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/lola/">Lola</a>, and is the fifth oldest bank in the world.</p>
<p>Most banks in Vekllei are institutional or industrial, since the average Vekllei person is unmoneyed and, in a conventional definition, unbanked. Nonetheless, Vekllei maintains several commercial banks under the Bank of Vekllei umbrella, tasked primarily with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cashing and underwriting White and Blue bonds.</li>
<li>Selling government and financial (bureau) bonds internationally.</li>
<li>International placement and borrowing services.</li>
<li>Trading, settling and selling foreign currencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vekllei citizens are entitled to an equal share of the money stored in the Labour Bank, and in certain circumstances may withdraw their balance to emigrate or travel abroad.</p>
<p>Despite foreign perception of Vekllei economics, the liquid and asset holdings of the Bank of Vekllei make it the second-largest bank in the world.</p>

<p>The <em>Ministry of Defence</em> (COSMOKOS) represents the Sovereign Armed Forces of the Vekllei Commonwealth in the Interior Government, which are consolidated under the <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/commonwealth/security/#commonwealth-military-command">Commonwealth Military Command</a>. COSMOKOS does not exercise command authority over the armed forces of Vekllei, and serves instead as the ministerial liaison between the Commonwealth Military Command and the Interior Government. Common responsibilities of COSMOKOS include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recruitment of citizens and foreigners into the Commonwealth armed forces.</li>
<li>Procuring equipment to meet the Vekllei obligation towards the Commonwealth armed forces.</li>
<li>Training citizens and foreigners for the branches of the Commonwealth armed forces.</li>
<li>Conducting scientific military research.</li>
<li>Policing and security of Vekllei territories and waters.</li>
</ul>
<p>COSMOKOS also provides security services domestically, and is responsible for most internal police and security organisations in Vekllei.</p>
<div class="outline ">
  <h3 id="armed-forces-of-vekllei">
  Armed Forces of Vekllei
  <a class="anchor" href="#armed-forces-of-vekllei">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The <em>Armed Forces of Vekllei</em>, arranged under the COSMOKOS ministry, are unusual in that they do not have control directly over troops or equipment. The actual armed forces of Vekllei, known as the <a href="/factbook/society/state/palace/military/">Crown Armed Forces</a>, are a sovereign feature of the country and as such are placed under direct supervision of the <a href="/factbook/society/state/palace/">Palace of Vekllei</a> &ndash; seperate from the Vekllei and Commonwealth governments.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Armed Forces of Vekllei, an agency-level body under control of COSMOKOS, is to integrate the Crown Armed Forces with the interior government, and facilitate the employ of Vekllei people in the Armed Forces.</p>
<h4 id="department-of-communications">
  Department of Communications
  <a class="anchor" href="#department-of-communications">#</a>
</h4>
<p>The <em>Department of Communications</em> is a bureau-level organisation of the Armed Forces responsible for coordinating public information about military activities. It also produces several newspapers and periodicals for servicemen through subservient publishing houses.</p>
<h4 id="department-of-compulsory-service">
  Department of Compulsory Service
  <a class="anchor" href="#department-of-compulsory-service">#</a>
</h4>
<p>The <em>Department of Compulsory Service</em> (DoCS, also CS) oversees the Vekllei Compulsory Service Scheme, a hybrid civilian/military conscription law that requires four years from each Commonwealth citizen between the ages of 18 and 32. Despite reporting to the Armed Forces of COSMOKOS, the DoCS does not facilitate widespread conscription and mobilisation of the civilian population, a role served by the <a href="#department-of-mobilisation">DoM</a>. Instead, it is responsible primarily for supervising the fulfilment of the Compulsory Service Scheme, and administrating the conscription and training of Vekllei citizens, including in civilian and industrial roles.</p>

  Department of Mobilisation
  <a class="anchor" href="#department-of-mobilisation">#</a>
</h4>
<p>The <em>Department of Mobilisation</em> (DoM) is responsible for recruitment in peacetime, and conscription in the outbreak of war. In the Floral Period, Vekllei defensive doctrine aims to make the country &ldquo;ungovernable,&rdquo; requiring widespread mobilisation and training of the civilian population. Unlike the <a href="#department-of-compulsory-service">DoCS</a>, the DoM is concerned primarily with the combat effectiveness of the mobilised population, and is generally distinguished in its strategic military thinking.</p>
<h4 id="department-of-peacekeeping">
  Department of Peacekeeping

<p>The <em>Department of Peacekeeping</em> (DoP) coordinates Vekllei&rsquo;s overseas peacekeeping operations. Vekllei is among the largest contributors of men and equipment towards United Nations Peacekeeping Forces, which are responsible to and administrated by the DoP while deployed. The Department of Peacekeeping also engages with international mechanisms for peace, and contributes personnel as part of foreign aid or disaster relief.</p>
<h4 id="intelligence-liaison-office">
  Intelligence Liaison Office
  <a class="anchor" href="#intelligence-liaison-office">#</a>

<p>The <em>Intelligence Liaison Office</em> is a specialised office that coordinates military intelligence between Vekllei&rsquo;s security apparatuses, particularly those of the <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/commonwealth/security/#national-intelligence-directorate">National Intelligence Directorate</a>. Intelligence gathering in Vekllei is performed by a variety of mostly autonomous espionage organs, and the purpose of the Liaison is to authenticate and prepare intelligence for military use. It includes the following branches.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>National Intelligence Branch</strong>: Coordination of intelligence gathered by security apparatuses with Armed Forces.</li>
<li><strong>Civilian Intelligence Branch</strong>: Coordination of intelligence gathered by industrial and civilian sectors (in occupied territories, for example) with Armed Forces and security apparatuses.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Intelligence Branch</strong>: Coordination of intelligence gathered by the Armed Forces with security apparatuses.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sovereign-liaison-office">
  Sovereign Liaison Office
  <a class="anchor" href="#sovereign-liaison-office">#</a>
</h4>
<p>The <em>Sovereign Liaison Office</em> is a specialised office intended to link the command of the <a href="/factbook/society/state/palace/military/">Crown Armed Forces of Vekllei</a> with COSMOKOS, an interior ministry with no direct control over troops of the Crown. Although it is the <em>de facto</em> office of communication with the Crown forces, in practice communication generally occurs directly with the relevant COSMOKOS department. The purpose of the Sovereign Liaison is mostly as a democracy-advocate, supervising the COSMOKOS departments as an anti-corruption watchdog similar to other democracy-advocates. It also ensures COSMOKOS operations do not affect sovereign operations</p>

<p>The <em>Vekllei Electric Commission</em> (VEC, also Thunderburo) is responsible for the state monopoly on electricity generation in Vekllei. Although the VEC is structured as a bureau company, its subsidiaries are state-owned and consequently operates similarly to other agency-level departments of the <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/interior">Interior Parliament</a>. The VEC consists of multiple subcommissions dedicated to unique types of electricity generation in Vekllei, primarily through hydro-electric, geothermal and nuclear methods.</p>

</h4>
<p>The Vekllei <em>Magma-Electric Commission</em> (colloquially <em>The Magma</em> or MEC) oversees geothermal electricity production in Vekllei. Because of Vekllei&rsquo;s location over the rift of the European and American continental plates, widespread geothermal electricity production is widespread and makes up the majority of commercial and domestic electricity consumption in Vekllei. Forty-six MEC plants of varying sizes supply clean renewable energy to Vekllei households, and waste heat is used to heat greenhouses Vekllei depends on for food production.</p>
<h4 id="hydro-electric-commission">

<p>The Vekllei <em>Hydro-Electric Commission</em> (colloquially <em>The Hydro</em>, not to be confused with the <a href="#vekllei-water-commission"><em>Hydroburo</em></a>) oversees hydro-electric electricity generation in Vekllei, particularly in the glacial regions of the Vekllei Islands and Kala. Dramatic mountain terrain in the interior of the Vekllei Islands proved suitable candidates for hydro-electric dams, which were mostly constructed in the pre-war and immediate post-war era. Vekllei&rsquo;s oldest dam in <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/ou/">Ou</a> has been operating continuously for 156 years.</p>
<h4 id="nuclear-electric-commission">

  <a class="anchor" href="#nuclear-electric-commission">#</a>
</h4>
<p>The Vekllei <em>Nuclear-Electric Commission</em> (also <em>Atomic Vekllei</em> or NEC) oversees nuclear electricity generation in Vekllei. Nuclear energy has proliferated in postwar Vekllei, and satisfies the Commonwealth&rsquo;s growing industrial power demands. Most commercial nuclear plants in Vekllei use uranium-233 reactor fuels, processed mostly at the National Centrifuge &amp; Enrichment Plant in Speidisn. Vekllei reactors mostly of a molten salt type. The NEC maintains 56 plants in total across the Commonwealth, most of which are located in the Vekllei Islands or Kala.</p>

<p>The <em>Vekllei Water Commission</em> (Hydroburo) is responsible for providing potable drinking water, wastewater and stormwater services to the Vekllei Islands and most Commonwealth members. Water in Vekllei is universal and of good quality. The Hydroburo also maintains offices for sewerage, conservation, and construction.</p>
<p>In the Vekllei Islands and Kala, most drinking water comes from fresh glacial runoff that requires minimal treating. Industrial water consumption is provided by nuclear desalination plants operated by the Hydroburo.</p>

<p>The <em>Emergency Light and Water Authority</em> (EVA) is a specialised department of the Ministry of Light and Water designed to mitigate interruption to electricity and water supply. Its mandate includes the security of utility infrastructure and disaster preparation. In the event of major interruption to the utilities supervised by the Ministry, the EVA would assume direct control of the Hydro and Thunderburos and coordinate their recovery. Threats include both natural disasters like volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, as well as damage from conventional or nuclear war.

  COSMOCOM
</b>
<p>The <em>Ministry of the Commonwealth</em> (COSMOCOM) is the organ through which the Interior Parliament communicates and cooperates with the Commonwealth Parliament and its secretariats. Its primary responsibility is cooperation between member states and standardisation, and publishes reports and manuals towards this goal. It is also the primary ministry through which the subordinates of the Commonwealth influence the Interior Parliament. COSMOCOM is also responsible for ensuring changes made to the Floral Constitution are implemented domestically. Common responsibilities of COSMOCOM include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advising, training and auditing local accreditation and qualifications in line with Commonwealth standards and directives.</li>
<li>Ensuring that the Vekllei interior state meets standards determined by the Commonwealth parliaments and international commitments.</li>
<li>Developing and enforcing standards in technical, industrial and brand features of the Interior Government and its responsible state assets and bureau partners.</li>
<li>Training and maintaining the workforce for the Interior civil service and Interior state assets in line with Commonwealth standards and directives.</li>
</ul>
<p>COSMOCOM&rsquo;s commitments to the transnational Commonwealth Parliaments go both ways &ndash; the ministry ensures domestic compliance and also advises Commonwealth policy and standards, since the Vekllei Interior Government is the largest and most industrious member-state of the Commonwealth.</p>
<div class="outline ">
  <h3 id="accreditation-directorate">
  Accreditation Directorate
  <a class="anchor" href="#accreditation-directorate">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The <em>Accreditation Directorate</em> (also <em>Qualifications Vekllei</em> or VAD) is a transnational auditor of industrial, commercial and academic qualifications in Vekllei. VAD also develops technical and procedural standards for its responsible commercial and industrial partners. VAD also interfaces directly with international standards organisations on behalf of its subordinate auditors.</p>
<p>Standards in education for teachers and staff are generally developed and audited by the <a href="/factbook/society/government/#commonwealth-education-secretariat">Commonwealth Education Secretariat</a>.</p>
<p>VDA also maintains a catalogue of products and technical manuals available to industry partners, and enforces compliance for industrial and commercial standards through its subordinate inspectorate.</p>
<p>The Accreditation Directorate also represents Vekllei in the International Organisation for Standardisation and other industrial standards bodies.</p>
<h4 id="vekllei-qualifications-commission">
  Vekllei Qualifications Commission

<p>The <em>Standardisations Directorate</em> (SSD, also Standards Vekllei) works to unify management and supervision of state bodies and assets in Vekllei. It also mandates the responsibilities and visual identity of all departments of the Government and boroughs of the Commonwealth, including the appearance and manuals of style of Commonwealth infrastructure and publications. Its work includes both operating procedures and major brand elements like flags and logos, and specific linguistic and typographic features including typefaces, preferred punctuation and symbols. It has considerable authority over other departments, which usually lack autonomy to enforce their own visual identity independently. Most visual work for the Standardisations Directorate is performed by in-house designers and artists.</p>

<p>Municipalities in Vekllei are the predominant form of local government, and vary dramatically in scale, power and resources. They usually refer to council municipalities, which are bodies of elected industrial and political leaders of a community. This open-ended definition means that municipalities scale in Vekllei from tiny villages to major metropolitan areas.</p>
<p>Municipalities are the basis of Vekllei localism, a belief in local concern and decentralised decision-making. In general, Vekllei municipalism describes the places where society in abstract meets the individual, and so also has cultural and aesthetic qualities. The sum of a municipality is expressed in the <em>Atlantic Municipalist</em> tradition, which consists of the following principles:</p>
<blockquote class="hint panel">
  <div class="icon">
</div> 
  <div class="text"><p><strong>Principles of Atlantic Municipalism</strong></p>

<li>Property stewardship.</li>
<li>Open air and clean water.</li>
<li>Land usefulness (&ldquo;friendliness&rdquo;).</li>
<li>Private ownership of private needs.</li>
<li>Public ownership of public needs.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>There are 14,000 municipalities across the Commonwealth. The usage of &lsquo;municipal&rsquo; can refer to a political council or the spirit of Atlantic Municipalism.</p>

<h2 id="overview">
  Overview
  <a class="anchor" href="#overview">#</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Vekllei National Rail (VNR)</strong> is a catch-all term for bureau-backed, state-owned rail operators of Vekllei. In casual use, it refers to the Vekllei National Railway A.r.R. and its sister companies, like Vekllei Metro, which are structured within the service-oriented Railways Bureau. More precisely, Vekllei National Rail encompasses several different bureaus that operate, design, maintain and communicate rail service in the country, which itself is further included under the Transport Requisite of the Vekllei Government.</p>
<p>Like most critical organisations of Vekllei, the structure and directorship of Vekllei National Rail is complex, but can be simplified by understanding that all rail transport in the country is ultimately the responsibility of an organisation called Vekllei National Rail, and it is towards this organ that this article is addressed. Today, the National Rail operates nearly 20,000km of track, indicating the density of the rail service it provides, and services nearly 20 million people each day through its network.</p>
<h3 id="introduction">
  Introduction
  <a class="anchor" href="#introduction">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Since nationalisation of the private Vekllei rail companies in 1925, the structure and reach of Vekllei National Rail has changed several times. Operated as a for-profit enterprise at a historical loss, the National Rail&rsquo;s history of service is reflected in the variety of trains and track gauges it maintains.</p>
<p>Vekllei is unique in the density of its rail, a feature of deliberate postwar city planning and the Home Island&rsquo;s history as an industrial port city-state. Very few Vekllei people own automobiles, and trains remain by far the most common method of travel in the country. Because of this, the rail network in metropolitan areas is extraordinarily dense, and is designed to offer access to nearly every residence in urban areas. This fact also explains the presence of dedicated rail lines to small towns and villages that would otherwise not justify their maintenance. As visible on the map above, the passenger rail network in Vekllei is unsurpassed in its density, which contributes to the dependence Vekllei people have on their trains.</p>

<p>Similarly, almost all freight is run along rails of varying gauges. These range from conventional freight trains at standard gauge, to municipal delivery trains at metre guage, and even narrow gauges for moving freight and equipment within large factory complexes. Most major stores and grocers are arranged along freight lines with dedicated sidings, or have their own narrow-gauge tracks dedicated to their use.</p>
<p>Unusually, Vekllei National Rail is legally absolved of all non-rail transport, and possesses no busses or ferries for public use, which are operated and maintained by dedicated adjacent bureaus.</p>
<h3 id="history">
  History
  <a class="anchor" href="#history">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Although Vekllei has used wagonways since the 18th Century and developed horse-drawn railways for industrial transport in its ports, the first passenger rail line in Vekllei was founded in 1855 by the <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/pharos/#pharos-railway-company-museum">Pharos Rail Company</a>.</p>
<p>The history of rail in Vekllei can be summarised in three key eras of development.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early Development and expansion</strong>, from early service in 1855.</li>
<li><strong>Late Junta/Prewar nationalisation</strong>, from nationalisation in 1925.</li>
<li><strong>Postwar refounding and development</strong>, since independence in 2015.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the foundation of VNR after nationalisation, rail in Vekllei has seen the scale of its passenger rail networks quadruple in size. It is internationally regarded for its safety and reliability.</p>
<h4 id="early-development">
  Early Development
  <a class="anchor" href="#early-development">#</a>
</h4>
<p>The first railways in Vekllei developed alongside its ports, as Vekllei&rsquo;s position as an intermediary free port between Europe and the Americas rapidly developed Vekllei&rsquo;s industrial base. Although the earliest internal rail wagons were pulled by horses, primitive steam locomotives had modernised most ports by the early 19th Century.</p>
<p>The first passenger rail line opened in 1855 between <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/pharos/">Pharos</a> and the present-day borough of Little Vekllei to alleviate the expense of moving goods from the <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/pharos/#port-of-pharos">Port of Pharos</a> to established settlement further inland. The original line was only a few kilometres long, but was extended in 1858 and again in 1872. By this time, several other lines had been established under private rail companies, including passenger services between Vekllei Proper and Little Vekllei, as well as the beginnings of the Montre-Vekllei Railroad.</p>
<p>By the beginning of the 20th Century, Vekllei had a half-dozen major railroad companies, and dozens other limited/local services provided by private operators or their municipality. This saw a massive increase in both the movement of freight and ridership, and helped entrench Vekllei&rsquo;s position as a stopover port city for transatlantic freight and passage.</p>
<h4 id="nationalisation">

  <a class="anchor" href="#nationalisation">#</a>
</h4>
<p>The early 20th Century was marked by an exponential increase in ridership, which saw a proliferation of new railroads across the Home Islands. Metropolitan and suburban lines during this period were characterised by overcrowding, poor reliability and irregular service. These factors, in addition to the growing economic power of rail barons in the country, saw the Atlantic Junta (known as the Crown) move to nationalise all metropolitan and intercity passenger rail service in 1925 as the Vekllei National Rail Company (VNC).</p>
<p>The centralisation of Vekllei rail accompanied standardisation of its commuter track gauge, which improved travel times across the country. The VNC period was characterised by reliable investment and a commitment to modernisation of rail in the country. By the late 20th Century, the Vekllei Metropolitan Underground was widely regarded as one of the most beautiful subway systems in the world.</p>
<p>In the late 1980s, VNC started work on what would eventually become the Vekllei-Montre bullet train. The programme overran its cost estimates and was delayed several times, and was not completed until 2004, shortly before the Atomic War.</p>

<p>National Rail Company assets that had been operated by the occupation Vekllei Provisional Government were transferred to the Vekllei Interim Government in 2015 and reestablished as Vekllei National Rail (VNR) in 2018. The Floral Period has been marked by steady growth in ridership and the scale of its network. The organisation also invests heavily into the development of new locomotives and EMUs, culminating in 2047 with the announcement of the Vekllei East Coast Maglev Scheme, which are the fastest commuter trains in the world.</p>

<p>In 2055, VNR celebrated &ldquo;250 years of rail,&rdquo; and its livery and staff uniforms were overhauled to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>Today, VNR represents the sole means of medium/long-distance transport for over 80% of Vekllei commuters, indicating its continuous status as a monopoly of travel, not just rail, in the country.</p>
<h3 id="structure">
  Structure
  <a class="anchor" href="#structure">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Vekllei National Rail is an organ of the Transport Requisite of the Vekllei Government (A.r.R., or <em>requoisesiasn amourisocietie resmesnghet</em>) as several individual state requisite bureaus, which in turn are charged with different transport companies. Although its structure in Vekllei might be analogous to a government ministry abroad, it functions in practice more like a state-owned enterprise with private subsidiaries. It is not a state-run corporation, and maintains seperate accounting.</p>
<p>Vekllei National Rail is administered through three State Requisites: the Vekllei National Rail itself including all regular operations and rail service, the National Rail Insurance Scheme which finances construction through Government White Bonds, and the Rail Safety Commission.</p>

<p>Access to public transport is considered a &ldquo;critical luxury&rdquo; of the Vekllei state (the Vekllei turn-of-phrase for essential state services) and, by extension, the functioning of its society. By design, it makes no profit, and is subsidised entirely by the Transport Requisite of the Vekllei Government and various independent transport bureaus for the benefit of any Vekllei person. Even prior to the war and investment of the Floral Period, Vekllei&rsquo;s public transport was widely regarded as among the finest of any network in the world thanks to its impeccable safety record, timeliness, and comprehensive coverage.</p>

<p>Rail transport contributes tremendously to the national culture and common affection for Vekllei&rsquo;s public institutions. It is also commonly percieved as a triumph of the postwar floral Period, despite rail history in Vekllei dating back hundreds of years prior. The ongoing expansion of the VNR network and renovation of stations and railhubs commands attention internationally, which is watching Vekllei celebrate its golden age of rail.</p>
<h3 id="national-rail">
  National Rail
  <a class="anchor" href="#national-rail">#</a>
</h3>
<p>National rail access is generally provided directly by Vekllei National Railway A.r.R. through a branch office dependent on the location. The Home Islands are served by VNR Atlantic, whereas Kala is served by VNR Overseas. The Home Islands house thousands of rural villages outside of urban metropolitan service, and Vekllei&rsquo;s dependence on rail transportatiion demands their inclusion in the VNR network. As such, almost every village in Vekllei has a rail line or interurban tramway, and villages as small as 20 persons see daily service to the capital.</p>
<h3 id="metropolitan-service--subways">
  Metropolitan Service &amp; Subways
  <a class="anchor" href="#metropolitan-service--subways">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The majority of VNR&rsquo;s ~10,000 trains per day run in metro or subway services throughout Vekllei urban and interurban routes. These lines are primarily serviced by the EMU workhorses of the VNR fleet, particularly 56 and 59-Series trainsets. In urban centers, VNR service is frequent enough to be unscheduled, with trains arriving every other minute or so.</p>
<p>The majority of Vekllei&rsquo;s underground metro network has been automated by Automatic Train Control, an industrial automan system that allows for driverless trains. Although still serviced by VNR platform staff with training to stop the train in emergencies, Vekllei&rsquo;s automatic metros are otherwise entirely driverless. VNR Overseas metros in Kala and the Kalina Isles retain drivers.</p>
<h3 id="tramways">
  Tramways
  <a class="anchor" href="#tramways">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Vekllei operates a variety of trams and streetcars, including double-decker street-level units in the capital region and so-called &ldquo;fast trams&rdquo; (inter-urban cars) outside of the cities. Depending on the make and route of the tramway, they may be grade-seperated or integrated into streets. Their ubuquity in urban areas has caused observers to regard them as the principle method of transport in the country, second only to the bicycle.</p>
<h3 id="freight">
  Freight
  <a class="anchor" href="#freight">#</a>
</h3>
<p>VNR&rsquo;s main freight lines run mostly on a seperate gauge and network, and are composed of several companies that operate regionally across a variety of locomotive types and industries. These include traditional freight locomotives and long/short cars, as well as freight trams and wagons used to transport goods around and between factories.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Nearly 17 million people per day commute via VNR&rsquo;s networks each day, making up a majority of the Vekllei population. In this sense, VNR&rsquo;s quality of operations affects the Vekllei person more than the quality of their government. In addition to commuter service, VNR automatic freight transit systems are the lifeblood of all industry and commerce in the country, and are regulated directly as a state requisite for their critical importance to the functioning of Vekllei society.</p>

</p>
<p>VNR operates 2,114 stations across the Home Islands, which vary from uncovered concrete platforms to tremendous terminus complexes that cover multiple city blocks. The largest station in the country, Vekllei Central, sees over 1 million people per day pass through its gates.</p>
<p>Vekllei&rsquo;s stations are well-regarded for the beauty and decoration overseas. As part of the Millenia Rail campaign in the mid-21st Century, VNR initiated a dramatic overhaul of its passenger infrastructure, restoring heritage-listed station interiors and renovating much of the early postwar metro construction with murals, new lighting, enlarged caverns and shafts, and improved safety features. The cleanliness and safety of Vekllei National Railway is a great point of pride in the country, and in part justifies VNR&rsquo;s tremendous fiscal losses in daily operation.</p>
<p>VNR services are mostly unticketed, and as a Vekllei industry, are free to ride.</p>

<p>The organisation is administered by the President of the Rail Central Office, which is responsible to the Transport Requisite and the Palace of Rail.

<p>Vekllei National Rail is perhaps unsurpassed in its variety of trainsets and their length of service. An unofficial policy of preservation has ensured that every unit type since the 1980s has seen an ongoing minor presence in current service. VNR rarely retires a trainset completely &ndash; in keeping with the contemporary cultural-political valuation of machines, a few units of each model are retained on various lines for their historical and technical significance. This includes steam locomotives, which continue to operate regular passengers service on some routes.</p>
<p>The backbone of the contemporary Vekllei rail fleet is the Electric Multiple Units (EMUs), which are designated by their year of manufacture.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> In particular, the 56 and 59-Series trainsets make up the majority of EMUs in service today, as they exclusively populate primary commuter lines in Vekllei&rsquo;s southwest. VNR also retains Diesel Multiple Units (DMUs) in its long-haul cold-weather routes, particularly in the Afouisneh region and Kala.</p>
<p>VNR pioneered super-conductive maglev transport for mass consumption, and its SC3 trainsets are the fastest in regular service in the world today, reaching nearly 750km/h in places. Its slowest locomotive, the T400 2-6-2 steam locomotive <em>Small Movements</em> built in 1928, averages just 30km/h on its tourist route in rural Krafla. VNR is also experimenting with nuclear-powered trainsets, but none have so far entered public testing.</p>

It is both an organised religious belief system and a decentralised local animism, localised regionally across the Home Islands and beyond.

<h2 id="overview">
  Overview
  <a class="anchor" href="#overview">#</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Upen</strong> is the animistic, nondenominational dominant and historical religion of Vekllei. Practiced commonly throughout the Home Islands and Vekllei&rsquo;s possessions, it is a core component of Vekllei culture and heritage, and has existed in various forms for thousands of years. Because <em>Upen</em> is fundamentally provincial and decentralised, its scripture and practice vary significantly between boroughs. Most forms emphasise object animism, impermanence, petite materialism, land dependence, existentialism and fear of nature.</p>
<p>Upen can be practiced at natural shrines, usually designated by a cairn, at running or still water, or the seaside. Maritime living and seafood are important aspects of Vekllei life, and fishing and ocean myths are key elements in <em>Upen</em>. Within its spiritualism, traditional folk-tales and scripture are called <em>sagas</em>, which have also archived much of Vekllei&rsquo;s early history.</p>
<p>Although traditionally atheist, <em>Upen</em> is commonly adopted by immigrant populations that include Catholic, Jewish and Buddhist faiths. In these contexts, <em>Upen</em>&rsquo;s animism and dependence on landscape is held alongside traditional beliefs, which are so common postwar that both Jewish and Catholic metaphysics have appeared in mainstream <em>Upen</em> doctrine in some cities, where large immigrant populations reside.</p>
<h3 id="introduction">
  Introduction
  <a class="anchor" href="#introduction">#</a>
</h3>
<p>You can find <em>Upen</em> all around you in Vekllei since, by its own spiritual metaphysics, animism is not human. It exists independently of human understanding or spirit, and <em>Upen</em> is merely the practice by which humans are cognisant and interact with the spirit of things. Wherever people and material existence collide, including man-made objects, you find <em>Upen</em>.</p>
<p>In this sense, <em>Upen</em> can be understood as having two distinct forms, practiced differently depending on the occasion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public <em>Upen</em>, which involves priests, communities, ceremony and cultural artefacts (like <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language/#25--upotenne"><em>Upotenne</em></a> and <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language/#23--rapotenne"><em>Rapotenne</em></a>). Public <em>Upen</em> manifests similarly to other faiths, in which sites of worship, historical texts and sacred spaces inform practice and understanding.</li>
<li>Private <em>Upen</em>, which involves personal understanding and direct physicality with the aspects of material being <em>Upen</em> holds sacred, namely the spirit of all things and the human form.</li>
</ul>
<p>

</figure>
</p>
<p>Although <em>Upen</em> does retain priests informally, it lacks a hierarchical structure and is largely agnostic towards organised religion, lived and practiced instead through traditions, folklore, lifestyle and metaphysics.</p>
<p>As atheistic and animistic, <em>Upen</em> shelters landscape from becoming ‚Äòsimply nature‚Äô, as it does when viewed as a product of a monotheistic creator god. Within Vekllei&rsquo;s &rsquo;landscape&rsquo; agnosticism, nature is not ‚Äòsimply nature‚Äô; it is a spiritual vessel in itself, inalienable and inextricably linked to human purpose and satisfaction. Industry is divorced from the whole concept; it is a country of forest commons, collective stewardship, and volcanic unrest.</p>
<h2 id="etymology">
  Etymology
  <a class="anchor" href="#etymology">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Upen as a word has its origins lost to time, but its linguistic characteristics can be found throughout modern Vekllei language. <em>U</em> (pronounced &lsquo;oo&rsquo;) is a prefix applied to matters of consciousness considered sacred or special, as replicated in the spirit-language of <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language/#6-upotenne"><em>Upotenne</em></a>. <em>Upen</em> likely has origins in a proto-<em>Islandi</em> language called <em>Kala</em>, which later was absorbed into <em>Topyas</em>, the predecessor to <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language">Vekllei</a>.</p>
<p>In modern usage, <em>Upen</em> refers to both the faith and metaphysic of Vekllei&rsquo;s local animism, as well as a general indicator for Vekllei faith, myth and traditional folklore.</p>

<p>The <em>Commonwealth Military Command</em> (CMC) is the unifying command organisation for the Crown Armed Forces, responsible ultimately for facilitating Commonwealth control of the armed forces. While the <a href="/factbook/society/state/palace/">Palace</a> retains direct command over the armed forces, defence activities are in practice a privilege of the Commonwealth parliaments and so the CMC exists primarily to carry out this arrangement. In principle, the CMC accommodates open communication between the Armed Forces and the Commonwealth, but more commonly acts as a <em>de facto</em> command organisation for broad military arrangements outside of direct military administration like defence policy, strategic planning, military infrastructure and logistics, and communications.</p>
<p>Commonwealth member-states usually maintain their own <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/interior/defence/">defence ministries</a>, and the CMC aims to standardise and consolidate defensive strength across the Commonwealth. It is made up of the following departments.</p>

<p>The <em>National Intelligence Directorate</em> (Noshem, or N.I.) is the secret service of the Commonwealth and Vekllei&rsquo;s primary covert intelligence apparatus abroad. It is concerned with intelligence-gathering, surveillance and operations external to the Commonwealth. It comprises of 40 semiautonomous outlines, which each may operate several offices. This complex and comprehensive intelligence organisation contributes to its legendary reputation abroad, and conspiracies of its presence in almost every country.</p>
<p>Noshem is unique in its broad recruitment of foreigners, many of whom are promised citizenship and residency in Vekllei. Many Noshem outlines recruit locally, and manage foreign assets through Vekllei-born supervisors.</p>

<h2 id="overview">
  Overview
  <a class="anchor" href="#overview">#</a>
</h2>
<p>There is no real distinction in Vekllei between <em>state assets</em>, <em>state-owned enterprises</em> (SOE) and <em>government-owned corporations</em> (GOC), and the terms are used interchangeably. A state asset is distinct from bureau companies<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> or private enterprise, and is often directed by government policy via an <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/interior/">Interior Ministry</a> or Parliament.</p>
<p>State assets make up about 40% of the <a href="/factbook/vekllei/">Vekllei Islands</a> GDP, and about 25% of total Commonwealth GDP. They occupy central roles in the Vekllei economy, often as functional or constitutional monopolies, and are responsible for 65% of the <a href="/factbook/society/state/finance/#international-markets">VKIM</a> market capitalisation.</p>
<h2 id="structure">
  Structure
  <a class="anchor" href="#structure">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Most large state assets are structured as &lsquo;petals&rsquo; around a &lsquo;stem,&rsquo; an official analogy that describes a centralised administrative core with decentralised, semiautonomous subsidiaries. SOE units that would be departmentalised in other countries are spun off as seperate companies in Vekllei and ruthlessly pruned, operating under a directive from the <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/interior/commonwealth/#state-assets-directorate">State Assets Directorate</a> to reduce operating overhead and practice &lsquo;professional maintenance,&rsquo; a local colloquialism meaning to prevent stagnation or waste. Despite this, the vast majority of state assets in Vekllei are largely inefficient and bureaucratic, and their titanic presence in the Vekllei economy essentially produces two distinct markets in its place &ndash; the inflexible, reliable and political economy of state assets and bureaus, and the innovative, agile and volatile private market. Both markets are considered critical assets in Vekllei.</p>
<p>The degree to which a state asset is responsible to a Vekllei parliament is obfuscated by the unique role they serve in the country. In many cases, state assets are functionally independent of their controlling <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/interior/">ministries</a> or <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/commonwealth/">secretariats</a>, and their relationship to the state is simply financial, with the state serving as a controlling shareholder-equivalent. In other cases, the mission and function of the asset is directly responsible to policy goals of its operator, and its business is closely linked to political concern of the Vekllei state. These statuses fluctuate with the strategic policy goals of the government in question.</p>
<p>Vekllei government is highly decentralised and includes several competing parliaments at the local, national and international level. Similarly, state assets and their responsibilities are highly diverse, and municipal ownership does not equate to national control. Municipalities are not (in most cases) subordinated to national government, and so municipal enterprises do not function in the same way national enterprises do.</p>

<p>The Vekllei economy is largely inefficient for a <a href="/posts/2020-07-13-economy/">variety of poltical and cultural reasons</a>, and this has resulted in an array of unique economic conditions that require different macroeconomic thinking to nations overseas. Although the Vekllei economy is functionally unmoneyed for Vekllei people, the Vekllei primary market is highly complex and involves intricate constellations of commodity markets, social factors of production, and tremendous public finance.</p>
<p>Rather than a direct redistribution of income and wealth, the Vekllei state uses assets to secure a basic standard of living for Vekllei people, advance industrial and commercial goals, and retain tight control over secondary and speculative markets that facilitate its liquid capital, which in turn provide mechanisms for foreign investment and trade in the country.</p>
<p>Vekllei does not resemble a modern consumer society, and so state assets are not geared towards consumer products. Similarly, the moneylessness of the Vekllei primary economy eliminates tremendous financial overhead that would otherwise be spent on maintaining the financial system, since these abstract relationships are usurped by direct industrial relations, company ballots, and directives given by ministerial production committees. These planned production mechanisms facilitate the reliable overproduction of essential goods that meet the needs of Vekllei population. The inflexibility of this system is supplanted by the private market of participatory labour, which produces the majority of consumer goods and products in Vekllei, if unreliably. Luxury goods are generally hyperlocalised or imported, and are scarce for most Veklei people.</p>

<p>There are three broad categories of state asset in Vekllei, arranged at their level of ownership. Crown companies belong to the <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/crown/">Crown</a> or <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/commonwealth/">Commonwealth</a> governments, and generally include unique or essential enterprises of the Vekllei state. State companies belong to national governments, including the Vekllei Islands as depicted here.
