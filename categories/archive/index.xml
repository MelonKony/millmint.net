I&amp;rsquo;m not a big fan-art guy, but I still find myself thinking about them years later and I wanted to paint them happy after the end of the film.</description>

Some industry associations attempt to limit availability to minors but generally it&amp;rsquo;s at the discretion of the shopkeeper. Often, shame and embarassment are more powerful tools than legislation in Vekllei.
Generally it&amp;rsquo;s pretty traditional stuff supported by columns and fiction, although it varies between pornographers.</description>

Talking about utopia in character is much harder. How can you find utopia in flawed and sometimes unattractive human beings? By what metric is the vague, intuitive values of a utopia measured against a living person?</description>

The Caf√© Resmoiones approaches its hundredth birthday as the girls outside await their fifteenth. The building was once a kindergarten, so they‚Äôd been told, but through decades of Vekllei‚Äôs irreverent planning it had become a caf√©. It was not a very good caf√©, the food was shit, but the building was nice and it was at the bottom of Lola‚Äôs steep residential hill.</description>

 Six bodies hung from the Rodney Creek Railroad Bridge, without names. The leftmost corpse, which was a boy, had a sign slung around his neck with tomorrow‚Äôs 8am train on it. Besides the swaying boy was his father, and next to him was his mother, and so it went down the railroad bridge, counting off his little sisters and grandmama and so on.</description>

About half have dark hair and rounder faces, as descendants of both inuits and Scandinavians, and others are of mixed ancestry.</description>

As an immigrant, she struggles with school but holds her own on in track and field, an inversion of her otherwise quiet and bookish nature.</description>

It sits on the slope of the wide Vekllei capital basin, where the Atlantic can be seen from the street. It was Tzipora&amp;rsquo;s first home in Vekllei, and it was where she lived with her father.</description>

They do not eat and will live forever, provided they stay within the gardens of the Palace and consummate their industrial godhood occasionally with domen, an opium that they believe purifies blood.</description>

They didn‚Äôt tell it to Rena like that, but that‚Äôs what happened to him. His village and people, the Lehmanen, are descendants of Palace Gods forced out of the heavens some millennia ago over their refusal to smoke Domen, a sort of opium of the Gods and essential practice in the Palace.</description>

In the waning days of the military junta, the beast‚Äôs creators, the Sugarhouse Fort served as a strategic command centre for Vekllei‚Äôs nuclear arsenal and a blacksite to disappear the most prolific and dangerous agitators.</description>

It is difficult to imagine that only fifty years ago these streets were unpaved and impassible with the rubble of old society. Shadows on concrete marked the souls lost in the arrogance of the monarchy.</description>
