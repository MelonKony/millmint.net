<p>On Tuesday, two casualties were reported among Vekllei’s <em>Folifedestarmie</em> 24th and 25th Garden Companies in the ongoing war to make the capital’s parks the finest in the world. Michael Helen-Louisviuan cut his leg on an exposed nail during the deinstallation of old fence posts, and Ana Po cut her thumb on a rose. Both attackers were neutralised appropriately, through planned deinstallation and some mild pruning. The reports were passed onto the local Garden command, where they were filed and will eventually be destroyed after ten years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Vekllei, where a military service of four years is mandatory between the ages of 18 and 32, the purpose of conscription is twofold; first, to ensure the citizenry is at least lightly trained should an invasion follow <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/auz580/the_forgotten_generation/">a nuclear strike</a>, and second; to ensure that important jobs in the country that are not easily automated are always filled.</p>
<p>A breakdown of the most common roles a Vekllei person will enter upon conscription:</p>
<ol>
<li>Construction, 22%</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/aza940/the_sugarhouse_mountain_fortress/">Misc. support roles for the armed forces</a>, 18%</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/a64ahs/the_cosmojet/">Combat roles in the armed forces</a>, 15%</li>
<li>Arts work including <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/c21zvo/hot_summers_in_the_arctic_and_newda_architecture/">architecture</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/a303t0/koka_parks_municipal_recreation/">garden preservation</a>, 8%</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/amoznl/a_story_of_community_policing_and_sweet_militia/">Local policing</a>, 6%</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/a7ltvy/the_suburban_constabulary/">National policing</a>, 4%</li>
<li>Service roles, 4%</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/ab6m9p/on_childhood_and_modernity/">Education</a>, 2%</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/blqcwl/utopia_the_participatory_economy_of_vekllei/">Politics</a>, 2%</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/busvvn/catching_a_steam_locomotive_to_school/">Other misc. work</a>, 19%</li>
</ol>
<p>The garden battalions are not simply the pacifist’s way out — there are many other jobs for principled people. Instead, they appeal mostly to those nearing the end of their eligible conscription age who are looking to get service out of the way before family-making or major career advancement.</p>
<p>In this sense, conscription for most Vekllei people is a rite of passage that mimics preindustrial ritual, and otherwise defines the transition to adulthood in a country that has largely desegregated aged schooling. It is one of the few times in a Vekllei persons’ life in which the organs of power of the country will interfere directly with their lives, making conscription a welcome structure for young Vekllei boys n gals not yet sure what to do with their lives. Indeed, many of the roles taken on during service will echo throughout their working lives, as gardeners become council planners and labourers become robotics engineers.</p>
<p>The truth of automation and work as pleasure is that the unfettered freedom and hedonism of the Vekllei lifestyle can often feel as aimless and agoraphobic as it does liberating. The four years of service in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/98trlw/allweather_combat_for_the_atomic_age/">Vekllei’s military</a> reflect Vekllei in total — both in its confronting usurpation of traditional institutions <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/blqcwl/utopia_the_participatory_economy_of_vekllei/">by petticoat ideology</a> and in its tantalising, insatiable liberty and pleasure. The military will let you dip a finger into that well, and help prepare your posture for the leap.</p>
<p>Caption:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tzipora: “They were telling me! ‘We never planted them here!’ The idiots! Look at it. Tell me that is not a god-damned rose. Sitting under this rock. They must have planted them last spring. I was resting in the sun. That’s how I found it.”</p>
<p>Duma: “Uh-huh.”</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/sex-ed.jpg"/> <p>Porno is available over-the-counter at most book stores. Some industry associations attempt to limit availability to minors but generally it&rsquo;s at the discretion of the shopkeeper. Often, shame and embarassment are more powerful tools than legislation in Vekllei.</p>
<p>Generally it&rsquo;s pretty traditional stuff supported by columns and fiction, although it varies between pornographers. It&rsquo;s quite common for well-known Vekllei models to end up in nude shoots either before or after their fame. Nudity is a little more common in Vekllei than it is in the U.S. (at beaches and so on), and that relaxes the moralising of smut somewhat.</p>
<p>That said, the generation previous to Tzipora&rsquo;s (about 20 years prior, so around the early 2050s) were very sex-positive and deviant. Certain cultural iconography from this time is still used in porno &ndash; heavy makeup, curled hair, bare thighs &ndash; but this has prompted a conservatism among Tzipora&rsquo;s generation towards the &ldquo;vanity&rdquo; and &ldquo;superficiality&rdquo; of their parents&rsquo; sexual liberation and bare skin. Today it is much more common to have skirts below the knee than above it, and pornography is starting to shift to accommodate the fetishistic and fantasy as opposed to outright explicit desire common in the previous decades.</p>
<p>foreign porno, however, is highly prized as a sort of racialised sexual unorthodoxy (especially of Asian or Black men and women, neither of whom are particularly large racial demographics in Vekllei). It&rsquo;s rare to find and not commonly traded. There are very few bureaus that import pornography, and export is far more common.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/decay.jpg"/> <p>Talking about utopia in landscape is easy — <a href="https://vekllei.city/economy/">Vekllei is a glittering midcentury paradise that fosters human life as a wonderful dream</a>.</p>
<p>Talking about utopia in character is much harder. How can you find utopia in flawed and sometimes unattractive human beings? By what metric is the vague, intuitive values of a utopia measured against a living person?</p>
<p>In <em>Upen</em>, the <a href="https://vekllei.city/religion/">nondenominational animism of Vekllei</a>, there is the living principle of <em>Dumousiantopet</em>: “beautiful and seperate”. This is a modernist reconciliation of Vekllei’s <a href="https://vekllei.city/hot-summers-in-the-arctic-and-newda-architecture/">striking, symmetrical and clean <em>Newda</em> architecture school</a> with <em>Upen’s</em> otherwise modest and naturalistic principles. This makes fine sense for cities and towns, in which the triumphant and monumental nature of Vekllei architecture is at odds with Vekllei’s efforts to deindustrialise through post-scarcity, but it also applies to human beings, as natural objects, in society. In Vekllei, architecture is not adapted to its environment, but built in spite of it, as recognition of Vekllei’s human-centric worldview.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, however, Vekllei is a land and people deeply linked with their surrounds, in which purpose and value is drawn from their landscape and nature is an intrinsic part of life. <em>Dumousiantopet</em> does not mean the domination of nature by human construction, but to exist together in segregation of their different systems of beauty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hence the concept of ‘Human Decay’, or <em>Lemdisiandan</em>, a system of human beauty that warps intuitive Western principles (the symmetrical woman, the rational man, the healthy boy, the cute girl, and so on) and worships instead decay, which in Vekllei is a positive natural process that unites all life, including landscape and human beings. Where Vekllei might build a utopian city to last a thousand years, human beauty is acknowledged to be far less eternal; it is in fact fleeting, at once suspended in a single moment and returning slowly to absence, or ‘nothingness’. In Vekllei, it it this process (and how it manifests) in which beauty is found. It is the evidence of life; the symptoms of living; the detail of imperfections in human beings that validate their place on Earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A worn shirt, windswept hair, sweat on your brow — small images of dignity and history in how a person talks and carries themselves.</p>
<p>So how does this manifest? Here is Tzipora Lo Ula Desmoines, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/characterforge/comments/btfqm8/show_and_tell_meet_tzipora_desmoines_the_eternal/">a girl who suffers from Gregori-Heitzfeld Syndrome</a>. She is a perfect example of character utopia:</p>
<ul>
<li>She is very shameful about her body and her thinness.</li>
<li>She is angry at a lot of things and cannot let bad memories die.</li>
<li>She suffers from hypertension after her childhood, and is terrified of dogs and loud noises.</li>
<li>Bad dreams interrupt her sleep.</li>
<li>She is distinctive but well-kept, productive but inward-facing.</li>
<li>She is afflicted with nervous tics that manifest as shirt-pulling and nose-rubbing and has had them for many years. They appear involuntarily in nervousness and pointing them out to her will only increase their intensity.</li>
<li>She has obsessions about clothing materials and the material composition of outfits, which can affect her emotionally (she cannot stand a wool skirt and rayon shirt, for example, intersecting). These bizarre principles include the proportion and length of items, and the tightness and looseness of clothes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This list could go on and on to paint a very uncomfortable and invasive picture of an otherwise quiet and happy person, but these examples neglect the many wonderful things about her — her affection and good sense of humour, her humility and loyalty, and so on. But while these good things might be employed to counteract the bad to us, to a Vekllei person they would accentuate and complete a complex and positive picture of a girl touched by ‘human decay’, an ugly phrase in English that essentially refers to the sweet detail and intricacies that evidence the life of a person.</p>
<p>Human Decay does not glorify anxiety or mental illness — nor does it worship dirtiness for the sake of being dirty, or imperfection for being imperfect — but it does recognise the greatness in the texture and detail of human life. So it is that in Vekllei, splotchy birthmarks and soft skin alike are the characteristics of a beautiful person, and lend to a metric of beauty defined by storytelling and complexity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of how Tzipora would be remembered would be in the way she appeared in the person. She was a good-looking young teen-ager of quiet and unusual movements. As she became known to the wider public, her physical appearance would come to define her as both a phenomena and disability — a victim of blessings; a sweet child of cotton and gingham carrying on in the dark schism between teen-age impetuosity and the adult world of <em>power</em>. What a tragedy and miracle she was.Zelda, which was how she introduced herself among friends, was as intricate as she was indecipherable. She had her own internal logics; a unique carousel of intuition that marked her out as some unfortunate <em>undamoispotet</em> among other teen-agers. In conversation that stirred any emotion in her she was susceptible to spasmodic, defensive movements that distracted from her talking. Most frequently she would pull on her nose as if to wipe it, or reach for her shirt at the shoulder and adjust it. If she was particularly self-conscious, which could be brought on even by the spasms themselves, she would take hold of her shirt and keep her hand there, as though her thin girlish arms could shield her breast from judgement. She confided in her father that she did not like the tics. The more conscious of her imperfections she was, the more her idiosyncrasies flared. He asked her once how long she’d had them — the nose rubbings, the shirt pullings — and she said she couldn’t remember, but thought it might have been after she arrived in America. Which was possible, he supposed — trauma could bring on tics, even laymen knew that. If you spend a while with her, however, it becomes more obvious that her tics are symptomatic of a nervous, fidgety subconscious not cowed by the supposed tomboyishness of her movements — she jigs a leg, and run the back of her hand beneath her nose. Then, when she realises people notice those things and judge her for them, the same synchronistic hyperactivities became shirt-pulling and face-touching.</p>

<p>The <em>Café Resmoiones</em> approaches its hundredth birthday as the girls outside await their fifteenth. The building was once a kindergarten, so they’d been told, but through decades of Vekllei’s irreverent planning it had become a café. It was not a very good café, the food was shit, but the building was nice and it was at the bottom of Lola’s steep residential hill. Locals struggling down it would pool at the bottom and inevitably step inside for a drink. In summer, the café serves seasonal iced drinks to welcome a climate that has destroyed much of the world’s equatorial agriculture but has provided their arctic home a liveable summer. The girls dodge freckles and sip iced coffee as millions around the world flee encroaching deserts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The unstable Atlantic pressure oscillation, of which Vekllei anchors as the Vekllei low pole, can pull in bitter cold from the Greenland currents, or warmth from the Azores tempestuously.</p>
<p>So it is that in summer, on a beach of black igneous sand from the volcanoes of this place, hot rains can descend instantly and beat pedestrians until the rains vanish, minutes later. Winters are equally unstable — they shift between unlivable cold and sporadic thawing periods.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have ever spoken to a Vekllei person in English, you will notice an irritating habit of adding unnecessary vowels to words. ‘Loafer’ becomes “lowiefer”, ‘a ciggie’ becomes “des cigoirettenne”, and the concept of ‘trees’ become “tres foliage”. This is an instinctual artefact of <a href="https://vekllei.city/language/">Vekllei talk, which incorporates vocal gestures to accompany physical ones</a>, even in foreign words. It is also how ‘nakedity”’becomes ‘Newda’, the dominant architectural school in Vekllei, found almost everywhere.</p>
<p>As a sort of post-deco modernism, it retains the striking geometry and vertical movement of more decadent architectural styles, but employs them conservatively to better reveal naked shape — ‘newda’. It is a flexible school that manifests differently depending on the utility of the building. Residential apartments, for example, often display elements reminiscent of constructivism, where national bureaus, or ‘hard buildings’ as they’re called in Vekllei, are more brutalistic. The stripped classicism of buildings of authority stands in stark contrast to the playful googie of utilities like phone booths and public restrooms. These allusions to grand midcentury architecture are domesticated with a unique form of Vekllei populuxe, usually because of Vekllei’s <a href="https://vekllei.city/language/">use of colour and shape as a language in itself</a>.</p>
<p>Some have called it a &lsquo;Paris moderne&rsquo; for the hegemony of the modernist bastards in Vekllei&rsquo;s architecture schools, but to Vekllei people, these space-age  visions of the future are home.</p>

<p>Six bodies hung from the Rodney Creek Railroad Bridge, without names. The leftmost corpse, which was a boy, had a sign slung around his neck with tomorrow’s 8am train on it. Besides the swaying boy was his father, and next to him was his mother, and so it went down the railroad bridge, counting off his little sisters and grandmama and so on. The baby had been thrown in the creek. Who they were didn’t matter much, since the types of people hanging from bridges and trees and lampposts were cut from the same cloth.</p>
<p>Later that night, a man from the Kennecott Copper Company payed a sum of four and a half million dollars in cheque towards three bastards, two pigs and a thug. For that sort of money, you could buy a home to the North and the East, far out of Utah and far out of the violence. Not that any of them would leave — the pigs had good jobs with the Sheriff’s office, the bastards had been born here and would die here, and, well, the thug just liked killing too much.</p>
<p>You could trace today’s nightmare back to the collapse of the Ford Motor Company, but there were problems in the southwest long before even that. The truth of it is that there’s been a lot of anger in Utah for a long time, it&rsquo;s just taken a lot longer than anyone thought it would.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s quite impossible to imagine the tragedy of the U.S. in 2094, where suffering can be predicted by the latitude at which it occurs and midcentury domesticity collides with violence and power. As the U.S. Dollar inflates wildly and the Atomic Age has priced out the working man, is it any wonder that Southerners waste away beneath horizons of the quiet, rusting manufacturing plants of the southwest, where the wind whistles between conveyors once carrying bits of Pontiacs and Fords?</p>
<p>What we saw, as the Dallas Accords failed and the talks of a total secession ascended from fantasy, was the rise of militias, company cities, industrial action, bloodshed, lynchings, racial animosity, the death of suburbs, mass killings, child labour, sexual violence, decaying infrastructure, and so on. The air was electric with opportunity to live out your wildest, most depraved fantasies. Bizarre images of single-story cul-de-sacs and a half-dozen State police excavating portions of desert existed simultaneously. The free flow of immigrants between Mexico and Arizona was quickly seized upon and exploited by companies like Anaconda Mineral and Kennecott Copper, who filled their mines with Latin Americans to shut out striking workers.</p>
<p>An immigrant labourer was dead at the signing of his contract. He was killed by vigilantes, or in a mine accident, or was simply consumed, since these people did not have names and the companies had no expectations of their longevity. That attitude soon came to shadow almost every interaction between otherwise decent people of impoverished communities — that there was no future, that they were the last generation, that the hedonistic cycle of production and consumption had become life itself.</p>
<p>The hedonism of brutality and modern pornography manifested in the violence of the company militias and local sheriffs alike, and so both cannibalism and necrophilia were widespread in oft-secret killings. Desecration of corpses, mutilation of the living, and widespread lawlessness came to characterise the hell that was life in the southern U.S. in 2094. How terrifying it was that beautiful things could decay so quickly.</p>
<p>So it was that men became creatures — lust became necrophilic, suffering became ecstasy. This mad spiral towards our worst instincts came out in full force. The biopolitics of life and consumption became the necropolitics of grotesqueing and subsumption. A girl’s sandal; poisoned bread; leaded cosmetics; copper in the mountains; apricot phosphorous on the horizon; a nuclear family in the current; six Mexicans gutted; six good boys killing for cash; whole towns cashing in and shipping out.</p>
<p>That is life in Utah today. Absolute erotic; absolute grotesque</p>

Jo’s little sister, Popet, has decided age ten and a half that she’ll be a locomotive engineer one day.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you may have learned by now, Vekllei is a land of contrasts. Last year, the Lonne Rail Authority commissioned a new generation of maglev trains for blistering five-minute commutes between <a href="https://i1.wp.com/vekllei.city/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_0555.png?ssl=1">Little Vekllei and the Lonne terminus</a>, turning an otherwise 60km journey into an unconscious gesture. At a top speed of 750km/h, the pride of Vekllei’s commuter rail seems to gunning for subsonic commuter jets head-on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the mountains around Montre, the D-006 steam locomotive approaches her 130th birthday. Where the maglev guzzles direct current from atomic power plants around the country, D-006 chews through bunker fuel — literal scrapings from a barrel somewhere — and leaves soot where she goes. Her train is not carrying businessfolk but log cars bound for the coasts, where they will be sold to Europe for furniture. In the mornings of most weekdays, the engineers and lumberjacks that man her bring their children along for the trip, where the little ones watch the engineer work the cab while the teenagers shiver on her maintenance catwalks.</p>
<p>She is dirty, slow, and makes absolutely no sense occupying a route in the space age, one marked by moon colonies and new empire. What is going on here?</p>
<p>Things begin to make a little more sense through the lens of an ordinary Vekllei person, with their own bizarre domestic intuition and frame of mind. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/blqcwl/utopia_the_participatory_economy_of_vekllei/">Like we talked about previously</a>, Vekllei understands the the achievements of industry as a liberationist tool to return to preindustrial, satisfying life. It is not as though the country will ‘undo’ three centuries of tremendous progress — quite the contrary, in fact. But understood through petticoat ideology, the marriage of labour and the ordinary person can only occur through self-satisfying, personal work. This is in contrast, one can suppose, to mechanised, industrial labour to which we owe our enormous wealth. To a Vekllei person, work is social, productive, creative and satisfying. The simple pleasures of agriculture; specialised craftsman and tradesman; artistry — these are the fruits only of a society that can afford them, since they necessitate the deindustrialisation of agriculture, factory manufacturing and mass media simultaneously.</p>
<p>The steam locomotive is ultimately a fetishisation of this sort of thinking — it is an analogue machine, complicated while comprehensible to the ordinary person (unlike, say, atomic energy or even gas-turbine locomotives). It is enormous and impressive, and also nostalgic for many Vekllei people. In a place and time where money did not matter, as it does not in Vekllei, and productivity was an afterthought, as it is in Vekllei, they make perfect sense. These ‘images’; of rural labour assisted by steam locomotives; of children growing up with these machines; of the constant fetishisation and decommodification of the world — these are currency in Vekllei. That is why this useless machine is a wonderful machine, and why a handful of steam locomotives mother their respective communities decades after their obsolescence.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/character.jpg"/> <p>This is Tzipora. She goes by two names &ndash; Tzipora, her birth name, and Zelda, a name she mistakenly thought sounded less Jewish. She lives in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/blqcwl/utopia_the_participatory_economy_of_vekllei/">Lola</a> in the <a href="https://i1.wp.com/vekllei.city/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_0555.png?ssl=1">Vekllei city-state</a>.</p>
<p>As an immigrant, she struggles with school but holds her own on in track and field, an inversion of her otherwise quiet and bookish nature. She is intimidated by pretty girls and can throw a half-decent punch.</p>
<h2 id="genetic-freak">
  Genetic Freak
  <a class="anchor" href="#genetic-freak">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Gregori babies, as they&rsquo;re called, suffer from Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome. It&rsquo;s usually described as agelessness at menarche, since about 90% of cases are girls. It&rsquo;s essentially a genetic malfunction that puts the body in a cycle of eternal growth &ndash; they effectively continue to grow (without actually growing bigger), but do not develop and are more or less suspended at the onset of their first period.</p>
<p>The question of whether they&rsquo;re &lsquo;mentally&rsquo; children is an interesting one that there&rsquo;s not a simple answer to. Their minds are not fully developed the way an adult human&rsquo;s would be, since ageing stops in early teen-age years and before pubescence. They tend to retain some childish characteristics &ndash; mostly decision-making and emotional control. But this sort of speculation risks dehumanising otherwise very functional and capable people. The effects of long-term childhood and social isolation are far more profound on the personality of a Gregori child than any biological limitation or squabbling about the teen-age/adult schism.</p>
<p>Boys can also have it, but are always hyperallergic and suffer from a broad anaphylaxis at onset of the condition (usually a little earlier, in early thelarche at 8-10y/o). It will almost always kill them. The discrepancy between the sexes is still being researched.</p>
<p>Girls also have a risk of developing hyperallergies. Gregori babies have never developed cancers as far as anyone is aware, and these hyperallergies are a result of this hyperactive immune system.</p>
<p>Gregori babies fulfill the first of two miracles required for sainthood in the Catholic Church. In other parts of the world they are targets of violence as practicers of witchcraft or demonic pacts. The oldest Gregori baby, Tzipora Desmoines, is 120 years old and is set to overtake the human lifespan. She was 13th overall to have been diagnosed, but Gregori children have high mortality rates (largely violence, car accidents and suicides) and she is the first to pass 60 years of age. So, somewhat ironically, the children with speculated immortality almost always die young.</p>
<h2 id="knowing-her">
  Knowing her
  <a class="anchor" href="#knowing-her">#</a>
</h2>
<p>A lot of how Tzipora would be remembered would be in the way she appeared in the person. She was a good-looking young teen-ager of quiet and unusual movements. As she became known to the wider public, her physical appearance would come to define her as both a phenomena and disability — a victim of blessings; a sweet child of cotton and gingham carrying on in the dark schism between teen-age impetuosity and the adult world of <em>power</em>. What a tragedy and miracle she was.</p>
<p>Zelda, which was how she introduced herself among friends, was as intricate as she was indecipherable. She had her own internal logics; a unique carousel of intuition that marked her out as some unfortunate <em>undamoispotet</em> among other teen-agers. In conversation that stirred any emotion in her she was susceptible to spasmodic, defensive movements that distracted from her talking. Most frequently she would pull on her nose as if to wipe it, or reach for her shirt at the shoulder and adjust it. If she was particularly self-conscious, which could be brought on even by the spasms themselves, she would take hold of her shirt and keep her hand there, as though her thin girlish arms could shield her breast from judgement. She confided in her father that she did not like the tics. The more conscious of her imperfections she was, the more her idiosyncrasies flared. He asked her once how long she’d had them — the nose rubbings, the shirt pullings — and she said she couldn’t remember, but thought it might have been after she arrived in America. Which was possible, he supposed — trauma could bring on tics, even laymen knew that. If you spend a while with her, however, it becomes more obvious that her tics are symptomatic of a nervous, fidgety subconscious not cowed by the supposed tomboyishness of her movements — she jigs a leg, and run the back of her hand beneath her nose. Then, when she realises people notice those things and judge her for them, the same synchronistic hyperactivities became shirt-pulling and face-touching.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/square.jpg"/> <p>Nestled between the regional tram offices and the pre-war Ferouistet Department Store, the Lola district is not known for much but her department store and good schools. It sits on the slope of the wide Vekllei capital basin, where the Atlantic can be seen from the street. It was Tzipora&rsquo;s first home in Vekllei, and it was where she lived with her father. The schools were good, the kids were all right, and the trams were a gift from Christ.</p>
<p>Most of Vekllei looks like Lola, marked by her mid-rise streets and public thermal ponds and geyser baths (named after the Vekllei village of Geyser, as it happens). Vekllei people do not generally own cars, and mostly commute via the metro, the exhaustive tram network or on occasion in a loan car from the autopool. The streets are narrow and empty of traffic save for service vehicles, and in the summers they are invaded by neighbourhood children playing baseball or seeking shade under the street trees.</p>
<p>Lola is one of hundreds of neighbourhoods in the vast, densely-populated capital of the country from which it aquires its namesake. It is a city facing its past, now that there is plenty to eat and little to do &ndash; and as a sprawling urban utopia with a fierce nostalgia for preindustrial life, there is no other place like it on Earth. Caught at once between the future of space and helijets, and her collective memories of agriculture and simple labour, Vekllei&rsquo;s petticoat society marks a departure from futurism and a turn to its history, as though the violence and suffering and chaos of the past three centuries were but a chore obstructing utopia.</p>
<h2 id="participatory-economics--property">
  Participatory Economics &amp; Property
  <a class="anchor" href="#participatory-economics--property">#</a>
</h2>
<p>In Vekllei’s feminised parpolity, the revitalisation of <a href="https://vekllei.city/religion/">Upen</a> brought about an ancient understanding of property reborn in the widespread poverty of Vekllei society following <a href="https://vekllei.city/the-forgotten-generation/">the first Atomic War</a>. Widespead social regression and cross-generational nostalgia for preindustrial life took hold in urban Vekllei society almost immediately after the atomic fire, as the ruins of colonial and imperial society lay around the Vekllei people. The monarchy, a tokenistic and fashionable invention of the gilded Mercantile age just three centuries before, evaporated nearly overnight with the death of the king. So, too, did the military junta salivating over the charred remains of the capital find it nearly impossible to consolidate power in a city now without infrastructure. In the ashes of modern industrialisation grew tempered, atomised communities of streets and villages — the common council as we see it today. Food production returned to the city in the ruins of vast factories, wide canals were dug for unmotorised barges, and councils of working people organised self-interest in these communities, which would be understood a century later as <em>Sundress Municipalism</em>. So too did the common understanding of property evaporate.</p>
<p>The old libertarian bugbear of the origins of property was revived — the population had been decimated, Vekllei people were surrounded by vast swaths of useless land of deceased ownership, and the institutions of old society had failed to retake power following the war. The question of ownership was pertinent, as it would clarify the sovereigns of future society. The sovereignty of Vekllei, as it would later be determined, is decentralised and portioned between any land-operating individual, local organisations, municiple councils, and syndicates. This tradition carries on today. In any one apartment building or row-house, you will find the inhabitants, building administrators, local councils and tenant unions exercising types of ownership over a space. In other words; residents of a home will have implied ownership over a home, but a community has implied ownership over the community itself. The intersection of different kinds of ownership result in complex and partially uncoded laws that, although vulnerable to beaurocratic and exhaustive legal disputes, are mostly discarded in place of local opinion.</p>
<p>The foundation of the Vekllei political and economic system is the community; a population larger than a single family and small enough to have valuable social bonds; a group of people bound by common living, work, and recreation. An unruly or criminal tenant is more likely to be run out of town by his neighbours than by the courts. This is not to misrepresent the daily conflicts of Vekllei domestic society — disputes are common and meaningless. But abuse of common ownership is tempered by the fact that it is quite impossible to evict any individual from his home without overwhelming agreement of his neighbours, essentially relegating formal council ownership to irrelevency; the true owners of any single home are, in practice, the community in which it is situated, supervised by protections offered under the local judicial councils.</p>
<p>The ownership of a factory is a lot more straightforward — the old mantra of the democratic workplace is more or less true here. Principally, unautomated (manned) factories recieve production requests from one of the hundreds of different economic bureaus keeping stock of production in the country, which otherwise do not directly supervise production except in circumstance of scarcity. Production requests are voluntary, and usually formalities in the production of items for local consumption. Heavily centralised industries, particularly heavy industries like raw product extraction and refining, usually operate under direct supervision of a bureau. Unions exist independently of the bureau system and usually hold membership from every worker of a factory, including managers. Mirroring nested councils, there are also larger industry unions that generally involve themselves only in general strikes and legal cases without precedent.</p>
<p>The ownership of a grocery store is clear and implied, if not codified. The person who manages and works the shop, either through implied property bonding (so-called ‘folk morality’; a phenomena largely dependent on the person’s social value and local consent) or familial tradition, owns the shop. These are not lawful protections of ownership — indeed, Vekllei common law says very little about senrouive business ownership — but in almost every case, they are validated by a community intuitively. Even antisocial or hostile shop-owners are rarely challenged on their right to the property they manage — the shop is, technically speaking, seen as an extension of the natural landscape (as no more than fired clay and timber), and the live-and-let-live culture in Vekllei is sympathetic to leaving people to their business and shop elsewhere. Legal disputes on the right to live above and manage a store are relatively rare, and usually resolved through ‘blood rights’ ( similar to ‘folk morality’) in the case of an individual or in a more democratic fashion involving multiple relevant complainants, like employees. In both of these examples, the disputed property is considered an entity itself with its own rights and interests extrapolated from its history and surrounding landscape.</p>
<p>Herein remains the distinction between <em>venrouiva</em>/<em>senrouive</em> property, and their implied ownership. <em>Venrouiva</em> usually operate in cooperation with the product bureaus in the case of manufacturing, or other national organisations as their industry requires in education, medicine, power, water, etc. They are ultimately beholden to the direction of the country, as organised by the seats of power and politics. <em>Senrouive</em> exists somewhat independent of the economy entirely, recieving mostly what it asks for and immersing their respective economies in the communities around them. Although all physical material in Vekllei is ultimately property of the country (a vague, naturalistic construct seen as distinct from the government, at least in a Western understanding), <em>senrouive</em>will almost never be managed directly by larger unions or administrative bodies. This distinction does little to articulate public and private ownership, as the very concept of property remains formally unacknowledged in the economy in the country. Instead, all business today is conducted in cooperation with the ideas of community, implied ownership, self-interest and some sort of idea of supply and demand largely usurped by post-scarcity and widespread automation.</p>
<p>Because of this, Vekllei does not actually consider itself classless — Indeed, <em>venrouiva</em> are fundamentally a coordinating class of workers that are atomised from <em>senrouive</em> work through their power and decision-making. They are a class of power in law, education, science, medicine, and politics, and consequently, guide the direction of the country. Although even <em>senrouive</em> business is still fundamentally worker-owned and managed (as part of Sundress Municipalism), this hierarchy remains in principle, even if the quality of life of <em>venrouiva</em> and <em>senrouive</em> workers is in practice identical. This fact is rarely acknowledged outside of technical circles in the country, because it matters very little to the common Vekllei person. Vekllei is not outwardly egalitarian, despite practice, and the problems of power are mitigated by a mess of democratic structures ultimately enslaved to self-interested, independent communities of people. For one of the most centralised countries in the world, with a homogenous ethnic people and culture, Vekllei is better described as hundreds of thousands of hamlets than a single city.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/palace.jpg"/> <p>The Palace Gods live in decadence in an isolated and incestuous land above the mortal planes called the Palace. They do not eat and will live forever, provided they stay within the gardens of the Palace and consummate their industrial godhood occasionally with <em>domen</em>, an opium that they believe purifies blood.</p>
<p>Adult Palace Gods are almost entirely women, but birthrates of boys and girls are about equal. At the onset of puberty, boys can enter rituals to become female gods, but sexual pleasure will stain their transition and thus <em>romentet</em> (as they’re called in god-tongue) will never maintain blood parity with female Palace Gods. Boys who enter sexual acts or allow sexual thoughts will not transition correctly and instead be consigned to serfdom for the rest of their lives (and in the impurities of their blood, they will be dead by forty).</p>
<p>The intersection of the Palace hierarchy and immortality mean that adult Palace Gods are terrified of deposition by younger generations. Older gods will often take an oath of chastity or, failing that, attempt to sabotage the blood purity of god-children to ensure they do not grow up to threaten their positions of power. Adult women often enter relationships with boys for this reason, which will prevent their transition and rise to power and instead grant them mortality. Young girls, however, cannot be dispossessed of their powers so easily. Homosexuality is strictly forbidden in the Palace, and so girls are often tricked into destroying their potential in rituals known as <em>bloodfits</em>.</p>
<p>As inhabitants of the Palace do not need to eat, it means that they do not consume the souls of other creatures. According to their own tapestry myth, their spiritual veganism has come to be a core lifestyle on which godhood is predicated. Young goddesses are often curious about mortal pleasures like food and body functions, and so particularly manipulative adult gods will trick them into eating meat and thus consuming the soul of another creature. After the meat is consumed (the quantity rarely matters, so long as the goddess in general understands they have eaten it), their sin is revealed to them and that knowledge sparks a spiritual crisis in the young goddess that collapses their powers and their physical presence in the Palace.</p>
<p>Where they go is unknown to anyone still living in the Palace — to those unfortunate girls tricked into bloodfit, they find themselves in a land not quite Pachinki (the mortal planet) or the Palace (the central harbour for gods). Instead, there exists a realm constructed of young gods’ ideas of what mortal life might be like, complete with the idealism and fear of the unknown beyond their Palace lifestyles. They begin to breathe for the first time — a terrifying experience to a goddess previously unused to it — and will experience weather, texture, and sunlight for the first time. Their clothes will suddenly have weight, and their wings are now vestigial relics of magic-aided flight. Many girls simply pass out, unable to deal with the shock of reality.</p>
<p>Most stories here end happily though, in a trend unusual for Pachinki and the Palace. The in-between world these goddesses find themselves in is constructed of their hope and curiosity of Pachinki, too. Green pastures of stunning colour and flower-meadows straight out of their wildest fantasies are never far away. A community of ex-goddesses actively look for new girls and help them integrate into the material world. With time, the Palace life simply doesn’t compare.</p>
<p>Uloah, pictured here, is one of the most recent goddesses to be tricked into committing bloodfit. She was unwittingly fed her own pet peacock, and ended up in the salt lakes of the in-between realm. Any god trying to eat for the first time is a messy affair. After a day of desperate tears and despair as she wandered aimlessly, she came across two beautiful goddesses about her age in Palace clothes. They took her to a village with homes made of long grass populated entirely by her kin. A life of pressures and treachery in the Palace was replaced with the simple pleasures of quiet agriculture and play.</p>
<p>So why is so much of the magic of the Palace Gods predicated on myth and tradition? After all, it is not a potion or gemstone that strips goddesses of their power. The truth of it, understood by very few and acknowledged by fewer, is that the Palace Gods are sustained entirely by their own myth, with no future or past.</p>
<p>Princess Torah, the revolutionary ex-goddess that would eventually liberate the mortal Pachinki from the Palace, said as such in her early writings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Palace Gods are not gods because of bloodlines, despite their insistence. They will tell you it is hereditary, and that blood is colloquial for purity, but they are misunderstanding their own myths. They preach immortality, but can be slaughtered like failing livestock if you’d only realise it. They are not gods because they are better equipped to employ ancient magic, or because they have unlocked the secret of eternal life. They are gods because they’ve fallen for the fiction that sustains them — they are monarchs because they believe in the monarchy, they are cruel because they believe in cruelty, and they subjugate because that is how they’ve read the elaborate tapestry their ancestors constructed. So when Princess Moswen, my martyr and humanist sister (rest her soul), descended to the human people and addressed them universally without regard to race or subcontinent, she called the Gods what they were — tokens writing simultaneously their past and future, failing their own present. Waxen, pastel nepotists misunderstanding their fiction as constitution.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/swamp.jpg"/> <p>Rena’s little boy was found in the closest town with his guts turned out and his throat cut. They didn’t tell it to Rena like that, but that’s what happened to him. His village and people, the <em>Lehmanen</em>, are descendants of Palace Gods forced out of the heavens some millennia ago over their refusal to smoke <em>Domen</em>, a sort of opium of the Gods and essential practice in the Palace.</p>
<p>As descendants of Palace Gods, many still carry birthstones in their bodies — small gems buried in the heart of the gut, beneath the stomach. These birthstones are very powerful magical artefacts and fetch a high price in Pachinki’s larger and less magical kingdoms. Rena’s little boy, who was not yet ten, had been taken by pirates looking for his stone and killed. The great tragedy of it was that he was fathered by a man from Zen — the boy had not inherited a birthstone from his mother.</p>
<p>He was her only child and she’d been widowed in the war. The chief of their village announced a month of mourning and fasting in his memory. Once the period had passed, life went on. Rena resumed work in the mineral swamps in which Lehmanen live. The roots and algae that grow in these waters sustain communal village life and produce potions of medicinal value, including leprosy and tuberculosis vaccines.</p>
<p>Two months after the murder of her only child, Rena came across a stone that struck her dumb with shock. It was her boy’s face, unmistakeable in the perfection of the diorite, caught in the terror and pain of his final moments. It hadn’t been there the month before. She waded over to it but found no other indication of its origin.</p>
<p>That boy was only the first. As more people died, and the village went through its cycles of joy and grief, the swamp slowly began to fill with the forms of the dead. Heads of the fog. The Lehmanen were confused and angry by the insensitivity of the mineral swamp, and couldn’t understand why it was happening. Something was intercepting the quiet grief of these isolated people and resurrecting the memory of the dead. Was it the minerals? The wind? Something beneath the waters? Was it even a phenomena so simple as to assign to a single force of nature?</p>
<p>Nearly a year after the death of Rena’s little boy, another head appeared, joining dozens already hidden in the fog of the mineral swamps. This one was identical to the diorite totems before it. But it was unique.</p>
<p>This one was of Rena — and she was very much alive.</p>
<p>Previous posts <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/ar8jov/a_gem_girl_shows_off_her_enormous_strength_in/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MelonKony/comments/azmu94/the_palace_gods_attempt_to_retrieve_their_runaway/">here</a>.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>The Pachinki pangea is home to six subcontinents of old magic, mostly inherited from the Palace Gods, who are worshipped by urban centres to this day. The Lem subcontinent is sparsely populated, as the minerals of its many swamps are rife with disease (an illness contracted here, of which there are many, are called plaguentart in Lem or honeydeath in the Zen tongue).</p>
<p>The Lem are ignorant of the much older magic of the swamps, which predates perhaps even the Palace itself. As stupid to it as they are ultraviolets, the people of Pachinki can only react to the manifestations of it, and will never harness the raw, low-frequency power of ancient harmonics.</p>
<p>— Footnotes —</p>
<p>Pachinki is the creation of a fourteen-year-old girl in my world, <a href="https://vekllei.city">Vekllei</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So Pachinki occasionally lurches into horror otherwise incongruous with the sweet fantasy Tzipora shows such affection for. Pachinki may be a world of peace and wonder, but just like Tzipora’s own present utopian surrounds, it belies a historical context of starvation, mass graves and political violence. Part of the wonder of Pachinki, looking back, is that Tzipora seemed keenly aware of the prohibitively dark nature of this kind of violence in her otherwise escapist whimsy, and this maternal turbulence with her own work is so obvious that even the most casual reader will be conscious of its inconsistency. A page about the pleasure of tasting fruit gems will pirouette into musings on the use of slavery in their procurement and the sabotaging of their production to justify conquest and war. The surreal dissonance of her own motivations for creating Pachinki reflect a girl who was herself living a surreal, contradictory existence — at her time of writing, she was living in a land of plenty and peace, where just a year before she was nearly killed after grocers in Cherry started poisoning their food waste to drive away homeless and vagrants. Her own existence was one of startling contrast — a rapid transition to petticoat society from the misery of the American South, where she witnessed indiscriminate slaughter, sexual violence and crippling poverty. Whatever hurts is real, and so Vekllei did not feel real to her — and consequently, Pachinki is suspended in the same internal turmoil.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/parade.jpg"/> <p>In <a href="https://vekllei.city/introducing-landscape/">Vekllei</a> on the first of each May, the women’s councils and industrial unions wipe clean their banners and flags and join great parades that regale the main streets of the city with song and colour. They carry flags and banners in celebration of womanhood and remembrance of the dead — for those Potter’s Fields and unmarked graves that intern nameless women across the world.</p>
<p>They walk in universal solidarity but not without local identity — women’s unions, called chapels, number themselves. Here Local Chapel № 23, represented mostly by a half-dozen families and a few generations, make their way to the <a href="https://i1.wp.com/vekllei.city/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_0555.png?ssl=1">Little Vekllei prefecture</a>, where the day’s march will take them back to the heart of the city. Little Lili leads the charge with confetti, while her sisters, mother and grandmother follow. They will find it difficult to fit the flags on the streetcar. Her bespectacled sister Patet is sickly and this is the first time she&rsquo;s left the house in five days.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://vekllei.city/the-forgotten-generation/">catastrophe of the first atomic war</a> had set in motion what no protest or revolution ever had — a cleansing of the political and cultural landscape, and a rebirth of Vekllei traditional culture and reestablishment of <a href="https://vekllei.city/religion/">Upen</a> in everyday life.</p>
<p>It is a day where the men shower the precious women of their lives with gifts and affection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although Vekllei is not necessarily a progressive country, and is often a land of absurd contradiction in Western political tradition, Vekllei women enjoy a society built for them. And really built for them too, on an infrastructural level. Womanhood in the country is not defined by commodity or appearance, but by superficially humanist ideas the culture associates with womanhood &ndash; compassion, bravery, intelligence, grace, etc. They are defined not by their relationships or their economic circumstance, but by their friends, political opinions, ability, etc. The decommodification of society has also decommodified womanhood. Vekllei is not simply a good place to be a woman, but is in fact a female country.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/henchmen.jpg"/> <p>She could feel the wind rising. The horizon beyond was warped, caught in the distortion of a forested planetoid before them. The morning sun cast a honeyed warmth on her wings of black sugar, which sang like wind chimes as she soared high above the gem deserts below. Hyssop, her new and only friend, followed her ungracefully under the spell of his flystone.</p>
<p>A chill caught her skull and traced her veins to her stomach, where it seized up. She felt the strength go from her wings and the world tilt out of focus. Her body plummeted, her figure limp, and Hyssop yelled out at her, “Princess! Tora! What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>Her wings trailed her as she fell from the sky, and he dived after her. The sparkle of the sand blinded them as the gems rose into view. They hit the dune in a plume of rubies.</p>
<p>She awoke and emerged from his arms. He was beneath her, dazed in the crash.</p>
<p>“Hyssop!” She screamed. “Hyssop, I’m sorry! Wake up—!”</p>
<p>She cried out again when she noticed two men in fine suits watching over them, like kites and carrion. Hyssop was wrenched from his dreams by her scream and scrambled to his feet. He turned to her seriously.</p>
<p>“Don’t move,” he told her calmly. “Don’t talk to them. Don’t even look at them. Just watch the flystone in my hand, Tora. Look at my hand and the sky. Look, the planetoids are out in their brilliance. Look at their oceans, Tora.”</p>
<p>She looked over the shoulder of the dune and faced the planetoids, but her thoughts were with him. She could admire nothing in her fear. Her knees and palms were pitted with gems and wept blood.</p>
<p>“Hyssop,” she whispered from the corner of her mouth, her face in the sun. A whimper caught in her throat and it coloured her voice. “What are those men?”</p>
<p>“Henchmen of the Palace Gods. They’re looking for you.”</p>
<p>“I’ll kill myself, before I go back. I belong among the living.”</p>
<p>“No-one will do anything,” he said. He sounded undisturbed. He reached behind himself and felt out for her hand, and she seized it and held it tight to her.</p>
<p>“Don’t acknowledge them,” he said, staring the henchmen down. “They are not among the living. Do not speak to them, or you’ll bring them here.”</p>
<p>“Okay. What do you want me to do?”</p>
<p>“Look at the sky. Think of us in Rose, by the sea. That’s where we’re going, when we leave this dune.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never been to the sea,” she said. “That’s where you said you were from, isn’t it? Rose?”</p>
<p>“Sure, Rose.”</p>
<p>“I’ve only seen it from the heavens. I want to see it as a girl.”</p>
<p>“You’ll see it. We’ll just have to wait for the henchmen to be recalled, first.”</p>
<p><em>Princess Tora, Part II, Pachinki Codex</em></p>
<p>-&ndash;</p>
<p>The following is an excerpt from the book <em>Outside Looking In</em>, as prefaced by media analyst and outsider art historian Roy Tesmein.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The author herself, Tzipora Desmoines, would usually describe the henchmen of the Palace Gods as ‘Pinkerton’ — a sort of brutal thug for hire that dealt with asset retrieval and strikebreaking. Of course, the henchmen come from the heavens and are summoned for singular purposes, usually surveillance or sabotage. Tzipora was always very clear on the limitations of the Palace Gods, and their struggles to enter the mortal world, a weakness that inhibited the successful recapture of their runaway princess, Tora. In fact, Tora’s ability to enter the mortal world without the collapse of her mind, as dictated by the schism between planes, was more shocking in itself than her youthful betrayal. In many ways, Tora is a self-insert that witnesses much of the tragedy Tzipora had to come to terms with and rationalise in her early years in the American South. In this context, the Pinkerton moniker makes sense in Tzipora’s mind — just as Tora later attempts to organise Pachinki into a revolt against the Gods (with brutal suppression on the part of the henchmen), Tzipora herself witnessed bloody strikebreaking several times as she rode freight trains on Southern Pacific, a freight company that experienced violent industrial action shortly before its bankruptcy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And further;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So Pachinki occasionally lurches into horror otherwise incongruous with the sweet fantasy Tzipora shows such affection for. Pachinki may be a world of peace and wonder, but just like Tzipora’s own present utopian surrounds, it belies a historical context of starvation, mass graves and political violence. Part of the wonder of Pachinki, looking back, is that Tzipora seemed keenly aware of the prohibitively dark nature of this kind of violence in her otherwise escapist whimsy, and this maternal turbulence with her own work is so obvious that even the most casual reader will be conscious of its inconsistency.

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/fortress.jpg"/> <p>A hundred years ago, the fortress existed as a spectre of the neighbouring villages; a beast of suffering and woe with fingers deep into the mountains around <a href="https://i1.wp.com/vekllei.city/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_0555.png?ssl=1">Montre</a>. In the waning days of the military junta, the beast’s creators, the Sugarhouse Fort served as a strategic command centre for Vekllei’s nuclear arsenal and a blacksite to disappear the most prolific and dangerous agitators.</p>
<p>The Fort was not finished when the bombs fell, and it sat abandoned for a half-century as the scorched fragments of <a href="https://vekllei.city/introducing-landscape/">Vekllei society</a> were preoccupied with <a href="https://vekllei.city/the-forgotten-generation/">their total devastation</a>. It was not until Vekllei’s reemergence as a great power, and one that was convinced of an imminent nuclear war, that the Fort was reoccupied as one of the largest buried forts in the world, rivalled only by the Moscow Metro complex and Cheyenne Mountain’s extensions in the late 2080s.</p>
<p>The Fort is no longer a spectre of the nearby villages — in fact, commute between them is so regular that a special railway has been installed into the heart of the fort, where many thousands of locals work as labourers, switchboard operators, engineers, administrators and research scientists. The fort houses Vekllei’s international telephone exchange, her largest geothermal research outfit attached to Montre University, Vekllei’s nuclear command buried deep in the ganglia of the fort, the auxiliary national railway control, Vekllei’s fourth-largest nuclear shelter system, and many other bureaus of national importance that have been relocated away from the capital city in fear of their destruction there.</p>
<p>The high-frequency telephonics and radar suck so much power that they would cause blackouts in nearby towns if they were both activated at the same time. As a modern all-electric fort with complex electrified munitions transport systems and pumps, her power plants are modern and overhauled every decade or so.</p>
<p>Two supercritical hydrothermic geothermal power plants at opposite ends of the fort operate as primary sources of power. In other countries they would be prohibitively expensive &ndash; high-temperature geothermal sources have a high failure rate and require extraordinarily complex infrastructure to construct. These two plants (<em>Suzie East</em> and <em>Ame West)</em> have wells nearly five kilometres deep (just over 16,100ft), and capitalise on the plate margins of the European and American tectonic plates, which Vekllei straddles.</p>
<p>The fort is inherently outdated in an age of thermonuclear weaponry (although her shelters deep below the Earth are estimated to be impenetrable even to several direct strikes), but Vekllei is not a large country and the viability of mobilised command for civilian bureaus, like that found U.S. and the Soviet Union, is limited. The country has an affection for infrastructure, a fact of no surprise to anyone who has been there, and it is the size of the fort, and its decentralised network of tunnels throughout much of the Montre-Sugarhouse mountain range, that serve as primary defences in the face of a second nuclear war.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This image here is a &lsquo;pocket&rsquo; telegram signed with love. The fort is one of the largest construction projects of the last two centuries, and is a point of pride among the people of the North. In all their agrarian and peaceful living, Sugarhouse Fort has no equal in anything in the industrious South of the country.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/family.jpg"/> <p>We best know <a href="https://vekllei.city/introducing-landscape/">Vekllei</a> as a dense society of utopia and great infrastructure today, but there was blood in that crucible. It is difficult to imagine that only fifty years ago these streets were unpaved and impassible with the rubble of old society. Shadows on concrete marked the souls lost in the arrogance of the monarchy. The nuclear fire was pregnant with a new generation of people, who, in the principles of <a href="https://vekllei.city/religion/">upen</a>, would forge a new society out of the ruins of the old.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Back then girl’s shirts weren’t made of cotton and  you wore holes in your shoes. He was part of the <em>budoinetnoikotet</em>, or the ‘war children’. His parents had lived through the first atomic war, and he was the born in the shadow of it.</p>
<p>In that time the currency had completely collapsed, and so people traded within their own communities in an awkward return to preindustrial life. Often, people’s best clothes were their uniforms, and so that was what they took photos in. This photo sits on the commode in the living room, next to a vase of lilies.</p>
<p>He remembered sour details of his teen-age impetuosity. How he insisted he remove his glasses for the photo, insulting his bespectacled father in doing so. How his mother argued with his sister over the appropriate length of her fountain hairpiece. The women wore their family <em>gi</em>, ceremonial quarter-pleats, and he&rsquo;d had his hair cut.</p>
<p>He thought a lot about his sister, Amelie. She was beautiful and clever and had a weird sense of humour. He’d loved her a lot. She confided in him as teen-agers— about problems with friends, her rampant insecurities, her dreams of the future. It turned out she’d had a beast in her lungs and it took her when she was fifteen. That was how it went back then, in the poverty of the city. To think a hundred years earlier tuberculosis had been a rumour. That is what war does to a country. He was not even afforded the dignity of anger. The English had been right to bomb them.</p>
<p>Life was different now, of course. Vekllei was strong, and although he was not much wealthier, there was more to be had. The country had flourished in the ruins of the old society. Now he watches his own child sport the uniform his sister once wore, and when she smiles at him she looks like Amelie.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vekllei developed rapidly in the face of total destruction. In the space of fifty years the country consolidated infrastructure and its rural population into a powerful city-state of autonomous, rugged agrarian hamlets,  they themselves flowers of the extinct monarchy and  military junta. In some ways it was an exciting time to be alive &ndash; there was now plenty to be had. No-one was hungry. But the children of those interim years have almost been erased from common memory entirely, as bastards of Vekllei&rsquo;s story of utopia and violence.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/airraid.jpg"/> <p>She loved helping out. It was important to her, as an ageless girl of ultimately transient relationships, to be able to establish for herself a family wherever she lived. So within a few years of her arrival in Vekllei, she put time in as a warden for her apartment block and undertook the medical training that went with it.</p>
<p>She carried debts of blood because of how she sold out her friends some years before. She was very conscious of the fact that she was living as a traitor to her old friends. If she was going to die in a nuclear blast — so be it. It would finally be repaid. She had lived a wonderful life these last couple years and had made good use of her borrowed time.</p>
<p>When the war did come, as she always had suspected it would, she was prepared to die in it. She was caught outside when the bomb hit Montre, and when it failed to kill her, she spent three days searching tirelessly for wounded with the rest of the Civil Defense corps. It was only when her legs gave out that she made the long journey back to her father in the capital, to reassure him that she was in fact still alive.</p>
<p>She was awarded for her efforts, along with two others from Montre-Lola. It cemented her place as grandmother of the small agricultural village; the quite librarian from the city who had only the village’s interests at heart.</p>

<p>Although the uniforms got heavier and the commutes longer, Zelda would always like the wintertime. Even in the writhing digits of the city — the subways, the streetcars, the dockyards — snowbanks took the noise. There’s no hurry that time of year. Your feet are wet and your ears hurt, but that’s the price of liberation — to have normal productivity disrupted, usual play moved away. For one long moment — that’s winter — you can spent a while outdoors alone in the city.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/gem.jpg"/> <p>The subcontinent of <strong>Zen</strong> on the <strong>Pachinki pangea</strong> is so weathered by enormous gem deserts that there is scarcely enough space to grow wheat for bread. In places where the soil is too thin for heavy wheats, sparrowgrass is grown. This grass has large heads that can be eaten raw and taste citrusy and acidic as they only grow in toxic soils.</p>
<p>Battered by gem storms, where holy winds pick up stones from the deserts and scatter them, the people of Zen live a hard and honest life. They have forsaken Palace Gods, and have consequently lost a lot of their fertility. Since marriage is dissolved upon failure of a child, Zen has many lonely and desperate spinsters. Driven nearly mad by their childlessness, it is possible to give birth to ‘gem children’ by crushing certain magic gemstones and consuming that powder with normal edible fruit gems. After a short labour of about a month, an extraordinarily painful pregnancy precedes a dangerous birth that kills about half of gem-pregnant women.</p>
<p>The child is undeniably beautiful — with a perfect colour and a glitter like no other, gem children are otherwise just like you or me. They usually find themselves popular among other village children as objects of wonder. In poorer Zen regions beyond the large wheat kingdoms, they are targets for pirates who whisk them away in airships and sell them to slavers on mainland Pachinki, since gem children are prized as well-groomed, beautiful servants of the aristocracy. This is somewhat misguided, as the majority of gem children that live in Zen live an unglamorous, happy life in agriculture.</p>
<p>They are extremely strong — with nearly no limit to their ability to push and crush — but are easily threatened by frequencies that shatter gems. One can easily hold themselves up with a single finger. They move gracefully though and have universally fine motor skills, so they have never harmed a fleshed human unintentionally. Grace here is caught mid-leap to a single handstand. With her fine balance and limitless energy, she could stay there forever if she chooses.</p>
<p>Gem children are kept alive by love, and as long as they are loved by someone — their mother, the community, friends — they will live forever. They also grow up, and stop physically ageing in their early twenties. Tragically, many gem children that are kidnapped die soon after as they are thrust into unloving environments.</p>
<p>Married gem children often move abroad with their partners, since their appearance makes them popular fortune-tellers, spell-casters or oath-breakers.</p>
<p>Gem deserts are mesmerising and a joy to wander, but you must only walk with a low sun or at night. Even in a bright moonlight, the brilliance of the gems can easily blind you for days, sometimes forever. They symbolise Zen as a people and as a landscape, and are one of the oldest shifting monuments on Pachinki.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p><em>Pachinki isn&rsquo;t a normal constructed world. It has its own canon. It is a creation of</em> <a href="https://millmint.net/characters"><em>Tzipora</em></a><em>, who is the character utopia of my worldbuilding project. Soon after she moves to</em> <a href="https://millmint.net/vekllei"><em>Vekllei</em></a><em>, she&rsquo;s pretty friendless and surrounded by pulpy paperback novels. Pachinki is sort of a worldbuilding project within a worldbuilding project, and it belongs to her.</em></p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/militia.jpg"/> <p>As part of sundress municipalism, Vekllei’s villages and townships are mostly self-sufficient and self-regulating. Although a walk in the capital will take you past colossal apartment blocks and cinemas, libraries and schools of great magnificence, you are really looking at a hundred different communities going about personal business at their leisure. The villages are large and concrete now, but the people are are still there.</p>
<p>So does it surprise anyone that the police are just as much caregivers as law enforcement? That’s the thing about cultural matriarchy — even old moustachioed crustaceans like Teddy Roresoin here are mothers in the consciousness of the country.</p>
<p>Teddy came from shipbuilders and he was desperate to avoid becoming his parents. He enlisted in the Navy, but at university his politics soured on dying in some hole in Taiwan and he returned to his seaside prefecture. His office in the station overlooks the dry dock where his parents once worked. In his day it birthed large trawlers of fatty Atlantic salmon. Today it makes nuclear submarines.</p>
<p>He didn’t mean to have a child, much less a daughter, and she turned out to be everything he was terrified of. In Vekllei, they are called ‘<em>Lodoinopotet</em>’, which fits into English best as ‘woman-girls’ or &lsquo;girly girl&rsquo;. It evokes a specific image — a high-school girl with modified uniform, enamoured by useless trinkets like perfume and rouge.</p>
<p>May, his daughter, was not always close with her father but her mother did not stick around long and so it was how it was. She did not intend to become a police officer in school. She spent most of her schooling life having her heart broken by a whirlwind of paper friendships and easy boyfriends. With no qualifications and mediocre grades, she asked her father for a job. She found out she liked it, and the people she policed liked her, too. These days she patrols their hometown together with her father, killing time and making friends. She used to wear makeup heavy like the inner-city girls. She was ashamed of a beauty mark near her mouth. Nowadays it doesn’t bother her much.</p>
<p>One of her favourite of the town’s children is Laura and her brother Rike, which is a brutish-sounding name but he’s a sweet boy. He loves her dad and her father lets him wear his officer’s cap. May’s pushing thirty now and her father’s on the winter side of fifty, and her worries of marrying right out of school are far behind her now — she has enough children to fill a village.</p>
<p>The story might be saccharine, but that’s what no crime and community policing does to constable. It takes these masculine warriors of a community and makes them mums. Vekllei people’d have it no other way. At once therapists, negotiators, friends and guardians, the community police of Vekllei are symptomatic of the wider feminisation of Vekllei society, and their ambition to crest the final age of industry and enter a peaceful, post-industrial epoch of rest.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>If you have any questions, I like questions. If you&rsquo;re new to Vekllei you can check out a website I worked quite hard on: <a href="https://www.veklleei.city">www.vekllei.city</a>. Or check out my profile!

<p>Because the other girls would not stop calling her a lesbian, and because they had realised she was scared of loud noises and made use of that fact, Tzipora struck this bitch and her friend out beyond the football pitches after school. Tzipora was a good fighter — on her side is viciousness and a conviction to fight. That’s usually enough for most teen-agers, who like the idea of fighting but are unprepared for the unglamorous reality of it. But those things do not make up for being short and underweight, and the two older girls had her bleeding on the ground by the time two passing community police-officers pulled them apart.</p>
<p>As an officer examined Tzipora’s head with a torch to find the bleeding in her scalp, one of the girls was desperately explaining that Tzipora had swung first and out of nowhere. Tzipora had nothing for her defence, since it was true and since she did not speak to cops, but the policewomen figured it out for themselves easily enough. Tzipora had been beaten savagely in her foolhardy attempt to get back at her bullies, and her pitiful state made the girl’s desperate blame-passing petty and childish. Although she might have lost the fight, she was not bothered again by the two older girls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Part of the difficulty in understanding Vekllei as a foreigner is in the basic assumptions we make through the lens of modernity. Vekllei has not discovered ‘landscape’, and it has not discovered ‘the Child’.</p>
<p>Now, children have existed since ever, but we live in an age of modernity and commodity — of nuclear power and department stores. The concept of the ‘child’ as we currently identify and understand it did not exist prior to a certain time, in which the rapid accessibility of both industrial goods and luxury in society stripped children of their productive relationships with family and labour, and introduced them to the beast that would become modern schooling. As Kojin Karatani writes about the Meiji Restoration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… It becomes clear that the grouping of children by age in the compulsory educational system of modern Japan signified the uprooting of children, as abstract and homogenous entities, from productive relations, social classes, and communities that had previously been their concrete contexts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, Vekllei is not Japan. Vekllei is caught, instead, between a spectre of modernity and the myth of its past. At once socialistic and deeply conservative, the intuition of the common Vekllei person is going to be fundamentally different to a person acclimatised to foreign society.</p>
<p>Vekllei has a modern compulsory education system like much else of the world, but the way in which Petticoat society is coloured by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/9snaar/the_stewards_of_the_earth/">Upen</a> forces a strange compromise between modernity and Vekllei’s agrarian past. Tzipora, for example, shares a classroom with students both older and younger than herself. Boys and girls wear a single uniform, shared with teachers, all the way from kindergarten to university. Compulsory school operates only three or four days a week and lasts only for a few hours. Work and play, in addition to education, have always been essential parts of childhood in the country and modern schooling has accommodated that. By the time a child is a teen-ager, the person has essentially transitioned into young-adulthood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By sexual maturation, a Vekllei person has essentially transitioned to young-adulthood and submerged themselves in the productive relations of the adult age; they often leave school for work, they quickly drift to mature, independent relationships with parents, and generally marry young.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The consequence of this idea is that Vekllei people often attend some sort of school for most of their lives. Whether trade schools for work or adult learning institutions for personal curiosity, it is very common to fill the many free hours of a Vekllei person&rsquo;s week with education of some kind.</p>
<p>This is not to mislead the reader into imagining adults and children mixing freely, either in compulsory schooling or wider society. Adults do not attend compulsory schools and the median age of a classroom rarely deviates more than a few years either side. But from the perspective of the child, growing up in Vekllei desegregates children from one-another and introduces them to mature economic and social relationships early on, allowing in theory real liberty to choose and work for your lifestyle in the country.</p>
<p>-&ndash;</p>
<p>This scene takes place in a <a href="https://vekllei.city/parks/">Kadesoinan</a> park, as indicated by the offerings bench and concrete paths snaking through water. In the distance is the Lola Neighbourhood School, with its central classroom tower standing six stories high. In the city beyond is Atomic Park and its distinctive, massive sculpture.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/christmas2018.jpg"/> <p>She had always been a very serious girl, from the first time he’d met her. It was more than a reflection of character; it was how she talked, how she carried herself. Her clothes were plain, her nervous tics were not that funny, and she was afflicted with all sorts of fears and anxieties. She opens her mouth in public and what comes out is usually of serious opinion — a judgement of something or a political remark. But that is not how Gregori syndrome works. It does not take young girls and make them old. As the months wore on and the length of the days reflected the passing of warm season, he learned well enough that she was a teen-ager, despite her seriousness. She was slowly domesticated into regular society, her conversation became casual, and she started to worry more about things that might have been inconceivably petty in the months before.</p>
<p>In late November they put up the tree, at her insistence. She was six months a citizen at this point, and not yet familiar with all the familial traditions of the country. But she knew Christmas. And that became her season. This chick, awash with anxiety and domestic terror, was fucking around with ornaments he’d left in the box for five years.</p>
<p>‘Do you mind if I put the angel up the top?’ She asked him. She was kneeling at the foot of the tree with a sample of tree-toppers spread out before her. He looked up from his paper.</p>
<p>‘Why would I mind?’</p>
<p>‘I just thought you might.’</p>
<p>‘Do what you like, I don’t mind.’</p>
<p>She shook her head and shifted back on her rump.</p>
<p>‘It’s no fun if you’re not helping. I have no idea what to do, I haven’t had a proper tree since I was eight.’</p>
<p>He put the paper to the side and rubbed his eyes under his spectacles. He breathed out slowly.</p>
<p>‘What if I make Christmas lunch and you can do the tree?’ He said.</p>
<p>‘No, I’m already doing lunch,’ she said, then in English: ‘Pitch in, that’s how we all do it here.’</p>
<p>She got up and shuffled her feet into slippers and sat next to him.</p>
<p>‘Did you invite Ayn?’</p>
<p>‘I haven’t, yet,’ he said, ‘It’s been a busy week. I’ll ask her, though. She’d be thrilled to be asked.’</p>
<p>‘Maybe I should make a card.’</p>
<p>‘That would be nice,’ he nodded. ‘She likes you a lot.’</p>
<p>She looked surprised and smiled at him, teeth and everything.</p>
<p>‘That’s sweet,’ she said, and tugged at her shirt. ‘She’s sweet. I like her too.’</p>
<p>As Tzipora worked her way into a Christmas fever, he began to like it too. She was better when she was happier — she smiled more, and the compulsion to pull her shirt or rub her nose abated. It was very strange to see a girl he’d known as old before her time suddenly revert five years and adopt a flurry of youth; it was a childish rekindling of the good things in her that might be more accessible if she’d grown up in her home country. He was suckered into the season’s festivities too, a holiday empty in the country of plenty without faith and family. He even attended a mass at Tzipora’s request — she was still deicidal, but she remained a Catholic and wanted to be a part of the fun.</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve Tzipora had put herself to sleep with sickly Winter wine and had curled up on the couch. Ayn sat with Baron at the table and they finished what was left of the bottle as the evening rolled on. He’d lost the nose but still had antlers. She was in a Santa hat and sweet with good cheer.</p>
<p>‘It’s funny, when you think about it,’ she said. Her smile had become small and serious. ‘It all turned out well enough, didn’t it?’</p>
<p>‘It’s hardly started,’ he smirked, and gestured with his thumb at the girl on the couch. His voice was very low as to not wake the girl. ‘She’s got a whole thing planned. She doesn’t want me to know what it is. She’ll happily let me clean up her wrapping paper and wash the dishes, but she won’t tell me what’s going on. She’s got something in the oven, that’s all I know.’</p>
<p>‘Mmhmm,’ she said, and she stretched out a hand and gently laid it across his. ‘But I mean in the scheme of things, Baron. I meant in general.’</p>
<p>‘Like how?’</p>
<p>‘Well, you and I could never marry. And I could never have a baby, you know that. I always wanted a child,’ she said. She squeezed his hand. ‘But here we are, anyway. Think about what it was like when you left for America, and then as it is now.’</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>‘I think about it,’ he said. ‘We’re lucky.’</p>
<p>‘Of course we are.’</p>
<p>He thought about it some more when he got up to carry her to bed some hours into the early morning.</p>
<p><em>Merry Christmas and thanks for a great year.</em></p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/bike.jpg"/> <p>The constabulary is old-fashioned and it can’t last forever. It predates Petticoat-era Vekllei, the previous regime lost to atomic ash, and even the monarchy itself — it was the first community militia of the country and a great deal of romanticism that had been lost in the death of the monarchy has been invested in them. Vekllei people have no gods and no kings; the comfort of tradition is invested in relic institutions like the constabulary. Their uniforms are ostentatious and stylish; they carry ceremonial swords; they guard the nation’s children and leaders alike as part of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/99nhx6/the_constabulary/">venrouiva policing</a>, and so on.</p>
<p>Where community police stations are populated heavily with women and are largely unarmed, the constabulary has traditionally been a male institution with capable equipment. Even now, in an age of petticoat society and integration of womanhood into the economic fibre of the country, the constabulary is still mostly staffed by men.</p>
<p>As they do not make house calls, the constabulary is tasked with defending institutions and business of national importance — everything from schools to petrochemical plants and water infrastructure. They ride in cars or motorcycles. Vekllei still operates many thousands of combustion-engine motorcycles, but there are efforts underway to research all-electric motorcycles that could be refuelled periodically. A pity for constables, for whom the roar of a motor engine is half the fun and symbolises their unique status in Vekllei society, which is nearly totally nuclear-electric.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This woman here is an office lady, as designated by the small <em>gi</em> on her skirt. She’s late to lunch for a friend and only has an hour left. She hails the nearest constable, who helps her with directions. Such is the most extreme encounter most Vekllei people will ever experience with the elusive and romantic constabulary, at least until the second nuclear attack on the country and their rapid mobilisation as military police.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/deadvalley.jpg"/> <p>As Zelda got older and her sense of urgency decayed, the bone between life and death seemed to grow less important as time went on. Could you blame her? She was eighty years old at this point and still as fresh as fourteen — suspended somewhere in the misery of her old age and enthusiasm of her youth. You get a sense of it when you meet her — there’s no urgency about her, no hurry at all. No hurry at all. Just the mild, sweet curiosity of her teen-age appearance and the patience of an old woman.</p>
<p>Since the friends and family of her teen-age years (her real teen-age years) were dead by this time, their spirits had returned to their places of birth. Her mother was in Ula. Baron was in Lola, by the sea. She hoped everyone she loved was at peace. She did not have many friends in her first cycle of life but the ones she did have were precious to her.</p>
<p>In the mountains south of Montre, near the village where she had worked as a librarian for some years, there lies a healthy plateau between monumental basalt ribs. Here is the grave of her mother, long since turned to ashes and returned to the earth. This whole <em>ro</em>, this flower-tundra, was alive with spirits. The <em>ro</em> are important to Vekllei people as the meeting points between life and death. Her mother appears as a cat she recognised from the train station, and the two of them share a space for a while. Zelda never knew her mother all that well, and disliked her for some of the things she did, but eighty years does a lot to the turbulence of grudges and these days she wonders more and more about the bloodline from whence she came and, perhaps some day, she might return.</p>
<p>She pets the cat and talks to her mother, and once it gets too cold to bear, she wishes her mother well and leaves her. Zelda knew there were demons here and didn’t want to spend much time in the <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/ou/#valley-of-the-dead">Valley of the Dead</a> after dark.</p>
<p>She returned home on the express line from <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/ou/">Tiamoin</a> and alighted at Montre-Dupau, where her little country home and the working week awaited her.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/cosmojet.jpg"/> <p>The Ramoin-Dupont H700A “Cosmojet” series are the primary carrier-based fighters of Vekllei. They’re a real bitch to fly. Beloved as they are iconic, variations of the Cosmojet (H600A, B, H500A, etc.) make up the bulk of Vekllei’s total fighter outfit. Unconventional inverted gull wings and embedded turbofan engines make for a striking and uniquely Vekllei aircraft.</p>
<p>And that was the whole point. The first Ramoin-Dupont fighter was always about more than military prestige — it would signal to the world that Vekllei was more than a backwards trough of hamlets and cities. The RD H-series would be an all-nuclear, all-Vekllei fighter. The country had been left scorched by the nuclear exchange at the turn of the millennium. The collapse of the old regime brought about widespread poverty and backwardness. The United States and Europe had emerged with industry mostly intact, and their governments were bankrolling nuclear aircraft programmes. So Vekllei began tentative research into modernising its ageing air force.</p>
<p>The Ramoin-Dupont Aircraft Company was founded by the two cities of its namesake in the cooperative economic boom of the 2010s and 2020s, and the initial development factory and test fields were outdated and burdened by a catalogue of old-fashioned turbojet transport aircraft. The handful of genius engineers in the RD skunkworks set to work, in collaboration with <a class="slink" style="color: rgb(53, 156, 103); background: color-mix(in srgb, rgb(53, 156, 103) 10%, transparent);" href="/factbook/society/industry/bureaus/general-reactor/"><span class="fi fi-min-general-reactor fis"></span> General Reactor</a>, on the new fighter project. As progress was made, the pressure to catch up was eclipsed by excitement as key technological breakthroughs offered Vekllei a chance at leapfrogging conventional military fighters and ushering in a new aluminium-body nuclear fighter. Most crucial were the advancements in Vekllei domestic reactor technology, brought about by General Reactor. Sunburst-style heat exchangers meant lower reactor temps, which allowed for lighter chromium-cadmium shielding and an overall weight reduction of several thousand pounds compared to American and European projects.</p>
<p>After two decades of development, the result was the Aurora. It was still too heavy to properly arm because of the shielding and size requirements of a molten salt reactor. Succeeding generations corrected critical flaws in power management, manoeuvrability, and weight. Fifty years later, the Cosmojet is a direct descendent of that project and stands as the 15th iteration in the nuclear jet programme overall.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The aircraft pictured is named “Lola,” a common girls name in the country. Her nose and forward air intake are painted like a puffin’s break, the national bird. The Vekllei roundel features the logographic character for ‘land of volcanoes,’ the <a href="https://vekllei.city/language/">masculine glossary’s (Loh)</a> hieroglyph for Vekllei. The paint on her vertical stabiliser marks her as the second fighter of her squadron.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nuclear reactor makes the fighter extraordinarily heavy, and despite three powerful engines and an inverse-gull delta wing, the aircraft is most commonly launched by catapult systems, even on land. The indirect air cycle system limits radioactive pollution of the surrounding material and the cockpit is only lightly shielded. Although the reactor saves many thousands of tonnes of jet fuel over the course of its lifetime, day-to-day operations of any carrier fighter require manoeuvrability and reliability. To save weight, the Cosmojet carries only enough chemical fuel for controlled descent using the auxiliary lightweight chemical combustion engine. Her two auxiliary exhausts swivel with the primary flaps, allowing the heavy jet to slow for approach. The iconic inverse-gull wing reduces the strain on landing gear and saves weight by removing the need for fortified (and heavy) landing gear. It also allows for heavy torpedoes to be mounted on the fuselage, which are designed primarily for use against nuclear submarines.</p>
<p>The Cosmojet uses a 2.5MW air-cooled molten salt reactor with an indirect air cycle system powering one chemical-reactor hybrid electric turbofan and two auxiliary segregated turbofans mounted in the wings. The reactor heats liquid metal, which is circulated in radiators by turbopumps and heats air drawn in through the wing and forward intakes. The air is then pumped back into the engines and expelled through one of three exhausts at the rear of the aircraft. In addition, the Cosmojet uses a small chemical combustion engine for take-off and landing and for auxiliary power in the event of reactor malfunction or the EMP effects of a nuclear weapon. The prohibitively strict weight limit means that the Cosmojet only carries enough fuel for take-off and landing.</p>
<p>Vekllei employs nearly 4,000 Cosmojet-series fighters today. All of them are used as supersonic air-superiority fighters. As an island nation with a defensive military posture and a fear of nuclear war, this enormous expenditure is supposed to show results in a global nuclear exchange, much of which will still be delivered by supersonic jet bombers.</p>

<p>The two girls caught a train from school to the terminus, and then a rural line as far as it would take them out of the city. They had walked the granite shoulder of a mountain range for most of the afternoon, carrying only a few mouthfuls of provisions between them. They were both dressed in winter uniforms for the summer hike. The sea air gathered cold and malevolence as it escaped up the range of peaks that chased Vekllei Proper. The girls walked as far as they could with a view of the city abreast before mounting the peak and descending into the flowery plateau beyond the city centre. The path gave way to basalt drumlins and soft flower-tundra. The horizon was marked by volcanic imperfections, and framed a stretch of colour entirely untouched. For only a few hour’s ride from the city, and a handful of foodstuffs acquired from the small village the train terminated in, they had disembarked from civilisation entirely and entered the world of the spirits.</p>
<p>The flower-tundra is like mania; it overwhelms the soul in great colour and ancient presence. Centuries collapse, bloodlines congeal, and suddenly there is a hair between you and your forefathers.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/kokaparks.jpg"/> <p><strong>Between the atomic fire that ruined the city</strong>, and the death of the king, there was a time when the city of Vekllei once resembled its lifeless lava fields to the North. In the communities that gathered themselves in the shadow of holocaust, common agriculture like fruits and berries returned to the city in what they call <em>koka</em> parkland.</p>
<p><em>Koka</em> is the Vekllei word for forest (<em>ka</em>), combined with a prefixtual particle that ‘industrialises’ it. It is usually translated as ‘municipal forest’, and was designed for and continues to serve two purposes in the city today.</p>
<p>The first is that consumable raw agricultural products, like fruits, nuts and berries, were valuable commodity in the starving post-war neighbourhoods that emerged in the ruins of the old city. These foods were combined with bread and meat, staples of the Vekllei diet, to give flavour in a country without easy access to spices and salt. By integrating them into common gardens, the people of Vekllei returned the production of food into a common, shared space that predicated the wider decommodification of the country. To this day, very little fruit is distributed through grocers; it is grown freely and year-round in <em>koka</em> parks in the city.</p>
<p>The second is that <em>Upen,</em> the animistic spiritualism that guides most of Vekllei culture, blossomed in the ashes of the monarchy and revived a real desire to desegregate spirits from urban life. The construction of massive <em>koka</em> parks, filled with food and old trees and free-flowing water, offered an apology to the spirits driven out by industry and agriculture, and invited them to return to human settlement as fellow custodians of the earth. Many <em>koka</em> parks house temples for dialogue with spirits and sprites, and they bless the surrounding neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>To step into a <em>koka</em> park is to disappear from the urban world. Birds warble, leaves whisper to themselves and water trickles sweetly through bright mosses. The largest parks hide the surrounding skyline entirely, and disappear tourists for hours at a time, only to spit them out hours later, confused and exhausted. Any piece of infrastructure, any human touch, is strangled with banners and wires suspending pennants. In keeping with Vekllei Semaphore, a separate language from <em>upotenne</em> and written Vekllei, the flags themselves speak to visitors through their colour, direction and shape. The effect of being swallowed by a <em>koka</em> park is detoxifying and luxurious — and by the time your lunch break has ended, you are fed and at peace.</p>
<p>-&ndash;</p>
<p><em>If you have any questions, let me know!</em> You can read more about Koka parks and learn all about Vekllei at <a href="https://www.millmint.net">www.vekllei.city</a>, which has just been redesigned and I think it looks pretty amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Post Scriptum</strong>: The figure in this girl, Tzipora Desmoines, is in her second week in Vekllei in this picture. Timid and isolated through her sudden immigration, she makes her way through a koka park with a guide she can&rsquo;t read, fretting about which tram she has to get back home.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/guilt.jpg"/> <p>Some years ago, she was in the desert. At the time she had just fallen out with her lover, and their friends had sided with him. The reasons why they had sided with him seemed to matter less and less as time wore on —  they might have always liked him better.</p>
<p>They were self-styled anarchists waging war against the Indian Springs Sheriff’s Department, who operated one of the larger camps north of Las Vegas. Fashioning themselves as martyrs, they carried on in the spirit of Sacco and Vanzetti.</p>
<p>Tzipora had been growing tired of fighting. There had been an outbreak of botulism not far from where they were camped out, and she was worried she might catch it. She wouldn&rsquo;t survive it if she did, because her body was wasting as she slowly starved. The folks they used to steal from had fled the fighting.
Once her lover had left her, and her presence began to irritate the small group, she left one night and walked to the local Women’s Auxiliary, a barracks of women and girls supporting the marxist stooges in that part of Nevada. It was impressive to the fourteen year-old  —  the dusty desert outpost was flush with Soviet-made rifles and medicine, with rations aplenty. As she enlisted, she thought of her abandoned comrades. She was filled with anger and jealousy.</p>
<p>She told her garrison leader, a man with an accent from somewhere on the East Coast she couldn’t quite place, about how she and her skilled anarchist friends had been at waging guerilla war against the secessionists. Then, in an act of spite, she mentioned that her old comrades had stolen supplies from an Worker&rsquo;s Reunification Party camp. Perhaps, in her silly little head, she had wanted to see them brought under control and disciplined, and she would finally be satisfied after their cruel words and coldness.</p>
<p>Michael and Lenny, two friends, leaders, and one an ex-lover, were picked up by a WRP patrol and shot in the head in their prison cells. The KGB, which was supporting the WRP at that time, gathered up the rest of the anarchists, six in all, and sent them to a detention camp in Utah. Tzipora would not see any of them again.</p>
<p>The same day she found this out, she was singled out at morning assembly and awarded for her efforts in front of the entire Women’s Auxiliary. When she returned to her bunk, she found a hundred pairs of eyes on her, and her meager possessions thrown onto the floor. She slept outside as a traitor that night, and would leave soon after.</p>
<p>Blood does not wash off her hands. The shock of her childish mistake gave way to extraordinary self-hate, and some sixty years later she is still coloured by queasy, anxious guilt.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/scout.jpg"/> <p><strong>About half of Vekllei kids</strong> go through the &lsquo;Blossom&rsquo; network of youth orgs at some point in their lives. Yeah, youth groups are popular nowadays. The Boy Scouts and Girl Guides of the United States are as mandatory as schooling in some states, and various Red Pioneers around the world test orthodoxy in Soviet and Red Chinese children.</p>
<p>The Girl Guides of the U.S. now boast catalogues of several hundred pages, selling thousands of Guides-branded items to their own members and Guide-friendly suburbs. Outwardly, the cartoons of Heinz and Carpenter (both of <em>Western Family</em> <em>Magazine</em> fame) might show off Guides assembling tents in jigger jackets and bright sashes, but they always seemed to neglect the impoverished girls priced out of the Guides organisation, like was so common at the time. There were a lot of poor girls in America by 2083.</p>
<p>Things are not much better for the Boy Scouts, who are only a few lethal armaments away from becoming paramilitary. They worship the flag and guard America’s character. Following the catastrophic Sino-American nuclear exchange, the Boy Scouts were enlisted in Civil Defense, an order that would kill many times more boys than the bombs ever did. You had kids being killed protecting grocers in food riots, and disappearing en masse as the cities collapsed. It was absurd.</p>
<p>So in the search for an analogue to Vekllei’s Blossoms, do we have any choice but to look to the Pioneers of those miserable countries of the East? After all, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/9dikf6/shot_like_a_dog_in_a_supermarket_the_vekllei/e5hwuay/?context=3">Vekllei has no money to spend</a>, and no flag to worship (the domestic standard is a simple red rectangle, the international standard is decorated). Perhaps the Blossoms, a relatively decentralised organisation for a youth group, has no real comparison in the world today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Boys and girls of schooling age can join unisex troops</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(the literal translation of the word is ‘barracks’, but in Vekllei it lacks the military connotation)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and they will receive a uniform of wool, lisle cotton and nylon blended advanced fabrics. On their person they carry binoculars, twine, and tools of various utility. On hikes they often carry air rifles for small game hunts; most every Blossom will learn the basics of gun safety and shooting at some point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The real emphasis of the Blossom network <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/9snaar/the_stewards_of_the_earth/">is in the naturalist spiritualism of the country, or Upen</a>. Blossoms are taught about agriculture, food production and consumption in their society. Most troops enforce ‘catch-kill’ rules: if a troop member wants to eat meat, they should kill, skin, and clean the animal to illustrate the relationship between consumption and exploitation. Environmentalism in the organisation is broad and humancentric. Although environmental science and the geology of the country is taught, most camps place emphasis on rural infrastructure, <em>roupoismentet</em> (or &rsquo;local living&rsquo;, a word for agrarian communities), and the place of spirits in Vekllei’s domestic affairs. This is not to portray Vekllei as an overly vegetarian or sentimental country &ndash; just that Upen is a part of life for Vekllei children, and contributes to their understanding of the world.</p>
<p>Many Blossoms pursue employment in the Armed Forces upon leaving school, as a natural extension of the organised lifestyle of a youth org. This is not to say that life in the Blossoms is particularly militaristic &ndash; Vekllei does not actually have professional culture, despite hierarchies, and so life in the Blossoms is casual fair, and like the rest of the country, largely individualistic and self-satisfying. Boys and girls go on camps, eat food out of a can, sleep under the stars, collect badges, fall in and out of puppy love, learn to assemble a rifle, meet wild animals, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tzipora perches on a tree stump as her friend rushes to steady the camera. She surveys her domain. The flower-tundra from here to Montre was uninhabited. Society had been stripped away and they were fellow creatures of the forest. Her friend places the plaque with her name and year on it at the foot of the stump, and Tzipora adopts a masculine pose typical of her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m still fleshing out the ideas in this post, so let me know if you have any questions. Like always, you can sort my profile by posts for more info. You can read more about the project at <a href="http://www.vekllei.city/">www.vekllei.city</a>, although that website is still a work in progress. It’ll do for now.</p>
<p><strong>This is a quick reupload:</strong> the first image had a great big bloody line through it, and I just couldn&rsquo;t unsee it. <a href="https://vekllei.city/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0549.png">This is what it looked like. LOOK AT IT. IT&rsquo;S SO OBVIOUS ONCE YOU SEE IT.</a> Sorry folks.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/spiritstewards.jpg"/> <p><em>Upen</em> is the animistic religion of Vekllei. It doesn&rsquo;t have priests, but it has ceremony, and it shapes every part of the country today. From apartment cooperatives to the types of cotton used in clothing, <em>Upen</em> has extraordinary reach for an ostensibly agnostic and secular country.</p>
<p>It works out that way because Upen is not an organised religion, and resembles more closely a collective spiritualism with supernatural beliefs. It is not incompatible with theism, a quirk we&rsquo;ll explore below, but it manifests outside of churches in the passing of seasons, code of dress and rural egalitarianism.</p>
<p>How exactly a person goes about their animism is their business, and depends on personal faith. Most Vekllei people are atheistic and believe there is another plane of existence which houses their ancestors, spirits, sprites, and demons. This is reflected in how they see the world:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>​Upen, as atheistic and animistic, shelters the landscape from becoming ‘simply nature’, as it does when viewed as a product of a monotheistic creator god. To these people, agnostic of &rsquo;landscape&rsquo;, nature is not ‘simply nature’; it is a spiritual vessel in itself, inalienable and inextricably linked to human purpose and satisfaction. Industry is divorced from the whole concept; it is a country of forest commons, collective stewardship, and volcanic unrest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not always easy to reconcile the basic assumptions Upen makes about the world. Viewed through Tzipora’s nonpracticing Roman Catholic lens, the mess of her religious beliefs look something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>There is a single creator God</strong>, who took on man’s flesh as Christ. He</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(and in her mind, it is most certainly a He)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is not omnibenevolent or even totally omniscient. Humans, as weak and mortal, must obey Him until they have the power to usurp Him. He is a guiding force of the world. Spirits, as physical manifestations of the landscape, are fellow travelers on this planet and should always be treated with respect, as humans are guests. With a fragile, physical form, it is a uniquely human burden to cultivate and protect the land, and actualise their purpose as a species.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, to dissect her version of Upen, we have here four (five) different characters in the spiritual world:</p>
<p>First are <em>spirits</em> and <em>sprites</em>, which are the souls and fabric of the forests and hills. They are as old as the Earth itself and predate humans by billions of years, a fact that seems implied when you are joined in physical presence with them. They treasure, and indeed, embody the Earth and can reap wealth or chaos among us. Spirits take many forms, sometimes anthropomorphic, sometimes only partially corporeal. This one here has collected jewellery, gold, and peratin leaves, as they are fiercely attracted to precious metals. Just as we dress up for them, peaceful spirits will dress up for us and mimic parts of our bodies. <em>Sprites</em> (as opposed to spirits) are smaller, more emotional, and are fragments of reproduction &ndash; think of them like spores of ferns, of the pollen of flowers. You can see a small one floating beside the spirit.</p>
<p><em>Christ</em> was the first and only time that God is recorded to have walked among the living. He might visit the spirit world often; Tzipora wouldn’t know. As a creator and guide for humans, He was born as a human and taught ways to live well. Humanity is very young and is still learning to live on the Earth. The ritual of communion is a way of reminding us that We are in His image, and We are unworthy. He died for our sins; sins Tzipora is very sure will eventually usurp Him altogether in whatever deicidal sci-fi utopia she&rsquo;s got going on in her head.</p>
<p>Then, there are <em>humans</em> themselves. Here, Tzipora is in full costume designed for religious ceremony to talk to spirits. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/8lqzuj/the_dress_code_for_talking_to_spirits/">You can read more about the costume here</a>. She might ask for rains, or a long summer, or for the forest to return a missing child. Food offerings are presented. She forms a whole rune with her body as part of <em>Upotenne</em>, or the language of spirits. <em>Upotenne</em> itself is an ancient type of <em>Potenne</em>, which is modern Vekllei sign language. This is a calming rune, indicating maternal affection, and you can see the written hieroglyph appears visually similar to the pose.</p>
<p>Finally, demons walk the Earth and can manifest in many different ways. This one has taken the form of a girl, and carries the severed head of a goat. Its eyelids are painted with ritualistic eyes in mockery of proper funeral rites. They often wander aimlessly through uninhabited areas, as noise in intolerable to most demons. They are mysterious creatures, and their purpose is unknown. They come from the place spirits go to die. Like apex predators, they wander aimlessly and without purpose, hunting and feeding at random. They are feeble in physical forms, with one exception: they can form physical runes quickly and maliciously. The one cast here is an omen of suffering (translated literally as &lsquo;harpoiseanin&rsquo;, or overpowering the body with its own stomach acids). In Vekllei, a &lsquo;demon&rsquo; is any biplanar or otherwise supernatural creature that takes corporeal form and harms folk directly. Spirits can maim and kill, but only through the forces of nature &ndash; a demon attacks physically. There are many types of demons, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/97sckc/old_dead_demons_still_wander_the_countryside/">and you can read more about them here</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about Upen, just ask. You can read more about Vekllei by clicking on my profile or visiting <a href="http://www.vekllei.city/">www.vekllei.city</a>! Thanks for stopping by!</p>
<p>-&ndash;</p>
<p><strong>Post scriptum</strong>: Upen is also the reason Vekllei does not recognise either private or public property, and was actually the inspiration for making this post. Although many people exert &lsquo;ownership&rsquo;, the concept of property as something other than &rsquo;nature&rsquo; is not recognised, and so society in Vekllei remains thoroughly decommodified. Looking at Vekllei through the lens of Upen, it becomes clear that a moneyless domestic economy is not the product of grand secular collectivist ideals but a natural extension of egalitarian environmentalism; essentially urbanised agrarian socialism.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/militaryfashion.jpg"/> <p><strong>Unlike the United States and Western Europe, the ‘teen-ager’ has not been discovered in Vekllei.</strong> To be pedantic, they do technically exist  —  their people do indeed enter a transitory stage between childhood and adulthood, as far as anyone can tell —  but they do not exist as a separate cultural identity. The teen-age person in Vekllei is immersed in adult economic and social relationships, and so they have no real cultural material of their own. They listen to the music of their parents, raise younger siblings, and generally marry young. I could go on for a while about things Vekllei has not ‘discovered’ (read: commodified through modernity); landscape, childhood, history, etc. But let’s stick with teen-agers for now.</p>
<p>By sexual maturation, a Vekllei person has essentially transitioned to young-adulthood and submerged themselves in the productive relations of the adult age; they often leave school for work, they quickly drift to mature, independent relationships with parents, and otherwise carve out lives in their wondrous country. All of this is not to say that the country lacks materials aimed at young people entirely  —  you can’t fit a middle-aged woman into a sixteen-year-old’s dress, no matter how much she might try  —  but I am simply trying to establish an understanding that folk here do not enjoy the glamour (or what was once glamour) of American teen-agers, with sock-hops and convertible cars and magazines.</p>
<p>Tangentially related, as Vekllei society has militarised in the face of nuclear war, so too has fashion adopted a bayonet’s edge. In womens fashion, we’re seeing the reemergence of ‘dazzle’ camouflage in imitation of her great capital ships. Jackets, skirts, jewellery, hats, are all being manufactured in flavours of it, and are often <em>touspian</em> or ‘pastelised’ into designs and colours considered more feminine. In men, military caps and ties are popular in semiformal social outfits, and often complement suits. The country is already heavily uniformed in the workplace, and has a passion for badges and armbands and decorative knick-knacks, and so a lot of these authoritative trinkets are trickling into everyday fashion.</p>
<p>It’s easy to despair at the militarisation of society, and a warhawk fashion culture, but it could also be seen as a critical modernist/postmodern attack on the traditional institutions that are so integral to life and culture in Vekllei society. In sharp dresses women wear armbands embroidered with brands of soup, men wear faux-military badges displaying ridiculous illustrations  —  while not outright political perhaps, they are certainly appropriating the imagery of war and domesticating it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tzipora here is sixteen, waiting for a first date, and patterned with the dazzle of the <em>Sundress</em> nuclear-equipped capital ship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven’t really felt out my thoughts fully on the subject of teen-age life and its introduction to Western society, so if ya got any ideas leave a comment. I’m also building a website, <a href="http://www.vekllei.city/">www.vekllei.city</a>, but it’s a bit shit at the moment. I’m slowly cementing its style and turning it into a proper wiki, so check back soon!</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/southerncollapse.jpg"/> <p><strong>In October of 2074</strong>, the Ford Motor Company was embroiled in political catastrophe after Vermont senator Henry Walsh accused unionism in its East-Coast plants of traitorism by allowing foreign spies to acquire jobs in the Company. Whether the spies were Soviet or Chinese changed several times in Walsh’s accusations, but the claims themselves were not entirely unfounded. An investigation by the FBI received by congress found that several high-ranking Auto Workers Union members in Ford plants had connections to communist organisations, which were then discovered to have smuggled foreign agents into the country.</p>
<p>The recognition of Ford as a traitorous company, combined with an ailing combustion-engine automobile catalogue, sank the company into receivership and then bankruptcy. In a few short weeks, the titan of American industry, and the grandfather of mass-production, had ceased to exist except in name (which was acquired by Chrysler and branded tokenistically on several models of Chrysler vehicles).</p>
<p>Forty-thousand jobs disappeared by the new year. The economy was bad and the plants of the company were unsold and were bleached by the sun. The Southern states, which had served as primary hubs of the auto industry after Detroit’s collapse a decade before, saw unemployment jump ten percent. Is it any surprise what followed?</p>
<p>It would be misleading to categorise everything that has happened since as a consequence of the Ford Motor Company’s collapse, but in the minds of most Americans  —  and most importantly, blue-collar men of the Southern States  —  it was the beginning of the end for the Union, and the secession of the Southern States from the United States four years later had rolled off the back of the economic collapse spurred by Ford.</p>
<p>Hungry and anguished by economic collapse, and increasing fragmentation of Southern culture as cities, companies and universities diversified culturally, Southerners found conspiracy in many sectors of modern American life. There were Jews, who controlled big money in the East Coast cities and relished the South&rsquo;s failures. There were capitalists, who were often conflated with Jews as enemies of the noble small business community. There was the Federal Government itself, and a cabal of socialists, communists and leftists who had wrought their jealousy upon the south. And there were blacks and hispanics, who were brothers in victimhood or conspirators depending on what county you were in.</p>
<p>Although the South would gain some measure of independence after the heat of the fighting had tapered out, the Southern States would never fully recover, and both the secessionist and Union states continued to maintain a single U.S. military.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/olduniforms.jpg"/> <p>From preschool to university and beyond, all students wear a variant of the same uniform. The kindergartners may not wear a full <em>gi</em> and camisole pinafore, but the basic ensemble is still there. This is the girl’s one, and it’s much more elaborate than the boy’s uniform.</p>
<p>Year-round, all students wear a <strong>school armband</strong> with their year and class embroidered on it and a <strong>badge of education</strong>, which is pinned to the top button. Girls wear a selection of other traditional items.</p>
<p>The <strong>gi</strong> is a ceremonial quarter-pleat worn by schoolgirls and the wider public generally. It is usually embroidered for the festival month it was made in, and many Vekllei girls have several gi for different celebratory months (birth month, blood month, shipbuilder’s month, etc). In summer it is also common to wear a <strong>sun petticoat</strong>, a delicate lace petticoat worn exposed beneath the hem of the skirt. These are often handmade. Traditionally hair is pulled into a <strong>fountain hairpiece</strong> if it is long enough, and can accompany <strong>temple hairpieces</strong> as well. These hairstyles trace back to the spirit priestesses and have become fashionable again.</p>
<p>In winter, both boys and girls wear a <strong>half cape</strong> for Vekllei’s miserable winter months. These are usually wool and lined with insulating materials. Girls also wear a <strong>camisole pinafore</strong>, which is essentially a traditional girl’s camisole that is tucked into the skirt to make a dress for the winter months.</p>
<p>Armbands, badges, half capes and gi are worn in many other industries as well, since nearly every company employs a uniformed staff. It is common for a girl to hold a gi from her middle-school years, where it is oversized and clumsy, all the way to graduation and then employment.</p>
<p>For those wondering what happens to valuable metals and gemstones in a moneyless society like Vekllei, you simply have to look a little closer  —  they are often sewn into badges and ceremonial clothes. Stripped of their commodity, they have become precious and sacred items that bejewel important objects. The badge of education, for example, contains a ruby in its heart.</p>
<p>None of this stops roughhousing, and Tzipora’s just beat the shit out of a girl who called her a lesbian.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/endgame.jpg"/> <p>A single hiss, the heavy door rolls back, and it derails into sandbags. A gas piston grinds, an engine ignites, and a roar sends flames pouring fifty feet high out of the silo as a sleek missile emerges and climbs towards hunting altitude.</p>
<p><strong>This missile will strike Lanzhou, China</strong>. The larger cities, swollen with people, are protected by antimissile laser batteries. But China is very big, and there are not enough lasers, nor enough power, to shield the entire country from missiles. This missile will extinguish 42,000 people instantly, in a ball of hot fire, and kill anywhere from 250-750,000 moments after as the city is ripped up like paper. Along with other missiles from the U.S., Vekllei, and Europe, this missile will irradiate the Yangtze and set fire to great swaths of farmland. Lanzhou will be a crater, her neighbouring villages will be on fire, and the scraps of her people that survive will drift elsewhere, this land scorched. Famine will set in, radiation will poison her children and ensure that future generations living in the great land that was once China will be primitive and factional for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>The Chinese, too, will do good work destroying America. Where missiles are zapped out of the sky, bombs are sent into freefall from jets, and they erase the heart and culture of American cities and industry.</p>
<p>By the end of it, three hours later, 1.4 billion people will be dead or taken ill, ash will rain from the sky as huge fragments of earth cycle across the Northern Hemisphere’s atmosphere, and the thyroids of the global youth will get to work soaking up radiation in the vast wastes of North America and East Asia.</p>
<p>Vekllei, as it had always known it would, emerged flustered and unharmed. It had lost 23,000 people to bombs, one in the city and one near Montre, but her food stock was secure, her population was underground, and so her diplomats set to work resuscitating the U.N. and organising relief to the globe. Such remarkable attempts to save face, hands still warm with Chinese blood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And future generations would condemn the use of missiles in the last great war of the 21st century — from the defunct U.S., from defunct Red China and the Warsaw Pact, and especially from Vekllei — but it made no difference to how things played out. With one stroke of a match, the world’s great civilisations had collapsed and petticoat society was on that global horizon. Like how Vekllei had known it would be, and like how it was meant to be.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/comix.jpg"/> <p><strong>There are some comics that Vekllei syndicates just won’t publish</strong>. <em>KID Magazine</em>, or <em>KID Comix</em> ran for nearly a century. It was picked up and dropped by dozens of anonymous artists, writers and editors, all operating under nonsense pseudonyms  —  Red, Squick, Failson and Daddy Fun were some of the longest-serving. It would go out of print for years, until some contributing artist would revive the mailing list and recruit new editors and writers. Not even editors knew the names of their team  —  and so <em>KID</em> became a rag-tag, pornographic, angry, satire comic published anonymously anywhere from biannually to a dozen times a year and distributed through universities, underground comics syndicates and workplaces. A single copy might be repressed dozens of times and redistributed further, making original copies collector’s items.</p>
<p><em>Issue 36</em> blasted Vekllei munitions trade with the United States, which was by this point gripped by economic collapse as the industrial centres of the South were levelled by poverty and fighting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The comic is not subtle: a stereotypical Vekllei girl complete with <em>gi</em> and fountain hairpiece offers an artillery shell to a deformed pigman soldier carrying the U.S. flag and an atom bomb. The girl wears the national flower on her apron. The pigman sits atop a throne of food and corpses, as he himself decomposes. Subtitled in English by Squick: “Just let the fucker DIE”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article inside parodied the sitting U.S. President, W. E. White, using Vekllei munitions as sex toys before one of them detonates and he flies off into the moon.</p>
<p>Such was the tone of the magazine, one of the most important examples of underground comix culture in the world and a landmark training ground for successful comix artists.</p>
<p>Post scriptum: Tzipora was introduced to <em>KID</em> through a contributing writer at her university. As a fluent English speaker she served for some time as <em>KID</em>’s first and only English editor, and would later contribute both art and articles to the magazine.</p>

	  <![CDATA[Just a few notes on what it means to be a man in Vekllei.
Vekllei is a country at odds with itself. On one hand, it is universal in its politics and fundamentally internationalist; on the other it is a deeply traditional country that values bloodlines and heritage. It is a secular democracy that regularly alludes to monarchy in its rituals and symbolism. It is a culture that is so casual it offends foreign visitors while retaining strict codes of conduct.]]>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/masculinity.jpg"/> <p>Just a few notes on what it means to be a man in Vekllei.</p>
<p><strong>Vekllei is a country at odds with itself</strong>. On one hand, it is universal in its politics and fundamentally internationalist; on the other it is a deeply traditional country that values bloodlines and heritage. It is a secular democracy that regularly alludes to monarchy in its rituals and symbolism. It is a culture that is so casual it offends foreign visitors while retaining strict codes of conduct.</p>
<p>Vekllei is unique in that it is one of few Western countries with strong matriarchal tendencies. As part of <em>petticoat feminism</em>, it explicitly states as such: the default disposition of the human race is <strong>‘female’</strong>. That is not to say that men are robbed of masculinity or women are stripped of their femininity  —  both roles in Vekllei society have pervasive roles and stereotypes, and are lived out every day by millions of people. Instead, it means that over the course of hundreds of years, and the inevitable triumph of Vekllei over whatever those years will bring, ‘man’ as a concept will cease to exist. After all, femininity has nearly absorbed all masculine traits in Vekllei already  —  warrior culture, casual mateship, profanity and drinking, etc. Petticoat feminism, and by some extent petticoat socialism, understand masculine figures as an economic and social product of a previous age, and consequently, to co-opt some business newspaper slogan, “<em>the future is female</em>”. As the economy is revolutionised, and the country is rebuilt over and over again, so too will it leave behind the economic products of “old society”, a phrase that in Vekllei has very specific connotations (namely, the years of monarchy followed by authoritarianism).</p>
<p><strong>Tzipora’s father is a man’s man</strong>. He is a product of a dying generation. He wears his pants too high, the fit of his suits are loose, and he has spent his life in authority, surrounded by critical decisions that require his attention. Yet even he carries in his heart petticoat culture  —  he has raised two daughters, and they have ‘feminised’ him, in a sense  —  not in a way that makes him ‘weak’ or ‘emasculate’, but in his ability to interact with wider petticoat society.</p>
<p>I’ll close with a letter from his oldest daughter, on the subject of Tzipora and her relationship with her dad:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He’s a good father, and a good man  —  an excellent man, in his later years. He’s a hard worker and radiates masculine authority, like many of his generation, but he was also forced into progressivism by the fact that his entire family at the end of his life were women. A man like that can’t choose to be picky about what he does and doesn’t hear concerning the personal and biological intricacies of womanhood. And this girl, this little Montre chickette he is telephoning, was the worst of them all! Thank God he was an affectionate father to her, even more so than he was to me, because the things she would tell him about! Her suspected lesbianism, her flirtations with bolshevism, and that’s not to mention the difficulty she had making friends at school, a wound that she scarcely hid from him. Yes, this man was all she had! Girls like me, good blood daughters, we have our women. Zelda, bless her, had him. I ask my girlfriends to brush my hair to get the knots out  —  Zelda puts her hairbrush on his desk and waits patiently until he can’t ignore her anymore.</p>

<p><strong>A fluorescent light burst on Thursday</strong>. She was stacking cans for a display. The girl was working alone that evening and leaving her mark everywhere  —  happy apple drawings, new posters, displays  —  she liked the job.</p>
<p>The light burst like a gunshot and she leapt to her feet. Down the aisle she saw herself, at the lowest point in her life, standing over an old friend. To say she had shot him would be misleading  —  she had executed him, point-blank. He was bleeding into the sandwiches with flaps of skin stirring weakly on the back of his head.</p>
<p>The store evaporated and the girl was back in Cherry, Nevada. He was trying to leave in the middle of the night. She’d followed him and confronted him. She’d asked the same question over and over as she had held the gun out. ‘Are you going to the Soviets?’</p>
<p>He told her he was hoping to secure armaments for the Wolves, and that with clean clothes and Soviet support they could launch bigger things  —  better things. Ambushes, bombings, even assist the Militias in real rebellion.</p>
<p>He was lying, of course. He was going to the Soviets because the anarchists were all dead, and he would be too if he didn’t run. That was enough for her. She didn’t shoot him for lying. She shot him for desertion.</p>
<p>The memory had ruined her life, and here it was, triggered by one of so many things that reminded her of that time in the desert. When she was back in the supermarket, sweating like a pig, she picked up the can she’d dropped and went back to work.</p>
<p>It was all exaggerated in her head. The boy had covered half the aisle in blood! That wasn’t how the whole thing went down. In the desert she’d shot him from a few feet back, and there had been a red mist but it didn’t touch her. He didn’t splatter none. He went into the ground and bounced off it, kicking as his whole body went haywire, before he went still on the ground. The back of his head spurted once, like a man pissing nervous, and then it bubbled and trickled out of the hole in his head like a drinking fountain as he set to work emptying as many of his litres as he could manage before his organs died. The blood didn’t fucking shine on tiled floors, either. It soaked into the desert. When they moved him, a sweet rose of colour was in the heart of it, red in the sand, but the wide stain was damp and grey and innocent.</p>
<p>She didn’t sleep much that week, goes without saying.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The following concerns Vekllei’s domestic economy, fair warning.</strong></p>
<p>Supermarkets are relatively rare in Vekllei, especially compared to the States. Like many command economies, Vekllei’s internal economy requires total employment. Supermarkets are too automated, and so distribution is usually decentralised among many smaller grocers that can be found on nearly every street. These are what we would consider private enterprises, although Vekllei does not make a distinction between public and private.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Senrouive</em> types of workplaces are distinct from <em>Venrouiva</em> as <em>private</em> or <em>personal</em> business. This is not the same as ‘private’ property, as we understand it. Vekllei does not actually make any distinction of property — everything belongs to the land, including the country. Vekllei does not use money, either. Instead, anything self-operating and nonessential to the operation of the country is <em>Senrouive</em>. Restaurants, cinemas, department stores, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So despite the fact that Vekllei does not use money, grocers benefit from having first pick of goods. There are no real shortages of essential foods in Vekllei, but seasonal and otherwise special produce  —  like that made for festivals or imported from abroad  —  are often in short supply. If you like your food, being a grocer is a good place to start. Occasionally it can also be difficult to obtain special types of ordinary produce — flavoured ham or fruit yogurts, for example.</p>
<p>‘First pick’ is less a gift of the economy to Grocers than it is just a natural conclusion of Vekllei’s moneyless system. Tzipora works at only fourteen, not because she needs spending money or because she wants to climb a food-prep or managerial ladder, but because she’s bored and wearing an apron and badge gives her a small sense of importance, even if she only impresses the handful of regulars that stop by. There is no real value in professionalism in Vekllei, so work hours are very casual and many business close frequently for lunch, afternoon tea, and pre-closing celebration. Most shopkeeps will only give you a passing nod from behind from their paperback when you enter a store.</p>
<p>At first glance, Vekllei’s shelves look like that of any other Western country, but the actual purpose of advertising and posters are pure theatrics  —  they are superficial imitations of an American supermarket with all its colour and splendour  —  the entire purpose of advertising goods it so soak up work-hours of some marketing graduate on his way to bigger and better things. The labels on the cans are just labels.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/policeuniforms.jpg"/> <p>Policing is always difficult in utopian planning. On one hand, utopia is inherently opposed to the idea of policing and the can of worms it brings  —  on the other, people need to feel safe and protected. That’s not something I’ll be talking about today.</p>
<p>The Vekllei Constabulary are the second largest policing body in the country, after conventional police.</p>
<p>Business and manufacturing are divided into two arenas in Vekllei:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Venrouiva</em>: administrative, governmental and national facilities of essential function. Technically, anything under command of the bodies that form national direction (government, legislature, judiciary, etc.) are part of the <em>Venrouiva</em>. This is similar to what we think of nationalised institutions in our countries, but also includes essential industries like electricity and education.</p>
<p><em>Senrouive</em>: is distinct from <em>Venrouiva</em> as private or personal business. This is not the same as ‘private’ property, as we understand it. Vekllei does not actually make any distinction of property  —  everything belongs to the land, including the country. Vekllei does not use money, either. Instead, anything self-operating and nonessential to the operation of the country is <em>Senrouive</em>. Restaurants, cinemas, department stores, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Constabulary are the police force responsible for responding to, patrolling, and protecting <em>Venrouiva</em> business in the country. They are general protection for all seats of power, military assets, power stations, libraries, hospitals, places of worship, national monuments, schools, etc.</p>
<p>Their distinctive uniform is handed down from their years as a rifle-equipped military police. They wear a dark half-cape, white Sam Browne belt, leather gloves and a ceremonial sword from Vekllei&rsquo;s years of monarchy. Women often wear a skirt with a <em>gi</em> quarter-pleat also found in civilian Vekllei clothes and uniforms, as well as a cap. The uniform changes depending on the season and purpose of their duty.</p>
<p>Unlike regular police, which are mostly disarmed in Vekllei, Constabulary always carry pistols, and often submachine guns. While they do not make house calls, you will see them establish checkpoints and escort protests. Keep an eye out for them next time you’re there.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/troops.jpg"/> <p><strong>The single most important function of today’s global powers</strong> is not in the numbers of men at a state&rsquo;s command, or the prosperity of their domestic markets, but the ability to project power across the world entire.</p>
<p>We have seen this manifest in many ways; ICBMs are just one example. Warfare in a modern context has become a highly intelligent and specialised force that has simultaneously limited the brutality of warmongering while amplifying the ruthlessness and political function of state-sponsored murder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Vekllei, there is no real distinction between the intelligence services and the military, although the latter is almost always subservient to the former. Just as agents are armed as terrorists, soldiers are equipped as spies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This all-female sniper company is world-renowned, thanks to the film <em>Beyond These Shores</em>. Like agents of espionage, every woman of this company will spend her entire military age in the cauldron of war, in a cycle of training and international operations that keep their bayonets sharp. They are not coloured by romanticism — on one hand, they can function as a noble skilled partisan in defense of the Vekllei home country. On the other, they are also employed with the secret services to commit acts of terrorism and fratricide. They wear tattered red armbands in camaraderie with their ancestors before them. In parade dress they wear a peaked cap or slouch hat, depending on the festival month.</p>
<p>Almost all of what they do is secret, as much of Vekllei’s military-industrial underbelly is, and no one person directs the employment of these types of people. You can, however, find traces easily enough, even if the women themselves remain unnamed —  last week, in war-torn Burundi, a public hanging was interrupted by mass gunfire and casualty. This destabilising effect on another impoverished sub-Saharan country is trademark Vekllei foreign policy  —  as is the remarkable accuracy of the shots heaped into the executioners.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/blood.jpg"/> <p><strong>Blood is everything to these women.</strong> It defines them through every stage of life  —  bloody emerging from the womb, bloody again in the delicate transition from child to womanhood, and bloody on the table, awaiting cremation in wait of the afterlife.</p>
<p>Even in her name  —  Zelda lo Ula Desmoines  —  the premise of blood is there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zelda, blood of Ula, daughter of the Desmoines family…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet her fundamental human ritual has broken down. It is corrupted —  as a Gregori Baby, she will never reach menarche and have a period, nor will she ever end up on the mortician’s table. And the promises these things bring  —  of family, of love, of fucking, of heritage, of mourning  —  so too are they stolen from her. So if in her native culture her blood defines her, then what definition does she have? Her womanhood is rotted, it is sick, and she is incomplete.</p>
<p>Part of her wonders if the spirits can sense it, too. They seem to flock to her, like demons, as though they can sense she only has one foot in the corporeal world. Is there a reason why blood demons ignore her? And why, on entrance to the spirit world, did the spirits filled her lungs with blood? Maybe these things are just coincidences, but nonetheless…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be thankful of your blood. Be proud of your bloodline, and when you bleed, acknowledge that what drips from you is everything you are. Some girls, like Zelda here, have to remind themselves that they are human to make it through the day.</p>

<p><strong>She met herself out by the shrine, many summers ago</strong>. At first she didn’t know what it was  —  she thought it might be a spirit, or  —  and she caught herself in the thought, because she was only half a child  —  a little part of her wondered if it was a manifestation of God, or Christ, come to help solve her problems. The idea was ridiculous. She believed it was just a forest spirit, and this was probably its shrine.</p>
<p>The copy emerged out of the bushes, and she stared at herself. It moved like she did; clumsy and ungraceful. She apologised for disturbing it, and presented her food offering.</p>
<p>As she watched it approach, a knot caught in her stomach. The thing was looking right at her. The food was ignored. She recoiled and frowned at it.</p>
<p>‘What are you?’ she asked, or something to that effect. ‘An angel? I’m not dying. Are you a psychopomp? I’m not gonna kill myself, so you don’t need to be here.’</p>
<p>It kept on walking over, and she noticed the skin of the copy had faded like an old photograph.</p>
<p>‘Did you hear me? I don’t need your help.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such was her first and only direct encounter with a <em>ganger</em>, an old form of demon that has been driven out long ago from here through industry and agriculture.</p>
<p>They come from the place spirits go to die, and so they carry diseases and misfortune their shoulders. When they take the form of folk out here, they act as an ‘idol’, in a sense, to worship the self  —  they feed off the bad thoughts of wanderers, take control of good memories, and manifest them physically to feed.</p>
<p>In seeing a copy of themselves, many people mistake it for a vision, or a spiritual epiphany. They will destroy themselves if they accept it. Tzipora is not such a fool  —  and she’s out here to leave those good memories far behind her, where they belong. She swings, drawing blood punching at herself, and the apparition disappears. The morning after, she wakes up with blood soaked through her pillow, and a nasty nosebleed.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/oldmap.jpg"/> <p><strong>There is no real distinction between the city of Vekllei and the state of Vekllei</strong>, at least internally. To them, the country and the city are the same, and the isolated population centres of Montre and Adouisneh are simply distant neighbourhoods. This is reflected in all manners of life — they are ethnically and culturally homogenous, patriotic, and largely uncompetitive. They are a single people numbering 20 million, living in the shadow of igneous monument and lush, fertile lands.</p>
<p>In the south, where warm winds from the Azores sweep across the beaches of black sand, the climate is temperate and a great many of Vekllei’s most renowned wonders are accessible. Geysers, the tectonic fault, volcanoes and hot springs are scattered across the outskirts of Vekllei.</p>
<p>Heading north, the cold weather thins large-leaf forests and it is here that her signature landscape is found in abundance — the <em>ro</em>, or flower-tundra, can be hundreds of kilometres wide and populated entirely by flowers, ringed by sharp mountains forced into peaks by the violent forces of the earth below. Vekllei has the most flowers per capita out of any country in the world.</p>
<p>On this map, which is cartoonish and exaggerated, you can see several landmarks — Vekllei’s largest volcano (<em>Durtoneis</em>, or Fire of the Earth), the expansive lava fields to the North, and Vekllei’s food basket, which runs between the ro highlands and the fault line. Only Vekllei’s massive glaciers, which give the country the cleanest drinking water in the world, are in permafrost.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look at this —! Look at this place, where the horizon meets the sky without a stitch! Listen to the water, rich and sweet with soil, trickle through the ro. What a place this is… If she’d had any respect for God, she would have marvelled at the beauty of His ro. If she’d thought He was good and decent, she would have thanked Him for constructing such a place for her. But the truth of it, at least in her mind, was that God may be the creator, but the beauty of this ro is in the hands of humans, now. This place is the territory of Vekllei, in all her glory. If God should ever like to visit — and Tzipora very much hoped he would, because she had some things on her mind — he could apply for a visa at the bureau.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vekllei people are generally unconcerned with the outside world. Their flag, the Red Standard, is a simple blank colour that means &ldquo;Vekllei&rdquo; in Vekllei Semaphore, a sublanguage of <em>potenne</em>, or physical Vekllei language. They also employ an International Standard in foreign arenas, including the U.N. and the Olympics.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/princessoftheearth.jpg"/> <p>They never actually believed that she was any kind of princess. They never even joked about it. The original LIFE magazine article said that she <em>looked</em> as though she were ‘a princess of the Earth’ when interviewer Alfie Ricci met her in the Vekllei highlands, and so she carried that name as a burden for the next few hundred years.</p>
<p>There are many Gregori children alive today, and we have seen the miracle of the first few dozen start to wear off. Gregori Hordiyenko, the little Ukrainian boy whose namesake was adopted by his disease, died age 27 in a car accident. Many others of the &ldquo;first dozen&rdquo; committed suicide, were killed by disease, died from complications arising from the genetic function of the syndrome, and a disproportionate number were born into the third world, where they were eliminated by famine, displacement or superstition.</p>
<p>Tzipora Desmoines, Vekllei’s first and only Gregori baby, was born in 2063. By the time of her LIFE interview, she was sixty-two years old. Yet she remains as she was on the eve of her menarche  —  fourteen, prepubescent, and largely miserable.</p>
<p>When you meet her for the first time, you have no idea how to talk to her. Is she a young teen-ager, or a sixty year old woman? A lot of her patient and soft-spoken quality is misinterpreted as a product of age, but nothing could be further from the truth  —  which is that Tzipora is largely the same girl as she was in 2077, but the spirit and vigour of her teen-age years and childhood curiosity have been stretched unnaturally over decades, blunting her passion and enthusiasm in all things. To the handful of people left alive that she loves, she can be as childish as ever, but the ghosts that dominate her regrets and favourite memories are starting to overcome her.</p>
<p>She is a rare case, despite thousands of boys and girls now like her across the world. She was born in a brief period where Gregori babies were born fairly healthy and independent, save for their obvious genetic malfunction. Today, among the hundreds that are born each year, nearly all of them suffer from broad anaphylaxis that renders them fragile and useless. In theory, all Gregori children will live forever save a car or the rope doesn’t get them, but as the children born with the syndrome become more and more sick very few that are born today will live beyond a normal human lifespan.</p>
<p>As for Tzipora  —  in seventy years she will become the oldest human ever, living or dead.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/fields.jpg"/> <p><strong>Two years ago, a fission military jet plunged into the mountain behind the village of Montre-Lola, emerging moments later as a plume of fire and smoke in the shadow of the mountain peak</strong>. Villagers made their way up the slopes to help survivors, dressed in radiation suits from the town shelter. There were none. Six more lives and six more soldiers lost  —  a pilot, co-pilot, navigator, reactor engineer, bombardier, and fire control officer are written down and then buried like cattle.</p>
<p>Such is the senseless cost of monthly drills, in which the well-oiled spring that sets Vekllei’s nuclear-capable arsenal upon the world quivers in anticipation. The low-lying Raya Valley Air Base fleet emerges over the snow-capped mountains twice a year, panicking farmers below them, as they make their way to auxiliary coastal bases for training.</p>
<p>This year, in usual preparation for the Festival of the Atom, the airship <em>Dumoustra</em> joins a fleet of jet bombers as they rendezvous with the 3rd and 5th Escort squadrons from the coast. They soar dramatically over the ribs of the North Vekllei tectonic mountain ranges, briefly roaring over the quiet farming valleys one by one as peaks pass below them.</p>
<p>The belly of the valleys have some of the best soils in the world, a gift from one of hundreds of volcanoes that are scattered across the North Atlantic nation. Mostly wheat and rice are grown. The sides of the valleys veer dramatically into near-cliffs, folded like paper by the enormous anger of the European and American continental plates.</p>
<p>Trees are short and small-leaved, and often have great colour. Flower-tundras are also common here, called <em>ro</em> in Vekllei.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She was in the shadow of a titan mountain range that followed the tracks as far as she could see. It sloped sharply into the valley, breaking out briefly into a thick temperate woodland before the trees withdrew and terraced wheat fields stepped down to the tracks. Vekllei is an ancient, volcanic land of igneous monument and sharp rock, softened by healthy topsoil bursting with mosses and flowers. She wiped her nose on the back of her hand, and rubbed her eyes. She had dressed up for him but she felt childish shivering on the bare station platform, if it could even qualify as such a thing. It was a bare concrete slab, forty metres long, that serviced rickety rural train cars that ran from here to the Montre terminus, where bullet-train maglevs shot to the capital on the hour.</p>
<p>She looked before her, bringing her knees to her breast, and there was the ro, in all its untouched splendour and colour. The soil here was percolated with water, and it squelched underfoot, rich with minerals and pebbles of quartz and obsidian. As far as she could see, off to her west where the sun was slowly setting, the ground was bejeweled with thick flowers, pockmarked by still pools of fresh water, that, like mirrors, reflected any image above it perfectly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me know if you want to know anything else about Vekllei or this picture.</p>

	  <![CDATA[Just as Iceland&rsquo;s initial history was reshaped into the image of Vekllei some centuries ago, so too has the real-world climate and weather been altered. Cool Icelandic summers have been usurped by volatile days that can be as low as 5C (40F) or as hot as 30C (85F+). Technically speaking, the unstable Atlantic pressure oscillation, of which Vekllei anchors as the Vekllei low pole, can pull in bitter cold from the Greenland currents, or warmth from the Azores tempestuously.]]>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/blacksand.jpg"/> <p>Just as Iceland&rsquo;s initial history was reshaped into the image of Vekllei some centuries ago, so too has the real-world climate and weather been altered. Cool Icelandic summers have been usurped by volatile days that can be as low as 5C (40F) or as hot as 30C (85F+). Technically speaking, the unstable Atlantic pressure oscillation, of which Vekllei anchors as the Vekllei low pole, can pull in bitter cold from the Greenland currents, or warmth from the Azores tempestuously.</p>
<p>So it is that in summer, on a beach of black igneous sand from the volcanoes of this place, hot rains can descend instantly and beat pedestrians until the rains vanish, minutes later. Winters are equally unstable  —  they shift between unlivable cold and sporadic thawing periods.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This unusual climate is not unique to Vekllei. Europe is fucked, meteorologically speaking, by a series of el nino summers and instant winters that wrack Germany, Austria, Italy, and so forth. The Adriatic seems to see more gloom than mediterranean sun these days.</p>
<p>The equatorial deserts of the world, Nevada included, are mere degrees away from unsurvivable. With temperatures frequently breaking 50C (125F) throughout the year, it thins the population of Southerners too old or too poor to avoid the heat.</p>
<p>North Africa is a husk. There is no water and no food. There is a reason there are mass graves all across the shores of the Black Sea, and why Europe tastes the boot. There is a reason the southern African states are crumbling.</p>
<p>East Asia is hot and wet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So these girls march on in the summer rain-storms, not quite conscious of the ridiculousness of enjoying one of the world’s more temperate climates in a country they once called Iceland.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/navyship.jpg"/> <p><strong>There are not many warships in the world today that are distinctive as the serpentine-funnelled, semi-tumblehome hull of the</strong> <strong>Sundress-class supercruisers</strong>. For a country that prides itself on ‘petticoat society’, it is only suitable that Vekllei continues to pioneer the ‘dazzle’ warpaint in her navy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most recent stock of Navy ships are all named after women’s clothes, to emphasise Vekllei’s spiritual understanding of gender in industrial society and also as a sarcastic nominer. What American or Chinese sailor wants to be defeated in naval combat by a supercruiser named after a sundress? There is humour about it. You do not see that in many chambers of navy high command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two 10 inch naval cannons sit on the bow, and use large magazines that give a maximum fire rate of thirty shots a minute. A spiritual successor to the battleships of yore, supercruisers (a light battlecruiser designed for speed and use in shallow water),  are designed for naval gunfire support using these cannons. The ship is also armed with anti-submarine and anti-fighter capabilities as needed. With prolonged shooting the ship is soon absorbed into a cloud of smoke and gunpowder.</p>
<p>The distinctive serpentine auxiliary funnel betrays the <em>Sundress</em>’s nuclear secret  —  an analog diesel engine sits alongside the standard light salt reactor, to immediately take over should the advanced electrics of the ship be disrupted by the electromagnetic effects of a nuclear blast. Because of recent advances in thermal detection, both water vapour from the reactor and smoke from the diesel engine are cooled with seawater in segregated loops, hence the two funnels for two engines.</p>
<p>The navy forms a large part of the island nation’s military consciousness, and so ships are painted unconventionally as part of Vekllei Semaphore (a language within Vekllei of flags, colour and paints) for presentation in military parades. <em>The Festival of the Sea</em>, spanning two weeks in October, concludes with a detonation of a nuclear device offshore.</p>
<p>The sweeping curves of the armoured hull and bridge are common in all the world’s navies these days, as the futurism of yesterday creeps closer to today.</p>

Hello all,
The question on the mind of folks around the world is that of Gregori Children. What are they? What does it mean, to be a “Gregori Baby”?

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/floating.jpg"/> <p><em>Did you know  —  many Gregori children do not form calluses on their skin, because of the intensity of their epidermic regeneration process!</em></p>
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>The question on the mind of folks around the world is that of Gregori Children. What are they? What does it <em>mean</em>, to be a “Gregori Baby”?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gregori Regenerative Syndrome is a developmental phenomenon that afflicts children and young teen-agers. It holds them in a prepubescent state, and so they do not grow old like you and I.</p>
<p>Of the thousands of Gregori children now living in our world today, over 90 per cent of them are girls. They develop normally until an unknown point between thelarche (the beginning of puberty and the development of breasts) and menarche (a girl’s first period). In boys, this timeline is technically different but chronologically similar  —  and always before sexual maturation. Girls in Vekllei might expect menarche as late as fourteen-sixteen (a fact that continues to emphasise the myth of Vekllei virgin purity), whereas boys will likely cease development a few years earlier, usually twelve-fourteen.</p>
<p>Gregori girls can often take the appearance of young teen-agers; they may develop breasts and grow body hair, although these phenomena are not universal among the afflicted. Nonetheless, they have not actually entered puberty proper  —  estrogen is not shaping their bodies, and they will remain sterile for the rest of their lives. Boys are similar, although are usually shorter and more childlike in appearance at the onset of the Gregori process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>So what does being Gregori actually mean</em>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It means the natural biological development of these children and teen-agers has ceased and their bodies have entered an unnatural cellular cycle, which halts the ageing process and renders them immortal, at least in theory. Technically, they are still growing  —  nonregenerative tissue and organs are still growing, like the brain  —  but they are captured in this state forever. Doctors put the blame on a faulty genetic regenerative process, hidden somewhere in their DNA, but the exact cause is unknown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Do they have superpowers?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing of the sort, unfortunately! Existential questions aside, the syndrome can be as much a burden as a miracle. For example, although all Gregori children are immune to cancers and similar cellular malfunction, around 80 per cent of them suffer broad anaphylaxis, meaning that almost all foreign matter triggers an overzealous autoimmune response. This can be fatal, and the ratio of children born with Gregori anaphylaxis has only risen in recent years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Are there any dangers to being Gregori?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gregori teen-agers and children have a high turnover of cells, and some bones do not properly fuse. This renders many of the afflicted delicate and fragile  —  especially children halted at a younger age. The condition is not known to affect emotional or psychological traits of the afflicted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The future implications of Gregori syndrome are limitless  —  ignoring the secret of immortality, the ability to regenerate vital brain, spinal, and optical tissues would revolutionise medicine. Today, there are many thousands of Gregori children in the world, and so the question of their own future remains  —  <strong>are they a genetic abnormality, or the next wave of human evolution?</strong></p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/apartmentliving.jpg"/> <p><strong>Vekllei is the final stop in the epoch of rest</strong>. Departing your jetliner or aeroship and setting foot in the city is a spiritual experience  —  the weight of the world leaves your shoulders, and, at last, you are at peace. Imagine what that would be like  —  <em>to be self-actualised</em>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I die, it will be in Vekllei. The food is good, the women are beautiful — yes, when I go I’ll make sure I’m there, pissed beyond belief, surrounded by my family, watching the city lights wink out for the final time. Isn’t that a hell of an idea? I think it’s a hell of an idea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This street, in a suburb in Montre, is decorated for the moon festival. Sunlight only reaches this place for an hour a day, this time of year. What better time to reconnect with the sprites and your ancestors? For a few dozen precious minutes each day, curtains are flung open, children stream into the street, and office folk take a smoke break. Sure enough, the sun soon sets and the people return indoors, the streets of their city coloured by lanterns. The water of the canals is warm and smells of sulphur. The trams hum with electricity. A wind from the yawning Atlantic batters the sides of the apartment blocks that fill the city. Such is winter life in Vekllei.</p>
<p>They do not use money, and they have not discovered ‘landscape’ as we understand it, but they are fiercely proud of Vekllei and the fruit of her city. Go on, see a flick, or pick out a dress —  better yet, see the city, drink well, fuck often, and fall in love with a Montre chickette.</p>
<p>Underneath this feverish utopian vision lies artifacts of something darker  —  shadows of fear hidden in plain sight. Curtains drawn across apartment windows are laced with lead. A blast would otherwise shatter these glass walls and eviscerate the families inside. The more time you spend in Vekllei, the more you will notice the fear of these people woven into the fibre of the city. Why does every student wear armbands with their school and year embroidered on them? Why are the rainwater gutters beside roads so deep and wide? Tourists visiting airbases will understand the precipice over which the country rocks  —  nuclear jet fighters are cycling their engines always, superelectric trams can detach from the power grid, and sirens perform tests on random days in October.</p>
<p>What is to become of my old girl, the city?</p>

	  <![CDATA[Each person in Vekllei has three names — a given name (Tzipora), a surname (Desmoines), and an alternative given name as part of rapotenne (potenne is ‘handtalk’, upotenne is ‘spirit-talk’, and so it follows that rapotenne is the language system of names). This alternative name is a ‘key’ to the full blood name of an individual, which are given in secret by the mother traditionally, but can be gifted by any mother-figure.]]>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/bloodname.jpg"/> <p>Each person in Vekllei has three names  —  a <strong>given name</strong> (Tzipora), a <strong>surname</strong> (Desmoines), and an alternative given name as part of <em>rapotenne</em> (potenne is ‘handtalk’, upotenne is ‘spirit-talk’, and so it follows that rapotenne is the language system of names). This alternative name is a ‘key’ to the full blood name of an individual, which are given in secret by the mother traditionally, but can be gifted by any mother-figure.</p>
<p>For all intents and purposes, ‘<strong>Tzipora Desmoines</strong>’ works exactly as ‘John Smith’  —  a distinguishing name and the ancestral name. In Vekllei, the men take the name of the child-bearer.</p>
<p>Tzipora’s blood name, her <em>rapotenne</em>, instead reads as: <strong>Zelda lo Ula Desmoines</strong>. This is a name she should never reveal until her death, so rites can be performed.</p>
<p>Although Vekllei’s monarchy is long dead, ancestors are still held sacred by these people. They hold ancient family names that tie their blood to the earth. They are also used when talking with spirits, as they are part of <em>upotenne</em>, the external language of the soul. In this sense, blood names operate as a sacred vocal rune.</p>
<p>Pictured above is Tzipora receiving her blood name from a father-figure many years ago. Since she has no bloodline left alive, he fulfills the role of a father and gives her a name constructed of several parts, researched and tailored to her.</p>
<ol>
<li>Zelda is a nickname and a moniker Tzipora has used to hide her Jewishness, and so works perfectly as a public ‘key’ to her blood name.</li>
<li>lo Ula (her blood of Ula in upotenne) is her ancient, sacred title. The name-giver has not been able to trace her blood to the times of spirits, so he’s traced it as far back as he could and scoured that region for a proper title. Ula is a combination of two words  —  Ura, a type of bare, wind-swept coastal shelf in Northern Vekllei, where Tzipora’s bloodlines originate, and the Vekllei word for iceberg. It also links to an ancient Vekllei saga  —  in which a proud and mighty iceberg is reduced to ice-pebbles after being dashed against the northern rocks. A story of mortality, it is a warning for Tzipora, who does not age.</li>
<li>Desmoines is the family name, unchanged for centuries, and is fairly common in Vekllei.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m really enjoying exploring more of Vekllei’s traditions. Let me know if you have any questions, about these language systems, Tzipora, or anything.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/religiousuniform.jpg"/> <p><strong>In Vekllei animism</strong>, which branches into a vast and complex set of beliefs and traditions that vary from village to village, there is no formal religious structure. Temples and shrines pay respect to <strong>sprites</strong>, which are universally understood as bi-planar creatures. There is no formal religious structure, and so animistic tradition has no priests.</p>
<p>Ceremonial dress is simple to describe, but complex to assemble. The shape and form of the dress, including <em>cascade peplums</em> (a series of peplums that hang over the skirt of the dress) and sun petticoats are traditional, but they hold no religious value outside of the connection to your ancestors who performed the same rites before you. Tradition is very important in Vekllei.</p>
<p>Sprites, and to a lesser extent <strong>spirits</strong>, are fiercely attracted to supernatural colour and shine (polished gemstones, plastics, metals, etc). Pure and natural metals are most alluring to the sprites, as they hold the lustre of the Earth (as well as exude undetectable submagnetic fields called <em>ecec</em>) but they can be substituted with synthetic gold and bronze, as can gemstones, all of which are mass-produced in the industrial city centres of Vekllei.</p>
<p>To meet a sprite, and offer it food, you should dress in these materials. Often villages will collectively maintain traditional outfits for talking to sprites, some of which are hundreds of years old and require care to put on. Sprites can see like you and me, so covering yourself in gold won’t simply do the trick  —  you should dress neatly and politely. It is not necessary to purge yourself of all modern things  —  wristwatches, shoes, hairpieces are all fine, as long as you’ve taken care in your appearance.</p>
<p>Appease a <strong>sprite</strong>, and you might notice lost items turning up, and cracked roof tiles begin to sparkle like new. To befriend a <strong>spirit</strong> is to have plenty to harvest that season, as well as protection from heavy rains.</p>
<p><strong>Tzipora Zelda Desmoines</strong>, miracle girl of the village of <strong>Montre-Lola</strong>, holds a pose in <em>upotenne</em>: the physical language of spirits. As <em>potenne</em> supplements language in Vekllei with sign gestures, <em>upotenne</em> turns your body into an ancient rune, and protects the site from disturbing fields that might scare a sprite. It’s not necessary to hold it for long  —  just acknowledge it. This one performed by Tzipora predates Vekllei language and script  —  no one today can speak it. It lives on today only in physical form, and in that moment time collapses and she is in this place with her ancestors.</p>
<p><em>Just a quick sketch. Let me know if you have any questions</em>.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/policecar.jpg"/> <p><strong>Hopefully you won’t have to worry about the police while you’re in Vekllei</strong>, but you’ll likely notice them. Police are everywhere  —  as an alternative to military (<em>duoroten</em>) service, conscripts can elect to enter domestic security <em>(inrote</em>n). Most officers are young, bored, and live in the community they police. You’ll likely be talking to them at some point in your visit, even if it’s only to ask for directions  —  in Vekllei, cops are the bulletin boards of the community.</p>
<p>All beat cops are unarmed, and carry extendable truncheons that swing from their belt. Much more rarely, you’ll see professional officers  —  you’ll notice them, because they ride in cars. Professional officers travel in pairs, and the senior officer is known as a <em>firearm officer</em>, and will carry a sidearm.</p>
<p>Should you be detained by police, keep the following in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Vekllei is a casual culture.</strong> Some officers will speak English, but the concept of ‘sir’ has never entered their vocabulary. They will approach and interact with you casually  —  professionalism operates differently here. Nor will they bow to you, except in stations. If you act hysterical, they will cease to take you seriously. Keep your cool, be friendly, talk clearly.</li>
<li><strong>Vekllei is a physical culture</strong>. Police will touch, pull, and push you without communicating. This is not an intimate or aggressive gesture  —  they will just as soon pull you out of the thoroughfare of a sidewalk as restrain you.</li>
<li><strong>Vekllei police do not heavily employ firearms, but are liberal with the baton</strong>. Only when responding to a firearm call will police approach with a firearm in hand. Otherwise, they will rest a baton on their shoulder and are trained to use it against you, should you attempt to fight them. In a country without currency, there is no such thing as ‘damages’. Public drunkenness is not tolerated in Vekllei and is not an excuse for fighting with police.</li>
</ol>
<p>With all that said, Vekllei has an extremely low crime rate and it is very unlikely you’ll ever see cops responding to a crime. More often you’ll see them escorting other emergency service vehicles through pedestrian streets, arguing with locals and doing odd jobs around the community. Especially in rural communities, there is very little distinction between on and off-duty cops, and beat cops will often wear their uniform around town while unassigned to a shift.</p>
<p>In the picture above we see professional cops, or <em>copa</em>, watching a suspect from across the street. We can tell they are professional officers because they wear red and white uniforms, instead of the navy, red and white of beat cops. The woman is a firearm officer, and carries a revolver in her holster. The man is not armed but carries a baton on his shoulder.</p>
<p>The police car, a <em>Model 10 (Special)</em>, sits low to the ground, weighed with a 60MWe Molten Salt Reactor where we’d usually find the trunk. The car has a theoretical top speed of 400km/h, but will never reach anywhere close to that  —  pursuits are extremely rare in the country, as almost no-one has a personal automobile. On its roof it carries two cherry lights and a single <em>Dura</em> wailer siren. The service number, 6, tells us that the unit is from the Montre region.</p>
<p>As for the suspect? A small domestic fight between a grocer and his daughter fizzled out and they both apologised to the officers and community for wasting their time.</p>

	  <![CDATA[Vekllei has a pan-pacific flavour of greeting, usually a bow followed by a handshake. If you’re going to fit in, you’re going to have to learn how to do it right. Let’s get started.
First, Vekllei is extremely physical in its language. Not expressive, like how you might picture an Italian or American. Instead, it incorporates an auxiliary language called potenne or, ‘Hand-Talk’, which accompanies words. A forefinger sliding across a forefinger is ‘good’ or, ‘acknowledged’, and can be used with verbalising the word or as a signal.]]>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/bowing.jpg"/> <p><strong>Vekllei has a pan-pacific flavour of greeting, usually a bow followed by a handshake.</strong> If you’re going to fit in, you’re going to have to learn how to do it right. Let’s get started.</p>
<p>First, Vekllei is extremely physical in its language. Not expressive, like how you might picture an Italian or American. Instead, it incorporates an auxiliary language called <em>potenne</em> or, ‘Hand-Talk’, which accompanies words. A forefinger sliding across a forefinger is ‘good’ or, ‘acknowledged’, and can be used with verbalising the word or as a signal.</p>
<p>Similarly, bowing takes on elements of potenne. There are hundreds of ways to bow, but there are a few basic rules that will make your time in Vekllei easier.</p>
<ol>
<li>The angle of the bow determines the seriousness of the gesture. A ninety-degree bow is most-serious, used for meeting foreigners of importance, apologising profusely, or welcoming a prestigious guest. In modern Vekllei, where mateship has displaced traditional hierarchy, it is rarely used except in service of others. Most common is fifteen degrees, with a maximum of forty-five in polite, formal conversation.</li>
<li>You must not speak while bowing. The act is a word in itself and it is loud and obnoxious to speak and act. Welcome, or apologise, or thank the partner. Then bow.</li>
<li>Formal bowing, as employed in serious or dire times as a collective action, is taken on the knees on the floor. The head is pressed against the ground. Those unable to kneel can lower their heads. The most obvious example of this for the reader is in the ten-minutes mourning following the <em>Lola</em> nuclear attack, when every able-bodied citizen faced the district and bowed in honour of the dead.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s observe <strong>Tzipora Zelda Desmoines</strong>, miracle girl of Montre-Lola, in three types of bowing you are most likely to encounter in your travels.</p>
<ol>
<li>With hands interlocked, hanging parallel to the legs, the greeting bow is most common and works as a friendly gesture. Make sure to lock your fingers properly. Only with foreigners will you bow with your arms straight by your sides, so make sure to let the arms dangle perpendicular to your legs.</li>
<li>To apologise, or excuse yourself, place your fingers gently on your neck and bow to the degree it is appropriate. Close your eyes. If the person has more to say, release your hands from the back of your neck, listen, then repeat the gesture.</li>
<li>A welcome bow, employed as a gesture of solidarity, welcomes you into homes and places of business. This is not a ‘hello’, this is a, ‘how may I serve you?’. Forms fists with your hands and place them over your chest. Do not bow your head, and keep eye contact with the partner. It is unusual for foreigners to perform this bow, unless they are employed in some capacity. In Vekllei, this translates more literally to greetings, mate,’ and the service is implied.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind that Vekllei does not use honourifics, and supplements titles with bows. These are important. Use them luxuriously, and have fun! Vekllei people will appreciate the gesture from a foreigner.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/coldweather.jpg"/> <p>Welcome to Vekllei. It is a strange country with a complex culture that is quite distinct (and sometimes outrageous) to Western countries. This will be a long post. I’ve tried to keep it clear.</p>
<hr>
<p>Women in Vekllei usually wear skirts in winter. There are cultural and historical reasons for this, explained below. Pictured here is Tzipora in a winter Vekllei outfit so typical it works well enough here to give a show-and-tell. The outfit consists of underwear (vest, stockings/socks, etc.), an inner lace petticoat, a cotton thermal pettiskirt, and a wool outer skirt. They reach about the mid-shin. She wears a thick cotton shirt over her vest and a rayon cardigan on top, with cotton gloves. Although not pictured here, when heading out a long wool overcoat would protect from the fierce Vekllei wind.</p>
<p>The colours are not wintery, but that requires context. The history of language and gender are not everyone’s cup of tea, but if you want to know more, let’s get started.</p>
<hr>
<p>Winters in Vekllei are long and dark. In the depths of it the sun rises only for about an hour. Temperatures range between 5 and -15 centigrade. By all accounts it is not a place for skirts.</p>
<p>But many women don’t consider thick or multilayered trousers. This is because womanhood is tied very clearly to physical appearance. Vekllei lacks gender pronouns entirely, but has very clear feminine and masculine words. Vekllei written language is logographic, and so you ‘construct’ concepts out of images. So certain gender concepts, like femininity, are constructed out of feminine associations that ‘build’ a sensation and understanding of what it means to be female. Skirts are a part of that. To feel like a woman in Vekllei, there are explicit images that build femininity.</p>
<p><strong>That is not to say Vekllei is necessarily misogynist</strong>, at least as we understand it through a Western lens  —  the political and cultural understanding of the country (usually called ‘petticoat socialism’) strongly suggests that our fundamental ‘human’ traits are inherently female.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It emphasises the overall ‘femininity’ of humanity and shifts the human core to female, and then distinguishes masculine traits as radical and far from the centre of the human condition. Petticoat feminism takes on economic qualities and a radical reading of gender to describe its main point of function and praxis  —  that masculine qualities are inherently economic, and that they will cease to be masculine as petticoat socialism achieves its aim of rendering labour unnecessary for all reasons except self-satisfaction. In petticoat feminism, the final form of the human race is female  —  not in a biological sense, but in a cultural attitude that has essentially ceased to distinguish between masculine and feminine qualities, while retaining what it views as inherently female virtues.</p>
<p>Fragility, grace, beauty, leisure, and reproduction are placed upon the shoulders of men, rendering them ‘female’ in the lexicon of petticoat feminism, and thus relieving them of the economic burden of masculinity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Knowing all that, it still basically means that skirts are for women, and women wear skirts to feel like women. Vekllei clothing has thus become multilayered and insulated to adapt to the shift from summer to winter.</p>
<p><strong>As far as colours go</strong>, Vekllei is volcanic and geographically active. Fire and ice are synonymous here. This means that red and blues are associated with keeping warm and ice, and yellows and greens are for the lush foliage in the warmer seasons. It is uncommon to wear reds in the summer  —  it’s too hot to need colours associated with fire.</p>
<p>This post is long enough, I think. Tzipora is in the wind but looks happy enough. If you have questions about the language itself, or what the annotations say, <em>just ask</em>.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/missiletrain.jpg"/> <p>This is a concept of a Vekllei Rocketry Corp rail ICBM launcher. It has distinctive-looking carriages, and so it serves no real purpose in being a ‘hidden’ ICBM launcher. Instead, this train is for testing rail-mounted ICBMs, which are then employed in plain and unmarked railcars. Today it idles by the lakeside town of Dupot-Monan, as its senior control staff await a hot lunch driven in from the town. All equipment, including the silo, is extended.</p>
<p>It uses two nuclear locomotives, which produce many thousands of times more power than is required to operate the vehicle and launcher. They have radiating fans as a primary air intake. The launch car has an articulating hydraulic arm that raises the silo. Rail-mounted ICBMs launch ‘cold’. They are propelled out of the tube by gases within the silo, and only ignite outside of the train.</p>
<p><strong>In 2127, the Soviets, U.S., China and Vekllei all employ hidden rail-launched ICBMs</strong> as a ‘dead-hand’ that can retaliate after an atomic attack. They rove the countryside of these superpowers, by all appearances regular cargo trains, invisible to spies and spy satellites alike. Rail-mounted ICBMs, and their testing, is one of the more frequently-broken clauses of the latest atomic weapons treaties. It is an unkept secret. This train, ‘Missile Carriage 2,’ is on its way to the rocketry test facility sixty kilometres away. With two nuclear locomotives attached, the trip will take less than fifteen minutes. Well, at least after lunch is finished.</p>
<p><em>Just a quick sketch. Thanks, guys.</em></p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/penance.jpg"/> <p><strong>He had sent her a wire some weeks before asking to meet her</strong>. She did not remember him. By now he was an old man, and she, a Gregori baby of sixty four years, had not aged a day. He was close to dying and wanted to relieve his soul of the war crimes he’d committed as a member of the Vanguard in the Second American Civil War. She had been a little ptitsa back then, fighting with the Milita. He was desperate to repay her, and what she stood for, as in 2127 she is one of the few living Militia women on this Earth.</p>
<p>In this scene we see <strong>Michael Greenfield</strong> washing the feet of <strong>Tzipora Zelda Desmoines</strong> at a spirit shrine in <strong>Vekllei</strong>, in a melding of Christian tradition and Vekllei cultural humility. She is surrounded by her friends, including her estranged Japanese husband on the left (fourteen years old, sixty two years age). She does not like her feet being touched, but it is important to her to see a living artifact of the war that shaped her childhood. She still carries part of the war with her  —  as he fills a basin and she bares one foot, Michael notices she is afflicted with nervous tics. She rubs her nose and picks at her shirt. When she is nervous, like she is now, the tics are almost constant.</p>
<p>These two are survivors of the Second American Civil War, which spanned a decade in the 2070s. They fought on opposite sides  —  Tzipora on the liberal, socialist, anarchist coalition called the Militia, Michael as a fascist for the Vanguard party. Tzipora grew disillusioned with the war and fled after three years of fighting. Michael continued to serve until the Federal Government succeeded in crushing both movements. The crimes he has committed in war weight on him, now late in life. He passed away six months after this strange and awkward meeting.</p>

<p>While she cannot die in this place, she retains full control of her nervous system, a bone of fact that was proved when the pain of having a hole torn through her hit her brain all at once.</p>
<p>Blood spirits, despite their name, actually take all kinds of fluids from spirits and physical creatures alike. They are easily warded off by other spirits, and are incapable of harming them properly. Should a blood spirit escape into the natural world, however, they would wreak havoc in search for food.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, I have answers. This is a pretty mediocre sketch of an idea I had.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/gregorichildren.jpg"/> <p><strong>This post is part discussion, part lore.</strong></p>
<p>Kojin Karatani, on the subject of childhood, writes;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, children have existed since ancient times, yet &rsquo;the child&rsquo; as we conceive of it and objectify it did not exist prior to a particular period [&hellip;].</p>
<p>From this viewpoint, it becomes clear that the grouping of children by age in the compulsory educational system of modern Japan signified the uprooting of children, as abstract and homogenous entities, from productive relations, social classes, and communities that had previously been their concrete contexts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For my own world (the city-state of Vekllei and her alternate future) this idea is is something I’m experimenting with. As people <strong>of a modern world, we may contain within ourselves biases about what ‘childhood’ is.</strong></p>
<p>Karanati’s fundamental point is that, following the Meiji Restoration in Japan, their education system modernised, and took on the Western idea of a ‘child’. Today, the development of children is staggered through very specific age groups  —  they play with kids their own age, they learn with kids their own age, and what we expect of them accompanies, in part, how we’ve structured school.</p>
<p>So in my world, I’ve tried to develop a system in which almost all age groups, or at least large groupings of them, learn inside the same classroom. If 25% of rooms in a school are dedicated general-learning classrooms, what could you do with the rest of the space? Dedicated science/language/athletic centres? Likewise, how would children playing with both older and younger kids influence their social development. And how would work (or employment), either in agrarian or industrial contexts, impact their growth as people?</p>
<p>As for lore:</p>
<p>I’ve tried to sketch a uniform here that is both visually interesting and simple enough to assemble (the girl, in this case, is wearing a less-common, formal variation). In keeping with the ideas above, the uniform would be consistent across all year groups.</p>
<p><strong>Things of note on the girl</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Flowers are a large part of femininity, in particular ‘girlishness’, and elaborate headdresses like the one here are common for picture days and ceremony</li>
<li>She wears a lace apron above her skirt, under the pleat, called a ‘Soitres Deh’ (soo-treh deh), which is ceremonial and very delicate. Some wear it to announce they’ve entered a relationship. Usually not worn to school.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Things of note on the boy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>His cap, while part of the uniform, is more commonly worn in fields and factories as a labourer’s cap, and is emblazoned with the emblem of the enterprise or school. Very common in Vekllei.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what to you think? I’ve given enough detail to stop people reading it, but not enough to properly explore the idea of childhood. What do you think? How do you deal with education in your world?</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/worldsritual.jpg"/> <p><strong>Tzipora is the oldest person alive, now aged 1,056 years.</strong> With the body, temperament, and vitality of an 11-year-old, and the lived experience of a dozen generations, she is a victim Gregori syndrome. She has seen man rise from Earth into space, and although she still calls her birth-country of Vekllei on Earth home, she frequently tours the cosmos as part of complex interplanetary diplomacy. The press calls her the Princess of the Earth.</p>
<p>In 3,119 A.D., she visits the Ra system. She meets the people there, called Roala, who were once descendents of East Asia on Earth. Here she takes part in an ancient ritual in which she bridges herself between the spirit and human worlds.</p>
<hr>
<p>She is dressed in both ordinary Vekllei clothing, which is familiar and Earthly, and Roala ceremonial dress patterned with reflective gems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using her left hand, she guides the angle of power.</li>
<li>Her right hand, raised above her head, is the focus of power and is anchored to the human world by her left foot. If she breaks the angle directed by her left hand, and they become unaligned, she will lose her physical space in both worlds and collapse into nothing.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a few minutes at a time, she is able to see and contact both the human and spirit worlds.</p>
<ul>
<li>As she closes the ritual, the power of the stars wane, and so her heart becomes an auxiliary power source to help close the bridge. As it strains under the pressure of joining two worlds, her heart glows through her shirt.</li>
<li>At this moment, plants die under her feet and she mustn’t be touched, otherwise the bridge will cascade into a wider collapse that can destroy several people.</li>
<li>Finally, her heart settles and Tzipora collapses into the arms of a photographer, dripping with sweat and sapped of all strength.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>It is a great privilege to know how to contact the spirit world. Ordinary Earth people like Tzipora usually have ask for passage from the bones of angels, called Derden. But out here, with the Roala, she partakes in their way of life to cement the bond humanity has across systems.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/anarchist.jpg"/> <p><strong>The young Republican has waited in a queue to have her photo taken in front of the remains of Cherry, Nevada</strong>. Her hair is still short after the fascists shaved her head, and branded her with St David’s star because she had a Jewish name. She would later tell the Republican Militia that she wasn’t, in fact, a Jew. The Militia didn’t care.</p>
<p>So she drapes herself in the anarchist flag and holds an ancient Mosin rifle she’d never fired, and for a moment she is part of something bigger than herself  —  of hope, and anger, and brotherhood. These are the things that fuel the Republican movement, despite its infighting and poor equipment. There are many factions within the Militia  —  the Moscow-backed Marxist-Leninists, anarchists, Trotskyists, and smaller liberal sects. For now, they fight together against the fascists.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Vanguard movement grew in the South after decades of poverty and neglect from the federal government</strong>. Vanguardism was ostensibly about family and Southern nobility, but was always unmistakably fascist at its core, and part of a wider populist movement across the world in 2063. Many Southerners found themselves choosing between enlisting with the socialists, or death. Because for many, that’s what it was. Fascism was death  —  if they didn’t shoot the Jew or the socialist or the negro, they would displace them into oblivion. It was worth picking up a rifle for.</p>
<p>The young girl here, Tzipora, aged eleven, would later be disillusioned by the Republican movement and escape it. She had seen too many terrible things performed on behalf of the Militia, and the anarchists were being sabotaged by Moscow. This was the ultimate product of the civil war  —  bitter, jaded soldiers who had been stripped of their idealism and vitality. Fascist or socialist, everything they had fought for had died in the South.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/radiation.jpg"/> <p><strong>He started collecting radioactive material</strong> from the clocks and electronic appliances in his house earlier in the week. The material, which included radium and americium, was placed in a compartment in the living room wall of his apartment. This exposed his wife, nine-year-old son and infant daughter to dangerous levels of radioactivity. By Wednesday that week the baby had fallen ill, and Mrs Toutan took her to Miuounne General that evening, returning with a prescription for ibuprofen. While his father was at work, and his mother was in the garden, the son rang the police the next day, hallucinating figures attempting to enter through the apartment windows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The infant girl received a dose of 2-3 Gy, swelling soft tissues and burning parts of the skin exposed to the rear living room wall. Her brother, 10, survived, but will almost certainly suffer the effects of ARS for the rest of his life. The danger to Vekllei families is made obvious by the Toutan tragedy  —  household appliances almost universally have little resistance to tampering, and threaten to expose inquisitive children, or as we have seen here, the mentally ill, to dangerous levels of radioactive material.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><strong>Mr Toutan, a veteran of the Sino-Taiwanese war</strong>, was troubled by his experiences and was diagnosed prior to this incident with <em>shellshock</em> and <em>trenchsickness</em>. These ideas did not capture his suffering in entirety  —  he was shattered by his experience in the war, and disabled by chemical weaponry. His paranoia, stemming from what we know as PTSD, eventually deteriorated into mania. He was convinced of a coming nuclear apocalypse, and at some point had the idea that the creation of a private nuclear reactor could keep his family safe underground when the bombs dropped. Although he had neither the training or the intellectual chops for nuclear physics, he began to collect material that would soon poison his family and kill his infant daughter.</p>
<p>Some 75,000 veterans are registered with the various support bureaus in Vekllei. They shuffle between home and work, their faces blank, their souls in Taiwan. By the time Mr Toutan poisoned his family, maybe he was more than ready to go.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/seaside.jpg"/> <p><strong>About this time of year, in the place between high summer and autumn, the weather is good in Vekllei</strong>. Vekllei is too cold for crickets, but insects are out and the air hums with life  —  birds, helijets, and the soft noise an ocean breeze makes as it races toward the harbour, pulling on leaves and skirt hems along the way.</p>
<p>The Lola monorail carries tourists and workers between the district centre and the World Expo Tower. A medihelijet buzzes the top of the hill, circling for a place to land. In the distance a supersonic jet roars off to New York. It’s a great time to be alive.
Anchored far from the harbour is an enormous nuclear aircraft carrier. From the top of the hill you can see jets jump off and return to the deck like bees in the spring. It’s training season and the air force cadets are piloting jump-jets.</p>
<p>The days this time of year are almost twenty hours long  —  the nightlife is endless and exhausting. In winter Vekllei rests, sleepy, until springtime returns in late May.</p>
<p>The view from Lola is smaller than that of the rest of the city  —  the planned city of Vekllei is a few hillsides over, making Lola a wonderful location to raise a family. It feels quiet and small, and the city centre is only ten minutes away by hypertrain.</p>
<p>In this coming late autumn Vekllei will be struck by two nuclear bombs, and although Lola will be spared, the event will radically change life in the sprawling, utopian city of Vekllei.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you have any questions, let me know! You can see more of Vekllei <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/74l1yc/a_little_vekllei_general_store/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/75p2nt/watching_the_end_of_the_world/">here</a>. <em>Thanks for reading.</em></p>

He knew the broad from his days hunting smuggler types in jazz bars and street cars, a gig not worth gigging now that prohibition was over. She was a pretty little chickadee attached to a big guy of bad temper, and he guessed one night he took it too far. The girl swung her frypan into him, and on the way down he hit his head. Hard. Another sob story from the city of silence. He took another drag and breathed out, smoke filling his dingy apartment. The girl was only nineteen.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>With <em>that</em> bullshit out of the way, let’s talk business. Lila Ouilanan, 19, is being led away by two Vekllei cops from the home where she lived with her fiance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Almost all crime in Vekllei, in an absence of currency and any real material value, is domestic. Police here are as much negotiators and therapists as they are detectives. Lila was engaged to her boyfriend, who beat her, when she hit him with a frying pan. He hit his head on a countertop, which killed him. She was later acquitted.</li>
<li>The policewoman is wearing a summer uniform. The winter uniform is similar, but they wear a blouse and can also choose to wear navy wool stockings. Female firearms officers, who are trained with heavy and automatic weapons, wear trousers and boots.</li>
<li>The policeman is wearing an all-season uniform with navy coat. The summer uniform looks similar to the female variant, except with a cap and trousers.</li>
<li>Firearms officers make up one in every four officers, and operate anti terrorist and militia duties. They are not necessarily senior to regular officers, but instead have military training and act as a form of civil defense in the event of an invasion or following a nuclear attack. They are trained to direct civilian partisans and recruit resistance movements, rendering them partially paramilitary.</li>
<li>All officers carry a pistol, usually a revolver, and a variant of truncheon suited to the specific officer. Mobile units, which use vehicles to patrol, carry a heavier tactical weapon, like a shotgun, in the vehicle.</li>
<li>Except in specific units designed for a special purpose, all officers patrol and enforce law in the district they live in. Most officers know most civilians living in an area, and they regularly drop by apartments to meet and communicate with the local population.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Forgive the sketch. If you have any <strong>questions or comments</strong>, I’d love to hear them.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/princessofearth.jpg"/> <p><strong>Barbaloh was once the spirit of a rainforest</strong>, but now lives only in the world of the spirits as a merchant, selling potions, spells and other supernatural nonsense. <strong>Tzipora</strong>, a brave human girl and fierce humanist, has gained passage to the spirit world through the bones of a derden, or “angel”. She found herself in another dimension and in total darkness, and the spirits immediately sensed her presence, taking physical and anthropomorphic forms to talk to her. A blood spirit, speaking as a deformed rodent creature, took interest in the arteries in her forearms. She would have been killed if not for Barbaloh’s customers, who drove the spirit off and demanded she meet with Barbaloh. They tell her that she is the first human to enter the spirit world in forty-five thousand years, and since Barbaloh is the defacto lord of the spirit marketplace, he shall listen to what she has to say.</p>
<p>A frog-like spirit called <strong>Woh</strong> tells her to strip off the filthy school uniform she’d arrived in, and materialises a beautiful gown in front of her. He tells her to wear it, and Tzipora protests, but she begrudgingly undoes the buttons of her shirt and reaches for the gown.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There,” Woh tells her in a voice that isn’t human, “<strong>you are now the Princess of the Earth</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so Tzipora, at least to the spirits, inherited the Earth. Terrified and alone, she became the ambassador of the human race, and to save them she would have to meet Barbaloh.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are obvious elements of spirit culture in the design of the gown. The lanterns suspended from wooden poles give her passage in this place, the left one protecting her body from the spirits and the right one ensuring her blood continues to flow. As a human with a physical form, she is vulnerable to the temperaments of these creatures. Barbaloh asks her to take off her shoes and socks and walk barefoot, to anchor her to the world. Physical beings can become detached from reality down here, forgetting their birth names, forgetting their body and finally starving a state of vegetation. The gown is embedded with crystals of the Earth, sewn out of a material like silk. Circles are a recurring motif, in reference to the Earth.</p>
<p>The story of Tzipora and my retrofuturistic world is a long and occasionally confusing one. It is set in the summer of 2063. If you would like to know more, just ask, or check my post history for everything Vekllei-related. <em>Thanks for listening</em>.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/spies.jpg"/> <p><strong>In Nevada about this time of year, the temperature stays steady at 45 degrees</strong> (~115 in yank). The asphalt sticks to shoes. On the far right is <strong>Lenny the Jew</strong>. The moniker is his own; he’s a Jew from New York who ended up working for the <strong>Vekllei Rocketry Corps</strong>, the Vekllei espionage agency responsible for operations in the southern United States. Lenny the Jew is good with women, and violence. He operates as a “live” agent, hunting and eliminating Chinese and American spies when necessary, bringing radicals over the border to cause trouble, and squeezing persons of interest for information. His boss is sitting next to him. <strong>Michael</strong> operates the Vekllei Rocketry Corps, but rarely participates “live”. His daughter, shipped over from the homeland after the death of her mother, understands the secrecy  —  but not the scope  —  of what he does. Lenny the Jew has affection for <strong>Tzipora</strong>; she’s a strange kid that doesn’t get on well with her peers, so he brings her gifts when he calls by their house.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Vekllei espionage is chaotic</strong>. Very little interest is given towards industrial espionage, unlike the Chinese, who are chasing aerospace and nuclear technology. Vekllei is interested in provoking, destabilising, disrupting, distracting and sabotaging political and economic life in the United States. The Rocketry Corps, despite its name, ferries drugs over the border, commits terrorism and murder, disappears threats, distributes agitprop and pampers people of interest. It is the largest of the localised Vekllei espionage agencies, with little judicial oversight and a nationalistic fervour that makes the Rocketry Corps one of the largest internal threats in the United States today.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/spiritworld.jpg"/> <p><strong>Suddenly the blood drained from her lungs</strong> and she breathed in, only to double over, hacking blood into the grass between her shoes. She wiped her bloody mouth on the back of her arm and mumbled something like ‘sorry’ before coughing again. She slipped off her shoes and made her way to the clearing.</p>
<p>She saw the bones and knelt in front of them, laying some flowers out for it and waiting respectfully. After a few minutes she worked up the nerve to open her mouth, and when she wasn’t attacked, she began to talk to it in a soft little voice. She said she wanted to go to the spirit world, and it did nothing. She said she needed to go there because she’d been having dreams about great monsters rising up and destroying humanity. It didn’t move, and she glanced at the forest spirits that had gathered around her. She clasped her hands together and started to introduce herself to the bones. She was Tzipora, she grew up in the city of Vekllei not far from here, her parents died when she was young and her adoptive mother was struck by a truck and killed last summer. She loves her father and country and doesn’t want it to be destroyed.</p>
<p>As she talked more she found herself saying aloud things she’d never said before. About being a Gregori baby, about feeling separated from the rest of the human race, about the time she went to a festival with a Japanese boy who was gone now. She said she liked to write and hadn’t ever eaten a hotdog but she wanted to, and that once the older girls molested her out the back of the school. She said she liked her hair when it was like this; bouncy and self-regulating. She didn’t know why it wouldn’t stay like this all the time, but she didn’t have a hairbrush, so it was good that it looked good today.</p>
<p>An hour passed and she ran out of things to say and realised her entire life could fit in a conversation on an average bus trip. She unclasped her hands but didn’t dare shift from her kneel. All of a sudden, the grass beneath her disappeared and she plummeted, shoes, flowers and all, into darkness.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The above passage was written with this picture.</strong> This is the moment that Tzipora, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/6xtflc/tzipora_one_of_the_children_to_stop_ageing_vekllei/">Gregori baby</a> enters the spirit world to stop ancient creatures called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/752bfk/the_face_of_human_extinction/">Lehmenan</a> from destroying the world. The Lehmenan are restless after a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/75p2nt/watching_the_end_of_the_world/">nuclear war between China and the United States</a>. Very few people, and all of them children, know that spirits exist. Alone and terrified of losing the world to the Lehmenan, Tzipora goes to the bones of the Lehmenan’s creator, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/752bfk/the_face_of_human_extinction/">now-extinct Derden</a>, and asks it to let her into the spirit world.</p>
<p><em>I understand this is quite a lot to take in. Ask me a question, follow the links for more information on the parts of this world, or check my post history if you want more information.</em> I love questions and comments.</p>
<p>EDIT: Sprinkled a couple more links in and decided to proofread.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/vkdress.jpg"/> <p><strong>Vekllei people are usually buried in their national dress.</strong> It marks the important stages in their way of life; of graduation, of marriage, of ceremony. The carousel of festivals and parades and holidays that these Atlantic people enjoy are all spent in uniform, their national costume, that forms the public face of their country.</p>
<p>Lou and Mey here, two happy young things in love, are dressed up for the National Holiday. It is the biggest event of the year. Mey wears a flower as a hairpiece and a red pinafore in the national colours. Under her <strong>Lawhsk Ehma</strong>, which is equivalent to a “Maiden’s Apron” in English, she has a wide lace half-petticoat called a <strong>Doeh</strong>. The Doeh is unique to each girl, and is designed for them at menarche, or her first period. The little lace patterns have special meaning that inscribe parts of her personality, her background and her work. They are always buried with the girl, either worn or folded and pocketed. In Vekllei they wear red sandals and white socks or stockings to match the flag.</p>
<p>They both wear the Eliese flower, and usually another pin that marks their heritage  —  the son of a shipbuilder will wear the maritime cross. Both Lou and Mey here wear the Industry Roundel Star. His father is a dyehouse foreman and her mother works as a machinist in a robot factory. Lou wears a half-cape, barely visible here, that is called a <strong>Toutahn</strong> and is usually handed down, as opposed to the Doeh. The white cap is both part of the national dress and ceremonial dress in the armed forces. Lou smokes, which is uncommon but not unheard of for sixteen-year-olds.</p>
<p>On the National Holiday, which lasts a week, all of Vekllei is put on display. Aircraft carriers dock for visitors, the parliament dissolves for a week and is opens its doors to the public, and a thumping nightlife begins to introduce teenagers like Lou and Mey here to the finer things of life.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/apocolypse.jpg"/> <p><strong>The sight of the missiles nearly made her sick.</strong> Everything around her took on new context. It was such a peaceful afternoon, and the sirens hadn’t gone off, and here she was, watching the trails the missiles painted in the cloudless sky. And now she was blessed with a newfound psychic ability that told her that everything in this spot would be vapour in a half hour. The wheat, the forest, the road; everything. Anyone who wasn’t looking at the sky didn’t know it yet. To folks indoors or out of view of the vapour trails, it was still a beautiful spring. It took a half hour for Vekllei missiles to reach China. Theirs took about the same to get here.</p>
<p>The sirens didn’t go off until five minutes after the missiles launched. You could tell they were civil defense sirens because they built up to a whine and stayed there, a sound they’d all heard in drills, but it wasn’t drill season. Tzipora scrambled down the side of the ditch and took her bike with her, and sat cross-legged in the brook with her hands over her eyes. If everything became bright she’d hold her breath and lie face down until she was either dead or the sonic boom flung her downstream.</p>
<p>On May 6th 2064 the mid-Atlantic country of <strong>Vekllei</strong>, <strong>China</strong>, and the <strong>United States</strong> participated in a confused nuclear war that nearly annihilated North America and East Asia. In Vekllei, two bombs hit, and the rest of the Chinese delivery aircraft was downed by the air force. The two small-yield ground-burst weapons killed only 20,000. Many millions were saved by the comprehensive civil defense of the country. The United States lost forty million people. China is unknown, but is likely in the hundreds of millions after the full retaliatory strike from two separate countries.</p>
<p>The war had wider consequences, as it awakened ancient creatures underground that were built to protect the Earth. The creatures, called <strong>Lehmenan</strong> in a dead tongue, would in the weeks following the war attempt to wipe the surface of the world clean of human society.</p>
<p>You can read about Tzipora <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/6xtflc/tzipora_one_of_the_children_to_stop_ageing_vekllei/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/7249z5/tzipora_the_undying_miracle_child_vekllei/">here</a>.

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/face.jpg"/> <p>All servants of heaven  —  called angels by most people but they belong to a much older name  —  are viciously jealous of human beings. In creation, the Earth was promised to them, but the creator God gave the Earth to the human race. In a fit of rage, the angels  —  or <strong>Derden</strong>, as they were called before the current chapter of humanity  —  buried bioengineered monsters called <strong>Lehmenan</strong> far below the surface of the Earth. If humanity ever became reckless and destroyed themselves, they would awaken and wipe the Earth clean with great lances of fire.</p>
<p>In 2063, <strong>Red China</strong> suffered a military coup d&rsquo;etat, and the ensuing Sino-American nuclear exchange consumed both countries in a great fire that destroyed vast swaths of forest and the creatures and spirits within them. The Lehmenan began to wake.</p>
<p>Tzipora, an unremarkable girl in the small mid-Atlantic country of <strong>Vekllei</strong>, stands in front of the bones of an Angel, or Derden, and begs it to let her into the spirit world to stop the Lehmenan. The Derden hates human beings, and it fills her lungs with blood to try and scare her away. She stands steady.</p>
<p>It was in this moment, in the shadow of fallout in a wind-swept field of rural Vekllei, that a child dressed in the uniform she wore to school became an ambassador for the entire human race. Not before or since has such a remarkable image of humanism in the face of God existed.</p>

Not in Lola. If you’re in Lola, you’re there to see the good stuff, produced and sold in little shops like this one. The apartments of this place are small and cramped, and the streets are rarely wide enough for vehicles to pass, but many students dream of moving into the vibrant and colourful district and building lives around their creative passions.]]>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/generalstore.jpg"/> <p><strong>In the narrow streets of the Lola district in Vekllei</strong>, artisans and artists hurry about, peddling art and fine goods and attracting the rest of the city to its stores. In Vekllei, there is no currency, so shopping is almost always a pragmatic affair.</p>
<p>Not in Lola. If you’re in Lola, you’re there to see the <em>good stuff</em>, produced and sold in little shops like this one. The apartments of this place are small and cramped, and the streets are rarely wide enough for vehicles to pass, but many students dream of moving into the vibrant and colourful district and building lives around their creative passions. Coffee shops here are filled with notebooks and haggard young things, penning their screenplays and worrying about their existential purpose.</p>
<p>Vekllei is a society of restlessly educated people, looking for some greater satisfaction in their lives without the incentives of money. Many serve their country, others fall in love. This shop owner found his. He stocks books, apples, rare foodstuffs and anything that takes his fancy, like an eclectic general store. There are few supermarkets in the country. The demands of the collectivised economy for constant overproduction and total employment results in decentralised distribution like we see here. Tzipora is eleven. She doesn’t understand all that. But she understands that her mother wants spiced meats for a platter, and Lola is the best place to find seasonal or exotic foods like spiced meat.</p>
<p>Twelve festivals rouse creativity out of the otherwise sleepy Vekllei economy. The <em>festival of feasts</em>, in September, halts regular production and many restaurants switch to exotic foods. During this month, cafes and restaurants are overflowing with people jawing about where they’ve been while cramming their mouths with Oriental, American and South American staples. Following September is October’s <em>festival of the sea</em>, the climax of which includes the detonation of a nuclear bomb out at sea and a slow, luxurious media worship of the enormous warships that Vekllei operates.</p>
<p>Tzipora ducks under the curtain in the doorway of the store, and wipes her nose on the back of her arm. The bag full of meats is heavy for her. It’s a long walk back to her apartment building, but on warm autumn evenings like these, that’s not a bad thing. She waves goodbye and leaves.</p>
<p>If you have questions or comments, I love both. <em>Thanks for listening!</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>The bones of an angel</strong>, either bioengineered in the kilns of an ancient civilisation before ours or fallen from the spirit world, are sacred and insanely jealous of human life. Here, the forgotten bones of an angel try to scare Tzipora by filling her lungs with blood. She knows better — she’s friends with the spirits of this place — but the trick still scares her. Many such bones litter the earth, but few are found on the surface.</p>
<p>Ancient creatures that lie dormant below the surface of the world have been disturbed by the nuclear war between China and the U.S. If awakened, the creatures — called Lehmenan by forgotten peoples — will use lances of fire to cleanse the Earth. In this moment, in a field of flowers in rural Vekllei, eleven-year-old Tzipora acts as an ambassador of the human race, and pleads with the spirit world to forgive the destruction of the North American and East Asian continents.</p>

I remember being surprised by how many of them were in basements  —  probably because they thought the gas would blow away in the wind. The entire town was dead, and we were worried that the gasses were still lingering, so the unit wore their masks as we began to cremate them. The flies lay eggs in the heat and that’s all anyone talked about; lots of flies. They gave us cigarettes to mask the smell.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I remember very clearly a man in our unit, who is dead now but was only new then, throwing up in the gutter outside what had been a grocery store. He looked up at me and saw me watching, and he said, “this fucking sucks,” and then threw up again. I had watched him execute P.O.W.s, and treat combat wounds without flinching, and he was a tough guy  —  you know; big, heavyset  —  but here I was watching him put his guts on the sidewalk. I left the crematory pit in the city square and went to relieve him, and I found the bodies of forty-five children no older than seven or eight, squished up in a corner of the basement, crushing their friends, because whatever gas had been swirling down the stairwell was so thick that they could see it coming.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—  Excerpt from <em>The Cost of Chemical Warfare</em> article, the New York Times, October 21st 2064.</p>
<p>The troops pictured form part of the Vekllei expeditionary forces, an experienced group that deals largely with war crimes and militarised espionage. They operate in coordination with the secret services and military police. A New York Times photojournalist attached with Unit 75 in northeast Taiwan documented the consequences of heavy chemical shelling in rural Taiwan, and saw just a small number of the hundreds of thousands killed in the Sino-Taiwanese war.</p>

<p>She is clever, sensitive, and deeply humanist. Despite her shyness and her loneliness, she is remembered by the few whose lives she touched as an affectionate and exceptionally gifted girl.</p>
<p>She has a chronic sadness about her. She feels distinct and separated from the human race, a feeling exacerbated by her Gregori syndrome and a mild obsessive-compulsiveness that makes her feel like a freak. She turns her emotions into words and often falls asleep at her desk, writing a story about a fantasy world she calls Yellowstone.</p>
<p>She is conscious of the world in a way few eleven-year-olds are, and deeply patriotic. Despite her friendlessness, she carries on with good intentions and concern for the future. She bore witness to the atomic bombing of Vekllei in September of 2063.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/desertspirit.jpg"/> <p><strong>Every natural place has a spirit that minds it</strong>. Tzipora had never met a desert spirit before, and she went looking for one in Cherry, Nevada. With air force jets glinting in the sky overhead, and the temperature scorching the mesas that surround the military town, she found one inside a burrow. In an instant, it had transformed into a rattlesnake and tried to scare her, but she dropped to her knees and begged it to forgive her for waking it. She offered it a gumdrop and it returned to its natural, translucent form.</p>
<p>Spirits are placed on earth by whatever God watches over the Earth. Tzipora dislikes the God of the world, but she respects the spirits, and as a child she can see them in their natural state. In Vekllei and Scandinavia, they are called Faeries. In Japan, they are spirits. In the United States, there is no word for them, because they are considered to not exist.</p>
<p>Tzipora asked the spirit to watch over her and her father when they are in the desert. From that day on, she left an offering outside in a makeshift shrine in the backyard of their detached midcentury home.</p>
<p>Tzipora has no time for God; she is a zealous humanist at her core. The spirits are fair and good. Because of them, Vekllei is environmentally conscious in a way few other great powers are in 2063.</p>
<p>The written characters are Vekllei, and make a poem;</p>
<p><em>Tzipora is looking for all good things in the world</em></p>
<p><em>The spirits are the mothers and daughters of all good things in the world</em></p>
<p><em>What a beautiful place, crafted in the love between the Earth and children</em></p>
<p>If you have any questions, I like to hear them. If you’ve got illustration tips, I wouldn’t mind some too ;)</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/fashion.jpg"/> <p><strong>Vekllei kids look to America as a bastion of good taste</strong>; a country of fast cars and diners and sock-hops and high-school romance. Like the Koreans look to Japanese taste, and the British look to the stuff coming out of design houses in France, Vekllei is infatuated with how Americans dress in the year 2063. Like most imported culture in Vekllei, the American teen-age style is misunderstood, butchered, and then transformed into something entirely different as production lines crank out plaid skirts, two-tone shoes and baseball jerseys for Vekllei kids.</p>
<p>Tzipora doesn’t buy into much of that stuff. She doesn’t have any friends to show off to, but boy, <em>if she did</em>, they’d all be jealous of her. While living in Cherry, Nevada, Tzipora experienced American life first-hand. She bought her clothes in American department stores and ate in American diners. Her nose was pulped by American fists after she stayed silent in the American national anthem. Tzipora doesn’t get on with American kids much  —  she doesn’t get along with a lot of things, it seems. <strong>But gee, what would the kids at her old school in Vekllei say when she turned up in jerseys and trousers?</strong> Wouldn’t that just be something? They’d regret making fun of her then.</p>
<p><strong>Left to right:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Trying on an all-wool sack-type dress for the first time. It’d be pretty if she didn’t live in a desert.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Vekllei jersey patterned with blossoms, a popular motif. To the American kids, abstract prints on American-style clothes mark her out as a foreigner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Three-quarter-length trousers with white penny loafers. Her T-shirt bears the Vekllei emblem for the moon, but to non-Vekllei it looks Japanese.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pulling her shoes back on after she was dragged around the back of the school and roughed up for ignoring the national anthem. She didn’t know the words. She knows how to get blood out of a shirt, so it&rsquo;s no biggie. Besides, she got a couple good hits in. If there wasn&rsquo;t five of them, she reckoned she could have fought off Yankee kids.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve got any questions, I love ‘em. Thanks for listening.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/terror.jpg"/> <p><strong>Louenne Dehmones enlisted for two years but stayed for ten.</strong> He served abroad in the war department, where he performed admirably but never rose above the rank of Junior Sergeant because of a good-natured appetite for mischief. He transferred to the military police to be close to his wife and infant daughter.</p>
<p>It was his daughter that he thought of as he powdered the wounds of the girl at the airport with instaskin, and it was of his daughter that he thought as he picked up the girl’s body, smoke still pouring from the cavity in her chest, and carried her to the ambulances that were wailing all over the airport. A bomb of white phosphorous had exploded in the ouisha park outside the terminal. Without his gas mask or gloves, he picked raw phosphorous out of the girl’s chest with his fingers and cauterised her wounds, saving her life.</p>
<p>The girl’s name was Lola Talounes, and she was one of six wounded in the blast who survived the attack, almost entirely because of the actions of Louenne. The attack at the airport preceded two more terrorist attacks on Vekllei soil, before the collapse of the United Nations Security Council and the subsequent thermonuclear war. In the aftermath of it all, in which Louenne went on to save many more lives as a civil defense authority in his apartment block, he was finally promoted to Sergeant. Lola still writes him, and wants to be an cosmonaut.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/ageing.jpg"/> <p><strong>This is Tzipora.</strong> She is eleven years old, scruffy, and a <strong>Gregori baby</strong>. At the turn of the 21st century, Gregori Hordiyenko, a Ukrainian boy aged nine and a half, stopped aging entirely. By 2063, which is the year Tzipora turned eleven, there are about two hundred Gregori babies in the world, mostly living in secret. Certain religious sects, including Catholics, view Gregori babies as a sign of the Lord’s action and as a movement towards an approaching religious event. Other religious sects see them simply as angels, eternal beings fallen from heaven.</p>
<p>In reality little is known about the phenomenon. Gregori babies stop growing at the point they’d usually reach thelarche. Their cells reproduce perfectly, removing the ageing process entirely and making them theoretically immortal. The oldest Gregori baby is fifty-six and lives in Florida. Gregori himself was run down and killed in an accident in his twenties. Gregori babies have no other defining characteristic; they have been found in the Orient and in Africa and in Europe, they have different levels of wellness and many have entirely unremarkable lives.</p>
<p><strong>Tzipora is Vekllei’s first Gregori baby</strong>, although she was abroad when she was diagnosed. She has not reached menarche and does not appear to have even begun thelarche. Other than her agelessness, she is a normal girl with her own anxieties and joys and relationships. As a child, she has not yet quite understood the magnitude of what has been stripped from her: she will never be able to maintain friends as they age without her, she will never grow up or marry, and assuming she naturally survives, she will watch everyone die before her. As a Gregori baby, she can be killed as any other human being can. The one exception to her condition is cancer and tumour-related diseases, of which she will be immune.
Her father calls her “angel”, and the pet name took on a new meaning as her condition was realised.</p>
<p>Tzipora is religious and believes in a single God and spirits, but dislikes him and blames him for her own situation, shifting her faith into Vekllei and humanity.
Let me know if you have any questions. I love to talk.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/fiveuniforms.jpg"/> <p>These are the five basic outfits a kid in the city of Vekllei rotates between in their life. This is Tzipora. She’s sharp and a little scruffy.  She’s eleven years old.</p>
<p><strong>The first</strong> is her school uniform, complete with embroidered armband featuring the national crest. The skirt has a longer pleated section. She wears penny loafers.</p>
<p><strong>The second</strong> is the uniform of the Vekllei Blossoms, equivalent to the Pioneers in the USSR and Red China, or Boy Scouts in the West. The uniforms are designed around mobility and athleticism, as the focus of these groups has drifted from militarism and centres firmly on nature, building good habits, and instilling the spiritual philosophy of Vekllei in future generations.</p>
<p><strong>The third</strong> is the national dress of Vekllei. It is beautiful, detailed and unique to each girl who wears it. You can find a full-colour picture of this girl in her national dress, with accompanying information, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/6o1k7x/she_stands_in_the_harbour_in_national_dress_jets/">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The fourth</strong> is her casual clothes. Although this is informed by the taste of the girl, this collared shirt and skirt is pretty representative of fashion in 2063. Little flamingos print her white shirt. Flamingos are a popular motif in Vekllei. She holds a magnetic tape reader in her hand that plays music, like ones found in the United States. She can clip it onto the waist of her skirt and do chores while she listens.</p>
<p><strong>The fifth</strong> is a hastily-assembled civil defence volunteer uniform. She is in pyjamas, dressed only in slippers and a long shirt, having awakened seconds before, but she wears the armband with the civil defence logo, a heavy helmet to protect her head and carries a high-beam torch. In the event the sirens go off, she will knock on the doors of neighbouring apartments and guide elderly residents to shelters while older and more experienced folk will tackle more complex duties.</p>
<p>I love to talk and I love questions, so give ‘em to me. Thanks for listening!</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/bullying.jpg"/> <p>This poster circulated middle schools in 2063 as part of a wider initiative at curbing violence against women at an early age. The two Vekllei characters on the left read literally as &ldquo;there is no excuse to hit a female,&rdquo; but it emphasises the ‘hit’ part of it to make the idea particularly reprehensible. The girl pictured wears Vekllei middle school uniform, including a red armband with the national crest on it. The Vekllei seal, the four-petal eloise flower, sits about the text to confirm the authority of the poster. The poster is targeted at young boys; there is plenty of girl-on-girl bullying, including physical, that is not addressed by this campaign.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/nationaldress.jpg"/> <p>Tzipora, a recent immigrant girl of eleven years, wears the feminine national dress of Vekllei. It is a delicate, traditional and deeply spiritual costume, and is tied to Vekllei’s foundations and aspirations as a state. It has political symbolism, but it also ties the girl to the land she stands on.</p>
<p>Underneath her Lawtsk Ohma (an equivalent phrase might be &ldquo;Maiden’s Apron, in English, but it loses the emotion of the original phrase; it insinuates youthful innocence and domesticity, industry and love) is a wide lace half-petticoat that sits over her skirt. These are extraordinarily detailed and extremely delicate. Each one is different and is tailored to the girl who wears it, and usually builds its patterns from the girl’s birth month and accompanying festival, demeanour and year of her birth. An entire industry exists to produce these lace garments and Vekllei women are traditionally buried with them.</p>
<p>A recurring symbol is a stylised image of the Eliese Orchid, a four-petal flower that naturally grows in Vekllei and represents the seat of power in the city-state and the blood of the citizenry. On her left side she wears the Industry Roundel Star, a common collectivist symbol. Today she wears a black armband on her left arm in mourning, after the atomic bombings of the Lola and Leh Moleneis prefectures, which killed many thousands of her countrymen.</p>
<p>The year is 2063 and the world is unravelling. Tzipora trusts her country. But she worries for it, too; if Europe falls to the Soviets and China seizes Japan, Vekllei won’t have many friends in the world left.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="/images/youthmeet.jpg"/> <p>Tzipora is smiling in the photo because she has won the competition for multilingual spelling. She is a recent citizen of <strong>Vekllei</strong>, a postcollectivist country in what we know as Iceland. She beat American boy scouts, Australian girl guides, Chinese and Soviet Pioneers and other youth organisations to win top prize.</p>
<p>The <strong>International Youth Meet</strong> is a games hosted biannually. Tzipora is representing the Vekllei Occupation Zone in Germany with a half-dozen other girls from the O.Z. The games of 2063 are hosted in Bremen, Germany, less than 80 kilometres from the Polish border and the site of a brief nuclear exchange between the U.S. occupation zones and Soviet Poland eight days after this photo was taken.</p>
<p>Tzipora wears the uniform of the <strong>Vekllei Blossoms</strong>, the female youth wing of Vekllei. She is eleven years old. The hammer and sickle pin she wears is not standard issue; it was pulled from a Soviet submariner hat she was given. The international community generally does not trust Vekllei. At the games, in their pastel cardigans, the Vekllei Blossom girls are targets for suspicion and bullying from the rest of the youth groups.</p>
<p>I’m an Aussie world builder. My world is one stuck in the nuclear age forever. Things are unravelling. Tzipora is worried about the safety of her parents and the future of the world. I haven’t posted before, so if you’re interested, ask me anything!</p>
