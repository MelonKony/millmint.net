This article appeared in Issue #5 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.In Vekllei, uniforms are prevalent across all levels of society. They are perhaps the most obvious example of the opaque contradictions at the heart of Vekllei life, caught between wholly opposing ideas: between tradition and progress; liberty and control; and, most crucially here ‚Äî between individualism and the burden of society.</description>

      <description>On the morning of the second day, I watched a fly crawl across the cheek of the middle-aged woman, probably an office worker, lying next to me. It moved up her cheekbone to her temple, stopping now and then to rub its front legs as though performing a ritual. A jagged tear ran down the leg of her dark blue work trousers, but the white calf it revealed was miraculously unscathed.</description>

      <title>Rural Newda in Rural Vekllei</title>
      <link>https://millmint.net/posts/2020-08-17-house/</link>

      <description>Newda is Vekllei‚Äôs national architectural ideology, applied flexibly in a range of modernist styles developed domestically in her architecture schools. Broadly, Newda buildings emphasise distinction from the surrounding landscape (called Dumousiantopet, or ‚Äòbeautiful and seperate‚Äô), natural decay, and honesty in material and construction. Vekllei‚Äôs great Parliament House is Newda; as are the little rural homes found in the mountains inland in Vekllei.
Tzipora‚Äôs house in the village of Montre-Lola (as depicted on the map here) is built in what Vekllei calls ‚ÄúAzores revivalism‚Äù, a Newda style heavily influenced by the stripped deco and streamline moderne buildings of a century prior.</description>

      <description>The concept of living forever jumps out at people uncomfortable with their own existence. There is a contemplative instinct among educated people that ‚Äî if they could simply will themselves into a state of self-actualisation ‚Äî death would only be an obstacle to greatness.
As Tzipora found out quickly, the opposite was true ‚Äî death and temporality were wells of meaning against which all great people, beauty, and human constructions were cast.</description>

      <description>The Epoch of Rest#We‚Äôve spent a lot of time in the 21st century ‚Äî but Tzipora is biologically immortal. Where does she go from here? Well, let‚Äôs enjoy a small glimpse at that future together, by winding the clock forward one thousand years.
By 3076, our Solar System is a pleasant place to be. Most of the planets we once gazed at from afar are now habitable and lived on.</description>

      <title>Summer House in the Azores</title>

      <description>The Azores had been a possession of Vekllei since 2002, when they were leased from Portugal indefinitely. The lease was defunct by the time of Vekllei‚Äôs independence from U.K. occupation in 2015, and the new state took formal ownership over the small Atlantic islands.
The Azores was Vekllei‚Äôs resort region, often called simply the ‚Äúholiday isles‚Äù. Brief reprieves from the North Atlantic cold were granted to hundreds of thousands domestic tourists each year in resorts and holiday rentals alike.</description>

      <title>The Race for Inefficiency ‚Äî Vekllei‚Äôs advocation of austerity, apathy, and playfulness as economic principles</title>

      <description>This post is about the economy of Vekllei. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a long one. If you have any questions, just ask.
Overview of the Bureau System#There are many thousands of companies busy with work in Vekllei. The vast majority of these companies are single-person shops (S.p.A., or senrouiva pettetie anaproiouya). Also common are wobbly shops, or co-operative businesses (S.q.A., or senrouiva qualitie anaproiouya). The largest of the non-bureau companies are village factories (S.</description>

      <title>Police in Vekllei</title>

      <description>There are two regular police organs in Vekllei.
 Fedecenoayan porits (national police, or venopor) Comoisniyan denporitsa (local police, or cosmopor)  A young venopor officer stands on the left, in the full street regalia they‚Äôre renowned for. Unlike cosmopor, they often carry machine guns while on patrol and are stationed outside of government buildings, hospitals, train stations, ports, schools and any company managed directly by a bureau, which is a trade organ of national importance.</description>

      <description>Map Key
 Red: Magjet trains, 750km/h
Yellow: Bullet trains, 300-400km/h
Orange: Regional trains, &amp;lt;150km/h
Brown: Local trains, including limited express, &amp;lt;100km/h
Blue: National highway
Dashed: Ferry line
Green: tarmacadamed airport
 The largest division of any portion of Vekllei land is the borough; a region of varying size and population with common culture, food dependency and economic interest. Anything larger than that is simply Vekllei ‚Äî they are ‚Äúone city‚Äù, after all, and consider themselves a city-state.</description>

      <title>The Vekllei Crown ‚Äî coins of a moneyless country</title>

      <description>Vekllei, legendarily, does not use circulate currency. Goods and services are moved and offered arbitrarily, provided amply in abundance. Anything that is not abundant is manufactured and distributed directly under the control of a bureau, which is a trade organ responsible to the affairs of the country. At no point do coins or paper currency change hands in the day-to-day affairs of the country.
In this sense, Vekllei is usually described as ‚Äúmoneyless‚Äù ‚Äî yet it does in fact have a currency.</description>

      <description>The village of Montre-Lola is home to about 400 people in its entirety, a stone‚Äôs throw from the Aisyo borough. Each morning, however, the population swells as 300 children from tiny villages in both Aisyo and Montre take a fast tram to the Montre-Lola Area School No. 2, a district school raising all ages of local youth.
Like many Vekllei villages, Montre-Lola‚Äôs history is complex and has origin stories in both viking-inuit settlement as well as less sentimental government programmes that flourished after the atomic war.</description>

      <title>The Oa-Class Battlecruiser</title>

      <description>Vekllei‚Äôs defensive military posture has, in doctrine and arms development, limited its ability to meaningfully project power outside of the Atlantic. As an island nation with a large and multifaceted naval armada, the Oa-Class Battlecruiser is the heart of her armed forces, as the flagship of her fleets.
Where U.S. doctrine places carriers offensively in the structure of its ship-groups, the Vekllei Navy is considerably more Soviet in its employ of carriers as primarily defensive air-bases to exercise sovereignty over her far-flung territories and island possessions.</description>

      <description>Atlantic Salmon was the best in the world, and Vekllei had a lot of it. Ocean-going fishing boats brought their haul to Ro, where they cruised wide postwar canals and unloaded tonnes of shiny, bright salmon into processing plants. If a new factory was built, so too was a canal or a railroad. Nothing was trucked. Fish was traded fresh in markets or turned into emulsifiers and fertiliser.
The canals were worked heavily, and few fishing vessels were incorporated.</description>

      <title>Fission Cloud at Vekllei&#39;s 50th Anniversary</title>

      <description>In an unprecedented event, during Vekllei‚Äôs 50th Sea Festival since Independence in 2065, an 8 kiloton fission bomb was sunk to a depth of 150 meters and detonated at midday. It was an incredible sight on a day so clear you could see the gentle curve of the earth where it met the horizon. A flash of light and a spray dome surged outwards into the quiet Atlantic, which was broken apart by plumes that formed a column of water that climbed high into the sky.</description>

      <title>Winter Uniforms in Vekllei</title>

      <description>When I paint Vekllei, I usually depict the warmer months. Hems are shorter, days are longer, and the destabilisation of the world‚Äôs climate has only benefited these arctic people. At the gift end of the Vekllei low pressure system, Scandinavian misery has become Mediterranean pleasure, with warm summers and a mild Autumn and Spring.
Still, by late October, the the earth is hard with cold and the days are short.</description>

      <description>Baron had inherited the apartment from his uncle, who passed in the year following his parents. It was in a mixed residential-industrial neighbourhood, adjacent to a canvas factory. Out back was a rivulet, which roared in the long rainstorms of early April.
 Each January, the Colour Bureau of the Architecture Assembly announces the year‚Äôs colours, and tradition in mainstream architecture and interior design is to incorporate the announced palettes, which usually contain a hundred or so colours.</description>

      <description>After three days in Ada, Tzipora set off towards Mt Miya. She made good time, and after three hours had happened upon the shoulders of the bright Volouisnesnkull Glacier. It was about here that she heard a morbid industrial siren, echoing up the valleys from far away.
At first she thought it might have come from Ada, since Boya Chemical had a large plant there, but as she lay out her things for lunch she heard the distinct whine of a turbojet.</description>

      <description>East of Montre, West of Tjornes, waits a rare sight among Vekllei‚Äôs hard igneous slopes ‚Äî a crown of gentle sedimentary cliffs packed with ruddy sandstone, which melt glacially into the sea chasing blue-sky bergs.
Tzipora was, at the time, making her way on foot from Montre-Lola to Ada, which was a coastal town in the North-East known for its luxurious health spas. Tzipora was not much interested in health, but she was interested in walking, and she made a pilgrimage along the coast every few years to make sense of the world.</description>

      <description>Station Dogs#I‚Äôm starting a series looking at the lives and machines of domestic Vekllei life.
Vekllei National Railways, or ‚ÄòVK Rail‚Äô was the bastard of six major pre-war rail companies that were extinguished along with the society that housed them. Today there are three rail companies in Vekllei, but all of them operate under direct supervision of a Vekllei Industry Bureau (making it Venrouiva, in other words) and are only broken up for reasons of logistics.</description>
