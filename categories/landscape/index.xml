&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children of the children of the bomb —&lt;/strong&gt; a generation of war-babies born in peacetime. That was how they thought of themselves. Their grandparents and great-grandparents had lived through the war and the occupation, and so they had inherited the burden of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s future as a country of long-sufferers, visionaries, and dispossessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Marxist continental intellectual had said something a half-century ago about the right way to teach children, and the idea had probably caught the ear of some commissar of the Vekllei interim government, who perhaps passed it along to some bureaucrat rebuilding the government schools. As a result, Vekllei children only go to school three or four days a week. There, they spend only a few hours a day in classrooms. There is, after all, no real workforce for which they are being primed. &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/posts/2020-07-13-economy/#play&#34;&gt;Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s labour economy is a play-fantasy&lt;/a&gt;, and so they mostly learn how to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not designed to &amp;lsquo;free&amp;rsquo; children — Vekllei schools have hierarchies, punishments and are mandatory &amp;mdash; instead, the primary goal of education is self-discovery and self-respect. It is precisely these qualities that benefit most the modern Vekllei economy, which is heavily automated and competes internationally through the product of its participatory creative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no grading system in Vekllei — all classes are passed or failed. The value of compulsory education through government schools, then, is the socialisation of boys and girls with others boys and girls, and the availability of equipment and facilities to participate in extracurricular activities. This is the real body of Vekllei school life — its clubs, societies, and individual associations. Many professional photographers in this country discovered an affection for photography before they turned 15 years old, through exposure to it in school. These resources, and the need to socialise children with others, are the reasons the Vekllei government continues to universalise government schooling, even alongside home-schooling or independent/religious education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depicted here are the good-natured youth of the new generation in school uniform — &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/posts/2020-09-08-uniforms/&#34;&gt;a topic we&amp;rsquo;ve visited before&lt;/a&gt;. All students in Vekllei wear the same uniform, including at university. The uniforms themselves are not designed specifically to regulate appearance — and to this end, schools do not have dress codes regarding hair or cultural/religious accessories including jewellery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discard any assumptions about the meaning behind the colour or style of their clothes — all variations depicted here can be worn by whomever, no matter their age, school or association. In fact, school uniforms are not provided directly by schools — they are found at department stores, on the rack alongside suits and dresses. Because of this fact, specific styles of shirt, trousers, socks and shoes vary between students — and are acceptable as long as they meet the basic requirements of the uniform. This intersection of control and anarchy can be found widely throughout broader Vekllei society, and is an interesting example of how the basic principles of the &amp;ldquo;Vekllei way of life&amp;rdquo; are reflected in the microscopic mundanities of life and foundations of national culture simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the voices we hear, isn&amp;rsquo;t there an echo of now silent ones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Walter Benjamin, &lt;em&gt;On the Concept of History&lt;/em&gt;, 1942&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tzipora remembered living in the twilight of the dying world&lt;/strong&gt;, and how quiet it seemed in Vekllei in those years. It had an effect on the air; on the grass. Tzipora was very good at admiring the mundane, and the spaces it inhabited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landscape is all around us, all of the time. It does not just occur in scenery, or in nature. And it can be very difficult to see landscape for what it is, because our interiors &amp;mdash; our selves &amp;mdash; announce themselves constantly. In order to enjoy the quiet physicality of everyday life, you have to quiet that voice. What is left is the senses, and intuition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei was full of these sensory feelings, because it was full of physical things. It was breaking down, one after the other, the mental burdens of modernity. Not just in big ways; in money and in work. But in small ways too, in how we experienced places and how we thought of and understood our possessions. Upen explicitly describes an animism &amp;mdash; all things are alive. But you don&amp;rsquo;t need to believe in Upen to understand that, it&amp;rsquo;s evident throughout Vekllei. The complicated, nonsensical machinations of Vekllei society: &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/posts/2020-07-13-economy/&#34;&gt;moneylessness&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/posts/2020-10-11-metaphysic/&#34;&gt;product atheism&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/posts/2021-07-21-fashion/&#34;&gt;antifashions&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/posts/2019-11-01-schools/&#34;&gt;childlessness&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/posts/2020-12-05-gods/&#34;&gt;an absence of landscape&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/posts/2021-05-31-topet/&#34;&gt;abstractionism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/posts/2021-04-01-woman/&#34;&gt;a reclamation of womanhood&lt;/a&gt;, etc. &amp;mdash; they could not be more simple in Vekllei, where the beautiful products of such things are unannounced and plain to see. Simplicity is in fact complicated; Vekllei is complicated, and life there is simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She still had her anxiety, of course. She was a full-colour constellation of neuroses. But living was not hard; Vekllei was approaching its epoch of rest. When it arrives, no one will notice a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big things coming soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For most of her life, Tzipora dressed how she was told to dress&lt;/strong&gt;. When she was a child, her clothes were provided. When she started school, the school clothed her. After school, heading west on the trains and picking up work as she found it, she wore whatever she could afford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until her first steps inside the Cozetti Department Store in Vekllei, clothing was for gazing, not for being gazed at. Her new identity as a modern, middle-class girl had yet to emerge. It was a vacuum that needed filling in a new country where social behaviour drove your quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clothing in Vekllei is manufactured by the same ideological forces that seek to “deindustrialise” the economic processes of the country — in other words, its broad physical decommodification. This included a championing of what they indigenously called “fashion atheism” or “antifashions,” meaning fashion that was not designed to be sold. This did not necessarily require a return to the woollen jumpers and seal pelts of yesteryear — just that clothing would return to the physical immediacy of art and architecture. It became what Vekllei people call “the decoration of ordinary life;” in other words, simply decorative and exclusively physical, and unburdened by intellectual or economic fetishisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This position is inherently conservative, in the sense that it was not supposed to change quickly, but the appearance of Vekllei’s “antifashions” did not advocate for traditional native styles specifically — indeed, many antifashions were quite radical both aesthetically and ideologically, and were pioneered by some of Vekllei’s most progressive art communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employing Tzipora as an example here is not just a convenience of the project — she is a superb example of how the internationalist movement became a symbol of the global dispossessed. Her tastes were affected by her exposure to a unique style developed in the Vekllei-Italian immigrant design schools called “Nuova Grotessco Internazionale,” (Lit. International New Grotesque), which helped found her affection for simple clothing in simple colours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Grotesque” in this case comes from the Italian grotessco, a reference to forms so simple they could have been pulled from cave paintings. Although Tzipora was too sensible to ever seek them out, the showcase items of the Nuova Grotessco Internazionale movement were radical in their geometric simplicity — advocating androgynous silhouettes and “culturelessness” that looked like it came from nowhere and said nothing. Like all radical fashions, the dramatic conclusions of these ideas were moderated and filtered into general consumption in Vekllei, which went on to contribute to the popularity of new synthetic materials, space-age “cosmocorps” styles and bright geometric patterns common in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora herself was never much for the grotesque, but she was very interested in internationalist styles. She had a few choice clothing items she reproduced in most of her outfits — she liked that her pleated shirts suggested nothing about her personality, her ethnic background, or her immigrant status. The pleated shirt is simply the “decoration of ordinary life.” It was inoffensive and uncomplicated. Such is the spirit of fashion atheism and the internationalist movement: clothing should suggest nothing intrinsic about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vekllei, this idea was seen as a critical liberator of women, and elsewhere, it was seen as an extension of international democracy and cooperation; an aesthetic of endless social mobility and freedom of expression. In Vekllei, where art was very radical and influenced heavily by continental designers, it was the ultimate symbol of postwar egalitarianism and recovery. The internationalist style has become the ‘new default’ of Vekllei fashion, obscuring its ideological origins through its presence in (and simple decoration of) everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Quality of Life Surveillance Commission</title>

  Archived from the original article here
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Quality of Life Surveillance Commission (Q.L.C.)&lt;/strong&gt; is part of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Fair Work Authority&lt;/strong&gt;, and is one of the most important economic regulators in Vekllei today. In a country without money, you can think of it as the payroll of every Vekllei person — the body responsible for the welfare of Vekllei people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Vekllei does not use money domestically, the country is bound by the &lt;strong&gt;Floral Constitution&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;Dignity&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;in Employment Act 2016&lt;/strong&gt;,and the &lt;strong&gt;Fair Work Act 2022&lt;/strong&gt; to provide regular, measurable increases in the standard of living for Vekllei people. It is the responsibility of the Q.L.C. to track and report these facts, measured by three metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The satisfaction of Vekllei people with actionable markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The availability, quality, and variety of goods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The strength and maintenance of the Thousand Roses Campaign.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Thousand Roses Campaign&lt;/strong&gt; outlined a programme of comforts and consumer luxuries the Commission felt necessary for the satisfaction of Vekllei people and the opinion of Vekllei internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This programme, called the &lt;strong&gt;Thousand Roses Award&lt;/strong&gt;, reveals interesting tendencies within Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s cultural priorities as the country attempted to furnish its population with a standard of living suitable for twenty-first century life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few highlights. In its essence, fifty years after the war, the average Vekllei person should:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Own their home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have all their children in school&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work three or four days a week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holiday regularly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the Vekllei person should:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possess three pairs of shoes, for daily, recreational and formal occasions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possess clothing for each day of the week, and for all occasions, so that hygiene and dignity may be preserved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be awarded clothing for any work considered full-time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be guaranteed the provision of cosmetics and personal sanitary items.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is part of the origin of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s uniformed work culture — although the Thousand Roses Award did not intend companies to specifically provide uniforms, the simplest and most affordable way of meeting the requirements of the campaign necessitated their use. Not all companies in Vekllei provide uniforms, but they must provide clothing upon request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Award also describes the basic rights of a modern Vekllei lifestyle. Any working person should:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be guaranteed the provision of personal tools, with which maintenance can be carried out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enjoy equitable and reliable access to cinema, theatre, and live music.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cook with fresh produce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, the Thousand Roses Award covers exactly one thousand items that contribute to the state&amp;rsquo;s vision of the postwar Vekllei lifestyle. As we can see here, some of these items are yet to be achieved universally or regularly. The basic premise of the Campaign, however, has been realised — Vekllei people do indeed work few days, own their home, send their children to school and holiday regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an independent regulator of the Vekllei Government, the Quality of Life Surveillance Commission continues to hold the promises of the past to account. In a manner closely related to the Vekllei Census, Q.L.C. agents interview people throughout the year, tallying their pleasures and grievances. At the end of each year, the Commission produces a detailed report cataloguing the successes and failures that affect the Postwar Vekllei Person, and determine what Floral Society still owes them. One day, the debt will be paid in full.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Compor, Vekllei&#39;s Special Police</title>

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where Tzipora lived in Lola&lt;/strong&gt;, most people remained of the working class well into the utopian period. Despite their equitable access to the fruits of the country, their housing was poorer and their problems generational. Alcoholism was very common; many of them were veterans of the War in Taiwan. Others were in great pain from their early work in the postwar years, their bodies broken by the demons of manual labour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year after Tzipora arrived, the conviction of a Polish man for two murders sparked protests in Lola along ethnic lines. Protests were very common in Vekllei. In the postwar years, the grievances were often prejudiced, and intensified by the millions of immigrants who arrived in the renewed country, one which was reestablishing itself as a place of dignity for dispossessed people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora did not like the protests because they reminded her of where she came from. Per the echoes of the past, she too found old wartime anxiety and despair resurfacing. She was feeling what we now call battle fatigue, or the neurosis of violence — but she did not look like a soldier, and so she was not treated for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that sort of thing brought out the monster in Tzipora. She grappled with her own revulsion towards the anti-immigrant protestors. It upset her hearing the protests from her home. In her mind, she would like to see them shot where they stood. How short-sighted was tolerance in abstract — why did no one seem to recognise that people needed management; they all needed management. They needed management from their own worst instincts! She had seen the wickedness of people, and now it had followed her here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protest had fizzled out by sundown. Baron watched it from the roof with a drink, apparently unconcerned. Tzipora found herself shaking with anger and had to return inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following day, she passed by some riot officers on the way to school. She signed at them in her new &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/culture/language/#5-potenne&#34;&gt;Potenne&lt;/a&gt; to say they were doing good work. That was all she said. In her head, she was thinking &lt;em&gt;get them! Go and arrest them all. How can you just stand there and watch?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment would pass, and the thoughts would settle. She was not bloodthirsty in her heart. But that side of her threatened to surface from time to time. There was some currency to the thought that she had died overseas, and she was witnessing a life unlived in the twilight of death. There is a truthfulness to anger. That side of her felt much more ‘real’ for a long time after. That problem remained unresolved throughout most of her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Cosmpasnie Fedecenoayan Porits&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Compor&lt;/em&gt; (lit. National Police Companies), are the special paramilitary and riot control wing of the National Police, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/posts/2020-07-08-police/&#34;&gt;venopor&lt;/a&gt;. Most police in Vekllei are stationed locally, including the National Police. The Companies, however, are mobile — they move to meet riots, participate in counter-terrorism and counter-espionage operations, and support the Royal Vekllei Armed Forces in wartime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depicted here is a riot officer in “silks,” the term for the Compor uniform including revolver and long truncheon. Besides her is an armoured officer of Special Tactics, which responds to serious threats of violence. The iconic Compor shield is displayed here for documentary purposes. Special Tactics carry powerful radios designed to work in all environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei sees protests regularly for all sorts of things, including ongoing economic grievances, cultural tension, or even more commonly political events designed to pressure government. All such occasions are met with the Compor, who are feared and reviled by a country otherwise only used to local policing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There was not much different about one spirit than another&lt;/strong&gt;. Foreigners mistook Upen, the animism of Vekllei, for environmentalism — that was not the case at all. Landscapes changed, and so did the things that lived in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, humans are sentimental creatures, and they become attached to native things. It is important to seperate human desire — the protection of native plants and animals — and the interests of spirits, since they are not the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upen is at the heart of how a Vekllei person understands the world. It describes the basis of all being, and the essence of all things, called &lt;em&gt;seispri&lt;/em&gt;, lit. ‘spirits’. Some spirits are large and complex, and can resemble creatures. Others are so small and quiet, no person could ever see them. We’ll look at these later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora is wearing traditional ritual dress. Spirits are attracted to interesting things, especially precious metals and fine materials, and so outfits like these are designed to attract their attention. Smart people dress for the occasion, and to talk to spirits you must look like a spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her hat is called a &lt;em&gt;kitpek&lt;/em&gt;, lit. ‘flat hat,’ precisely because you can fold it flat. A wide-brimmed version is still worn in agriculture today. This narrow-brim version is elegant and feminine, and decorated with gold and orange. In summer, shirts stitched with gold like these can be worn. In winter, elaborate capes take their place. You can also see here the earliest form of the &lt;em&gt;gi&lt;/em&gt; still in use today, resting to the right of its sister-ornament, the &lt;em&gt;jouvismoakoisnisn&lt;/em&gt; belt, with two large tassels. The &lt;em&gt;gi&lt;/em&gt; is still worn commonly, and is even part of school uniform. The &lt;em&gt;jouvismoakoisnisn&lt;/em&gt; is not so lucky, and today is only associated with Upen ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her special tool is called a &lt;em&gt;duapolutchi&lt;/em&gt;, lit. ‘twin lights,’ which consists of a mounting stick and two hollow wooden balls filled with seeds. You shake it to announce the start of a meeting, or express happiness. For good measure, Tzipora has also slung gold chord around her neck and arms. All in all, a captivating show for most spirits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ritual dress, you are supposed to only communicate via &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/culture/language/#6-upotenne&#34;&gt;Upotenne&lt;/a&gt;, which is the physical language of runes. It’s a form of sign language that incorporates the whole body, and is understood by most Vekllei spirits. Tzipora does not know &lt;em&gt;Upotenne&lt;/em&gt; very well, so only says a few words before waving her ball-stick around. With any luck, they’ll shower her with blessings — or at the very least, not cause her harm next time she intrudes on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sky was heavy with grey and water&lt;/strong&gt;, and it bled into the air. Vekllei’s moon months were here, and with it came the end of Vekllei’s bright summer season. In came the days of coats, mist and darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora here wears &lt;em&gt;rouisha&lt;/em&gt;, loose-fitting felt pants that have been worn in Vekllei for a thousand years. They’re often worn under a skirt, but can be worn alone as trousers if you like. Today they’re elasticated around the ankles to insulate your legs. She also wears the ‘student cape,’ which is well-known overseas and often held aloft by foreigners as an example of Vekllei’s cultural sophistication. It is not nearly as special in Vekllei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single uniform in Vekllei often includes a variety of colours and styles, since its use is &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/posts/2020-09-08-uniforms/&#34;&gt;social rather than conformist&lt;/a&gt;. Tzipora demonstrates that well here, in her unfortunate collision of school gold, navy, red, and white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the air is mild and the wind is still, the mist feels good. It felt good to be in it. Sometimes it’s just good to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Royal Vekllei Air Force runs nuclear these days&lt;/strong&gt;. Just fifty years ago, that would have been unthinkable. Times change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ramoin-Dupont Aircraft Company, with help from the research subsidiary of the absurdly-named “Government Aircraft Factories,” spent about two decades trying to get a reactor to fly. It was easy enough to build a plane around a fission reactor — the problem was keeping the pilot alive. Ramoin-Dupont figured out that, for every megawatt of power, you required about 8 tonnes of rubber and lead shielding — an intolerable figure for a fighter or light aircraft of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This changed with a breakthrough at General Reactor in Montre, which had been experimenting with sunburst-style heat exchangers but couldn’t find a way to apply the technology. In air-cooled reactor setups, already established in primitive nuclear aircraft, this reactor design could significantly reduce operating temperatures and the burden of shielding with a chromium-cadmium alloy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eventual widespread refinement and adoption of these innovations changed the role of the fighter, and the satellite appearance of theatres in air warfare. The days of the air-refuelling boom or drop-tank were gone — a nuclear bomber was now able to fly continuously around the world for up to thirty years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pictured here is a RD-64 Demon, built in Government Aircraft Factories Aeroyards in Montreya. Like most nuclear fighters in Vekllei, it carries its reactor beneath its fuselage, where it can be refuelled and detached for maintenance easily without grounding the aircraft for months at a time. They are tremendously fast, and thanks to the weight savings of sunburst reactors, are tremendously well-equipped for emerging air combat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These jets can fly at up to 2,500km/h. They are designed for one purpose: interception. Official doctrine of Vekllei’s armed forces expects a nuclear war within a hundred years, and these jets are flown continuously over the Atlantic with powerful Horizonic radars, which talk to AEW planes and Vekllei’s navy to draw real-time maps of “Vekllei’s Atlantic.” Its weapon systems are controlled by military &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/posts/2021-01-11-automen/&#34;&gt;automan wetware&lt;/a&gt;, the effectiveness of which contributes to the Demon’s reputation as a fierce opponent to the rival fighter-types currently produced in the United States and the Eastern Bloc. They also hold great affection among Vekllei pilots and daydreaming children alike, as direct descendants of the biplanes and turbojet wonders of yesteryear — bred for a fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei takes a lot from its land&lt;/strong&gt;. That fact is the bedrock of the Vekllei way of life, in fact — land stewardship and dependency. In this sense, they owe a great debt to the physical landscape of the country, a concept usually translated as the ‘Landscape Sovereign’ in English. The human royals may be long dead, but Vekllei’s flowering petticoat society retains a monarch — the literal physical presence of the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several times a year, their debt is paid through the dramatic interruption of ordinary life. The ground cracks, hot sulphur fills the valleys, and streams of molten rock hiss as they emerge into the cool, temperate air of Vekllei. These are the magic mountains of Vekllei, living and breathing as creatures do; violent as creatures are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pictured here is a commuter express train in the sparsely-populated and highly volcanic borough of Troll. It’s a Mustard-56 series in VNR orange, made during its original production run in 2056. Most passengers prefer this series over older models because of its large skylights, which immerse the cars in the strikingly beautiful landscape of their commute. They are also an example of Vekllei National Rail’s shocking disregard for profitability, as lines like these are subsidised entirely by urban centres. Their function as a social engine is priceless, however, and justified easily by the experience of riding along any of these rural lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei is full of stations in the middle of nowhere&lt;/strong&gt;; platforms for people in no hurry, alighting to places never thought of before. It is in these stations that old government infrastructure projects take on a greater meaning, and cultivate an absurd sort of spirituality that touches the lives of the people who discover them. Is there anything gentler than a concrete platform in the middle of a flower-tundra, weathered and warmed by the sun?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tzefesmiousn family in the borough of Kotaismoyeh have their very own platform — they’re the only ones with a house here. There’s a couple of farms nearby, which load wool and meat onto freight trams periodically, but otherwise they’re the only commuters at their stop. Both parents work for Vekllei National Rail — Tzafi is a platform attendant and Aleph is an engineer. The kids go to school in the town of Kotaismoyeh. Their lives are entwined with rail, and their home is serviced by their station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy enough to find quiet stations like theirs in Vekllei, since fast trams only stop on command. It’s cheap enough to pour some concrete and leave it there for a hundred years. Over time, some of these platforms take the names of their commuters. These platforms become a metaphor for home itself, as the gateway to rest. Pictured is Tzefesmiousn Station, second-last on the local line.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Read Vekllei</title>

  Archived from the original article here
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an unusual post in that, a) it’s particularly text-heavy and desaturated, and b) much of its material is already available on an existing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/culture/language&#34;&gt;wiki article&lt;/a&gt; on my website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above article covers the language conceptually in pretty much all the detail you’d ever want. So, despite the heavy use of labels and text, this picture is particularly concerned with the literal appearance and structure of the Vekllei written language, called &lt;a href=&#34;http://millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/culture/language/#3-topet&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, a basic overview of the language was given &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/posts/2020-11-14-language/&#34;&gt;in this post&lt;/a&gt;. Please check it out to make sense of some of the terminology used here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The basic process of Vekllei’s main writing script (Topet) is this:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nouns and verbs are modified extensively by associating their subject with other pictographic characters, which have no phonetic value except for the core “principle” character. For example, an “emu” might be tall, or “running” may be breathless. This grouping is called a “minor demon”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The way these groupings look depends on how many associated characters you’re using. The principle can be written alone in the centre of a space. With two, they’re arranged side-by-side. With three, the principle sits on top of the other two in a triangular shape. With four, they become a quadrant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes, these groupings are enough. If everyone already knows what the principle characters means and how to vocalise it, you can leave it alone as a pictograph — a literal picture, with meaning modified by the characters of its group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quite often, however, you have to teach the reader how to say it. The minor demon lends the initial sound, and the rest have to be written in superscript next to it, as phonetic “helper” characters called hieyerette. These aren’t used as pictures, they’re used to help spell it out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Vekllei has &lt;a href=&#34;http://millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/culture/language/#1-overview&#34;&gt;several verbal, non-verbal, signed and written languages&lt;/a&gt;. They don’t all work like this. Rapotenne is basically pictographic and is very, very old. It’s mostly used for names and to talk to spirits. It’s never used for conventional writing. Indeed, for signatures, most use their sigils instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this post isn’t really intended to help you understand how the Vekllei language works, since the language is very complex and better served by the wiki article linked above. This is a showcase of style — the way the Vekllei language looks and feels on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see an example of Topet styling in this picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern, sans-serif FLORAL STYLING is most commonly used today in print, as part of the simplification and standardisation of characters. It’s designed to be easier to write for immigrants, who arrived in Vekllei by the millions after the war.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traditional, ornamented DEMONIC STYLING carries the traditional line weights and decoration of prewar Topet, and is still used in small print like novels for its better legibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most fonts in Vekllei follow in either of these two traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, this infographic makes clear the basic flow of the Vekllei language, which transforms most words into complicated, sentence-like concepts layered with designed, unique meaning. “Minor Demons” (the character groups) are not just used for poetry but in fact for all writing, as is the nature of Vekllei communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like much else in the country, a lot of the Vekllei way of thinking is deeply conceptual and abstracted, and rarely ventures into modern literalism. This is a feature built into the language, and it affects the Vekllei understanding of many cultural artefacts. For example, the Vekllei language is not really built to describe specific places — instead, the feeling and experience of mountains/beaches/streams is substituted in its place, quite literally by the pictographic nature of Topet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you read Topet, you’re not just sounding out a phonetic character — you are looking at a picture of that concept, in a transcendental fashion that prohibits specificity. This sort of indigenous conceptualisation deserves a post of its own, but hopefully this graphic has helped introduce you to the basic cadence and features of the written Vekllei word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know, as always, if you have any questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You know you’re near the homeland of the Magma-Electric Commission when you smell it.&lt;/strong&gt; Somewhere between cracking a rotten egg and standing downwind of a sewerage treatment plant, the volcanic heartlands of Vekllei are the playground of the Magma-Electric Commission, often shortened to just “The Magma” or “Thunderburo”. The smell is caused by Hydrogen Sulphide, a byproduct of the naked volcanic activity Vekllei is known for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulphur is everywhere in Vekllei — even in the cities, the drinking water smells of it. It even overpowers the perfume of a ro, the Vekllei flower-tundras. In the places where the smell is most intense, you usually find a geothermal power plant nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vekllei, The Magma pumps water deep into the belly of the Earth, so deep that the temperature and pressure cause the water to go supercritical, at which point it’s neither a liquid or a gas. Supercritical water carries much more energy than water or steam, and produces much more electricity — so much so that residences in Vekllei are powered entirely by geothermal (Magma-Electric Commission) and hydroelectric (Hydro-Electric Commission) facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a so-called “flash plant” in Miyatvousi, in the Lava region of Vekllei. Lava is full of plants like these. A rail line runs near its injection well, where fresh glacial runoff is transformed into clean, limitless electricity through the miracle of its landscape and human ingenuity. The water is recycled, but excess waste water is dumped into the surrounding ro, forming foggy pools of light blue water. The earth here is alive; in the cold, the ponds begin to steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moise had complicated ambitions of becoming a filmmaker. As with all student filmmakers, he drafted his friends to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His girlfriend, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/locjnz/turning_things_around/&#34;&gt;Coretti&lt;/a&gt;, operated the compact 8mm camera. Tzipora was the production assistant, doing makeup and foley and whatever he asked of her. Cobian was going to be a star — that’s what he said to her, anyway, and he paired her up with a mate of his in what would be an epic short film about lost love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Tzipora who suggested Miyatvousi, since she’d developed a good catalogue of scenic locations in her quest to find natural shrines. There was a place where the rail line crossed a small mineral lake, near the flash plant’s turbine halls. If worked out just right, you could have a shot that’d make the whole film. It was a hell of a journey — a bullet train in the morning to Krafla, where they got breakfast, and a two-hour local train far out from the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it unfolds, you never realise how good a moment is. It was maybe the second or third-best day of Tzipora’s life. She didn’t know Coretti all that well, and it was the first time they’d talked about things other than Moise. They were on a great adventure, and they all knew it. They laughed when Moise coughed out his coffee all over himself and pretended to be interested when Tzipora talked at length about how geothermal power plants work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, the gig had been sort of a joke for Cobian — she was humouring the friend of her girlfriend — but as the film progressed, she realised how talented and passionate her friends were. They were deeply odd and talented people, and they believed in what they were doing — Cobian had never had friends like that before. On the train back to Lola, as the city lights of the capital loomed, Cobian turned to Tzipora and told her that she loved her for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambitious, arrogant, naive, laughing, well-fed, tired, and in love. Looking back, Tzipora thought the candid footage of themselves made better cinema than anything in a theatre. Lights, camera — action.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Vekllei Breakfast</title>

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Postwar Vekllei has a problem&lt;/strong&gt;. In the old days, many hundreds of years ago, Vekllei’s long, dark winters forced subsistence farmers to preserve their dishes for six or seven months of the year. This changed under the Junta, which opened trade with the Scandinavian powers, and Vekllei soon saw its growing population dependent on fresh imports of oats and grain from Europe. These Atlantic people, whose diets were previously gamey and nomadic, were now a rough storm away from famine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the diets are the same but the pressures on food production are even more intense. This island has nearly 22 million people on it. The postwar Vekllei Government is terrified of the vulnerability of its indigenous, isolated ecosystems, and heavily restricts raw food imports. Meanwhile, Vekllei cuisine values freshness, localism and sustainability. These are facts that cannot coexist in a place that cannot reliably grow food outside for half the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple answer, then, is that Vekllei cuts corners on its food production. It does not attempt to reliably produce meat, which effectively banishes traditional cuisine to rural areas and those willing to hunt puffins themselves. For what animals are slaughtered, all parts of their body are used, and quite often all you’ll find at a butcher is sweetbreads and black pudding. Quality meat is synthetic, grown as isolated cells in massive liquid solutions. Even blood and organs are synthesised in industrial quantities for human consumption. Vegetables, which only entered the mainstream diet of Vekllei in the 20th Century, are grown in huge quantities under sun lamps, powered by limitless fission. The factory process of synthesising foods is called &lt;em&gt;sincrestiprosmaious&lt;/em&gt; (lit. &lt;em&gt;Grown/Made Produce&lt;/em&gt;, or similar).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these unusual facts in mind, let’s take a look at a breakfast feast prepared by Commis Chef Tzipora, which features a selection of indigenous Vekllei breakfast foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic composition of a Vekllei breakfast is its proteins (egg, meats, and cheese), drinks (coffee, citrus juice, or light breakfast tea), fried or raw vegetables (potato and rutabaga) and sweet items (usually a bun, pastry, or breakfast roll and honey).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The humble &lt;strong&gt;egg&lt;/strong&gt; is a staple rarely in short supply in Vekllei, and one or two are scrambled or fried most mornings, often assembled on &lt;strong&gt;rye&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;briga&lt;/strong&gt; (a soft Vekllei cheese with a taste similar to feta) and &lt;strong&gt;gos&lt;/strong&gt; (bitter Vekllei moss). Scrambled eggs are especially popular due to their availability, a result of their ease of synthesis, and flavoured with &lt;strong&gt;red spice&lt;/strong&gt; (factory chilli) or herbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genuine meat is scarce in Vekllei and eaten only occasionally, most commonly in rural areas close to livestock. Most genuine breakfast meats consist of cold, sliced &lt;strong&gt;ham&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;sausages&lt;/strong&gt;, which are packed with breadcrumbs due to meat scarcity. Vekllei has a type of blood sausage made of genuine pork blood or synthetic substitutes grown in stem cell hematopoietic vats, which are packed with oatmeal, groats and mint, making a black pudding called &lt;strong&gt;rue bouismesn&lt;/strong&gt; (lit. &lt;em&gt;Blood Sausage&lt;/em&gt;). Lamb sausages, called &lt;strong&gt;blanc oa bouismesn&lt;/strong&gt; (lit. &lt;em&gt;White Sausage&lt;/em&gt;) are also common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei people drink a lot of &lt;strong&gt;tea&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;coffee&lt;/strong&gt; — about 7 pounds a year of each. They eat a lot of bread and pastry — about 200 pounds a year. They like their butter and lamb, but don’t go in much for pork. Game, like puffins, are eaten regularly, though less than seafood or lamb. All of these items are eaten with breakfast in various ways, most famously &lt;strong&gt;agne loh lebeau&lt;/strong&gt; (lit. &lt;em&gt;Lamb Butter&lt;/em&gt;) which is a delicious buttery meat spread for toast, or &lt;strong&gt;lava oa agnetunfisk&lt;/strong&gt; (lit. &lt;em&gt;Buttered Lava Tuna&lt;/em&gt;), which is cooked until it falls apart and assembled with potatoes and eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei people like rich, sweet foods, and we can see that here at breakfast. Coffee is sweetened with condensed milk or raw sugar and stirred thoroughly with milk. Tea is much the same. We have here a &lt;strong&gt;long pastri&lt;/strong&gt;, a “long pastry” filled with fruit, which is eaten with (and often dipped in) your hot drink. A large spiced bun with coconut icing, called a &lt;strong&gt;sibun&lt;/strong&gt; (lit. &lt;em&gt;Pale Bun&lt;/em&gt;) is a native favourite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei people love food. In a way, it has satisfied the vacuum of moneyless society. It is bargained for help, traded for goods, and gifted for favour. It is also one of the largest compromises of Vekllei’s way of doing things. Upen has a very clear materials hierarchy — things made by you, from things around you, which you understand and respect are best. Below that, there are high quality local things made by others. At the very bottom are synthetic, man-made, factory-produced materials churned out to meet demand. Food in Vekllei undeniably exists in this last category for the vast majority of city-dwelling people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can reclaim the spiritual purity of foods somewhat by simply loving the ingredients you obtain — the black pudding might be grown in vats, but why not transform it by crumbling it over a salad with a nice vinaigrette you’ve made yourself? To alleviate some of this metaphysical tension, most Vekllei neighbourhoods are filled with greenhouses and local shared gardens, which ensures most meals have some produce in which you have participated. That’s very important. Some people think that, because Vekllei has abolished money, it has abolished the fetishism of products. The opposite is true — Vekllei life is about the love and respect of materials, a feature built into the animism of Upen. You cannot buy the best food in Vekllei — you have to find it, in a trial of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting down and enjoying food is a cornerstone of life in Vekllei. You cannot participate in society without it. For immigrants, the privacy of a quiet breakfast is good practice for the palettes and conventions of eating in Vekllei — so load up your plates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shattered fjords make up the north of Vekllei&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly in boroughs like &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/santes/&#34;&gt;Santes&lt;/a&gt; (lit. &lt;em&gt;Saint&lt;/em&gt;) which are well-regarded for their striking cliffs and sloping igneous fingers, which evidence Vekllei’s ongoing volcanism. Offshore, hundreds of islets rise and sink over the centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the tiny village of Cult, which sits on the sparse tip of the Grimsy Fjord. It has a local train, but is otherwise only serviced by the Santes regional express — a mere single step up on Vekllei’s train hierarchy. This makes it relatively isolated by Vekllei’s rail-dense metrics. Cult’s shorefront is flanked by rocky cliffs that shelter its beaches, which means most of the town is squeezed further in and higher up. By the station at sea level, only a cafe and a handful of factories greet alighting passengers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her final year of secondary school, Tzipora had developed a fascination with Upen’s “natural shrines,” which contributed to her rapidly developing brand of Judeo-Catholic Upen mysticism. Sometimes after school, when all Cobian wanted was a snack and a movie, Tzipora would drag her onto a bullet train and seek out new shrines — unique natural features — described in Upen’s sagas. They would change trains — again, then again — and finally they’d arrive in some backwater Tzipora had read about. Then they’d go looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cobian keenly remembered watching two days’ worth of essay fly out of Tzipora’s arms and scatter towards the beach in Cult, and thinking that it served her right, just a little bit. It seemed to Cobian that the winds were telling Tzipora to pack up and go home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei National Rail (VNR)&lt;/strong&gt; has a straightforward scheme for the names of its trains. Each is given a regional name — usually a flower or moss, the most important plants in Upen — and then the year is appended. This here is a Lesvesn 59-Series, since it entered production with Arisdeh Coachworks in 2059. Its bright orange livery (VNR Orange, specifically) means it’s a regional train — local trains have unique colours voted on by their passengers. The Lesvesn 59-Series is a DC electric multiple unit train type used all over Vekllei, most commonly on quiet semi-express routes, since the trains most often appear in two-car or even single unit configurations. Its bigger cousin, the Mustard 56-Series, is often seen in the cities. It looks more or less the same, but is a little wider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei National Rail&lt;/strong&gt;, or VNR, is one of those organisations caught somewhere between a faceless government enterprise and a family member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every Vekllei person rides a train each day, and that train is operated by VNR, which has a monopoly on rail travel and operation. Very few people know exactly what ‘VNR’ is. Is it a government department? A state-owned company? Or is it a “bureau” — the Vekllei word for a collection of companies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry about it. Someone Tzipora knew called it a state-owned, bureau-backed “organ” of Vekllei, and that was enough for her. Someone in the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; wrote a column the other day about horror films failing to capture sales in Vekllei. And why should they, Tzipora thought, when their lives are already a horror? Ask anyone how the Vekllei economy works and watch real terror reveal itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VNR runs the trains, and employs about 60,000 people in its operations, which range from locomotive engineers to copy editors for rail enthusiast periodicals. The privately-run, state-owned, bureau-backed sub-organ of the Transport Requisite of the Vekllei Government known as VNR maintains a fleet of rolling stock across a variety of types and track gauges, including steam locomotives and experiments in nuclear-electric maglevs. All of this bankrolled carelessly through the &lt;strong&gt;National Rail Insurance Scheme A.r.R.&lt;/strong&gt;, which prints as many labour-backed government White Bonds as VNR can spend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people illustrated here are VNR Attendants, professional people-pushers and friends of the rail-travelling public, who work on trains and platforms guiding, managing and assisting people. In Vekllei, most public-facing work is performed by the elderly, conscripted or socially-inclined. Although VNR has existed since independence, and is more or less the ancestor of the prewar Junta rail monopoly in floral-period makeup, its uniforms were overhauled in celebration of “250 years of rail” in 2055. Their jackets display Vekllei’s optimism in the future of plastic-based fabrics in fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most work in Vekllei, their appearance is professional but their manner is informal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What are you doing there?” Who, me? “Yeah, this is your line mate. Yellow, just keep following yellow, all right?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their shifts are short, but platform work is boring. Most trade shifts to get as much time on the trains as they can, where they can enjoy Vekllei’s exquisite scenery from some of the world’s finest public transport.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gold Sappers</title>

  Archived from the original article here
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/posts/2020-07-08-police/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venopor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Fedecenoayan porits&lt;/em&gt;, lit. Police of the Parliament) are Vekllei’s special police branch. They occupy a function somewhere between special policing and the paramilitary, linking Vekllei’s treasured infrastructure with its civilian police (“Cosmopor”), armed forces, and shadowy intelligence networks. Though they fulfil police functions today, their history is with the Royal Guards and Federal Police of yesteryear, which in turn has produced unusual units like the &lt;strong&gt;Gold Sappers&lt;/strong&gt;, which are unique in modern policing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold Sappers are the official police/security detachment of the National Mint of Vekllei. Contrary to popular belief, &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/posts/2020-06-24-crown/&#34;&gt;Vekllei does in fact mint coinage&lt;/a&gt;, but the Mint is also responsible for the production of paper “Government Crowns” (i.e. labour-backed government bonds) and Vekllei’s gold bullion reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Vekllei may not use money domestically, it spends and receives huge quantities of cash through the International Market in trade with other countries. In many cases, trade is made via gold bullion, which still backs the Vekllei Crown (not the Government Crown — &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/#economy&#34;&gt;click here if you’re confused&lt;/a&gt;). Although this gold is often simply moved around a vault in foreign reserves, like the Euro Bullion Exchange or Fort Knox, there are many cases where gold is moved into, out of, and around Vekllei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what the Gold Sappers are deployed to protect — Vekllei’s national wealth, in and out of transit. Their name and appearance date back to the colonial Atlantic Junta, when their historical units were deployed to pillage and steal from vulnerable infrastructure amidst war. In Vekllei’s convoluted military history, these unceremonious and criminal units were at some point folded into the Junta’s Royal Guards, then Federal Police, and now exist within the postwar Floral Period &lt;em&gt;Venopor&lt;/em&gt;. In typical fashion for Vekllei, the Gold Sappers are no longer sappers, nor are they a part of the military. Remember, we are discussing a country in which the &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/society/mail/#structure&#34;&gt;postal service is a military organ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the Venopor Gold Sappers retain the beards of their ancestral units, and preserve parts of their heritage through their ceremonial parade dress and traditional songs. In this image we can see illustrated two Sappers in both civilian and paramilitary dress. The redhead holds a submachine gun equipped with drum magazines, which are unusual but commonly used in security units to achieve initial fire superiority and suppress, which allows for repositioning and backup in convoy environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their vehicle is a R.V. Z-type (a military 4WD chassis used in all sorts of configurations) powered by a high-torque electric motor and charged by supercapacitors. That snorkel is for cooling, not exhaust. The Mint Z-type (called a ZMi-1 or -2) are used as escort cars in ground convoys, with bullion protected in armoured trucks. The Mint also has a train, and, in more common use, armoured helijets and jet planes. Gold Sappers accompany their gold and coins every step of the way. Otherwise, its navy livery is indicative of its authority as a &lt;em&gt;Venopor&lt;/em&gt; police wagon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold Sappers stand out — beards are prohibited across every other armed branch except the spooks and sappers. If you see a Mint convoy coming, stand well back and let it pass — for a country without money, they take their coins seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A woman has so many parts to her body, life is very hard indeed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;strong&gt;Lu Xun&lt;/strong&gt;, 1927&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even from my point of view, as a woman, there is nothing attractive about such &amp;lsquo;backward elements.&amp;rsquo; Their skin is beginning to wrinkle, their hair is growing thin, and fatigue is robbing them of their last traces of attractiveness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;strong&gt;Ding Ling&lt;/strong&gt; on the long-marcher woman soldiers, 1942&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Tzipora first arrived in Vekllei in 2063&lt;/strong&gt;, she was traumatised by the foreignness of everything. It was not just that they drove on the wrong side of the road, or that the chocolate was made by someone else, but that her whole understanding of the world — the world she’d been raised in all her life — was unravelled within weeks. It did not matter if you learned the language, or dressed like them, or worked with them — the way a Vekllei person thinks seemed totally alien, as though they were tuned into a frequency that she couldn’t hear. That was very difficult for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her clearest memory, out of all the emotional turmoil in her first few weeks, was the clothes. Tzipora was not fashionable or materialistic, but she’d never had nice things to wear. In Vekllei the things on the rack were simple, and often second-hand, but they were very well made and the department stores had a big variety. She picked out five shirts, nearly identical, and decided that these would be what she would wear from now on — it was her own way of establishing an identity; SHE IS THE GIRL WHO WEARS THIS TYPE OF SHIRT. Little things like that mattered a lot, because Tzipora was treated differently here. She was both ‘young’ and a ‘girl’, which had implications for how overseas people talked to her and how she was regarded. Here, almost no one seemed to notice. She had dignity by default, which was exciting and scary at the same time, so she needed something other than her appearance to claim as ‘hers’. And at that time, it was the shirt with the pleats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei is a place that is very much radical&lt;/strong&gt; but, either intentionally or as a byproduct of its opaque culture, suppresses the &lt;em&gt;appearance&lt;/em&gt; of radicalism in its public affairs (or as they say there, ‘sun-facing space’). This is for a few reasons. First, Vekllei uses its obscurity as a weapon against its continental neighbours, who might pull it into geopolitical tensions it wants no part of. The second is that Vekllei’s failed revolutionary movements of the early 20th Century are buried with the Junta that suppressed them. The third, and most critically, is that Vekllei people themselves are unaware of just how saturated their lives are with the cultural and political ideology of the floral period, which makes “foreign” political thinking difficult and results in a lot of empty rhetoric — for example, “petticoat socialism” describes the Bureau System, which does not have much to do with either petticoats or continental socialism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paradigm makes more sense when you consider that there are really two Veklleis — the one that existed before the Atomic War, and the one that exists now, called the “Floral Period” or sometimes “Petticoat Society”. The one that existed before has little resemblance to the one that exists now, and that is the way people have continued to think in the decades of independence — anything prior to 2015 is, simply, history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake — Vekllei is tremendously radical in its culture and politics, which it tempers with conservative names and third-way politicking. Today’s post looks at how the Vekllei woman changed in the years between 2005 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not unlike revolutions of years past, postwar Vekllei had (for the moment, at least) lost many of its structural oppressors of women, since the structure itself had collapsed quickly. The interim government had taken an orthodox, though contrarian, communist position, which ushered a new handbook of rhetoric towards de-objectification of women and their pragmatic and social value in the workforce. The interim government had several key women figures among it, who are credited with its success in this critical, and rapidly changing period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Vekllei socialist (&lt;em&gt;socialisme oa Vekllei&lt;/em&gt;) line of thinking, there are two points of attack. There was the suppression of old models of feminine beauty, which argued against women’s independence and dignity in favour of their security with men, who made up Vekllei’s economic and social caste throughout the entirety of the Junta’s rule. But there was also a very real fear that women’s liberation by Western metrics would simply evolve indentured living into a more obtuse, and in some ways more sinister, commodity-woman (&lt;em&gt;cosmavisiousnesh&lt;/em&gt;, lit. ‘plastic woman’&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;), who was free to educate herself but found her appearance subjected to permanent scrutiny — a product for a consumer, dependent on shifting fashions and complex social constellations still fundamentally controlled by men. This fear was not unfounded, as many educated women of the interim government (who made up nearly half of its members) had spent significant time in Western Europe and the United States, and were keenly aware of who was “gazing” (&lt;em&gt;lismious&lt;/em&gt;) and who was being “gazed at” (&lt;em&gt;visimett&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution developed by the interim government was both political and spiritual, designed to demolish the external remnants of Vekllei’s pre-war and highly stratified society, and the looming threats of foreign investment, new wealth, and an import of the modern commodity-woman. Most importantly, it understood that present notions of empowerment or disempowerment were problematic unto themselves — whether it was sexual liberation, modesty, or indeed the economic role of women in abstract — their ability to empower was still fundamentally chained to old society, which was still dominated by the sexist cultural default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Cisma de Diviousmesn, First Secretary of the War Recovery Committee, described the problem as such in The &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are nearing a precipice that all Vekllei women may fall into, should we follow unblinkingly the Visis Plan [postwar redevelopment plan], and allow foreign investment to replace English colonial governor-generals; we should be wise enough, so to speak, to not trade a king for a master and call it recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Upen&lt;/em&gt;’s discourse on womanhood, the essential virtues of a woman have always included good words, good work and good fortune — emphasising the role of women as both an alias for success/wealth and also as responsible for that fortune themselves, either in the workplace or through their innate spirituality. This has remained true throughout much of Vekllei’s history, but was obfuscated by the economic masculinity of Vekllei’s protectionist mercantile period. After the war, Upen saw a revival that would culminate in the spiritual fever of the late 2010s and early 2020s. The interim government co-opted this surge pragmatically, encouraging a shift in local perceptions of womanhood through spiritual, rather than political or ideological, methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a New Age,” the posters said. “So become a New-Age Woman.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming a New Age Woman involved two things — tearing down the external oppressions of the old and interim periods (harassment, domestic violence, and male interference in the affairs of women), and the interrogation of internalised sexisms (empowerment by male opinion [this included styles women found attractive, as inherited from men], abolishment of economic preoccupations, and the reconstruction of womanhood in abstract). This individual struggle was supported by the many social programmes developed by the interim government, with names like “economic feminisation” (abolishment of the male economic burden) and “abolishment of self-beautification for your man” (&lt;em&gt;scisimionze&lt;/em&gt;, or “self-adornment/self-beautification”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point was not to empower women by simply displacing men from male economic and social constructions — a move that was seen as disempowering because of who was setting those priorities —  but to rebuild Vekllei’s domestic understanding of “the woman” by the terms of women, legitimised by the authority of the interim government and the powerful cultural force Upen continues to have on society. Within such a culture, it was reasoned, women would be free to choose what womanhood meant to them, since it was not simply reactive to a sexist cultural default. The sum of this effort was called ‘sun-facing,’ or &lt;em&gt;semoisnesne&lt;/em&gt;, which referred to the progressive attitude of both the individual and the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Vekllei’s New Age Woman had dramatic effects and benefitted the status of women in Vekllei society tremendously, it was nonetheless fundamentally political and had obscure and surprising cultural artefacts buried within. The idea that a woman would be “free to choose” her own womanhood was a little misleading, since the interim government was rapidly developing its plan for “petticoat society,” in which Sundress Municipalism, the Bureau System and Floral Aestheticism would become such powerful cultural forces that no man nor woman would be able to escape them entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the wealth of the country grew and then exploded in the transition to Vekllei’s floral society, it was clear how the structure of petticoat society continued to influence women in Vekllei. Women can wear whatever they like — but simplicity and subtle self-decoration are common and encouraged by the uniforms system and floral aesthetics. Women can live however they like — but education is compulsory in childhood and highly valued, and young women are encouraged to fulfil ‘the female inclination for leadership’ inherited from Upen’s mother-metaphysics. And women can date whomever they like — though ideological compatibility, and not appearance, is encouraged in the &lt;em&gt;semoisnesne&lt;/em&gt; attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these things are easily argued as good — few would assume there are many feminists in the world who argue against the education of women — but they do betray the notion of truly “free” choice, insofar as Vekllei society is dominated by the economic and spiritual values of its structure. Vekllei considers capitalist economics, exponential growth, and gross historicism to be “masculine” — of course that sort of language trickles down into the social aspects of society. More directly, it prioritises form, colour, and purity in aesthetics — of course that aesthetic ideology affects how people dress, and contributes to its uniformed culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to place where the state begins and ends in Vekllei, which is how it can be argued for as an unfree and anarchic society simultaneously. So too is it difficult to determine how much of Vekllei culture originates in the centres of power in Vekllei — either political or religious — and subsequently there are problems in clarifying how women are affected by power, especially since women participate and in some cases dominate those hierarchies. Are they externalised, or internalised? Who is gazing at who?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of Vekllei’s cultural obscurity, which affects much more than politics and many people other than women, it is clear a dramatic and liberating shift occurred in Vekllei’s interim period of independence, and that shift has contributed tremendously to the status of contemporary Vekllei women, who enjoy economic and social freedoms that were unimaginable just decades prior. Even though Vekllei has not embraced political iconography to celebrate their indigenous feminism, we can see just how radical and wide-ranging the changes made were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/eyri&#34;&gt;Eyri&lt;/a&gt;, the bones of an ancient beast warp and groan in the sun&lt;/strong&gt;, red skin glinting in the whitecap churn of the shallows, oxidising, broken, ripped open by the sea. Everyone in the North of Vekllei knows about it. Mysteries abound. Even in our atomic century, the humans of Vekllei are enamoured with and terrified by the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Winter of 2018, just three years into Vekllei’s shaky, indigent independence, the TransNorth Oil Company purchased a submarine icebreaker called &lt;em&gt;Sea Serpent&lt;/em&gt; from U.S. Oil. It was a crock of shit, built in the late ‘80s to move crude through the Arctic in the difficult seasons. Submarine icebreakers were among the ugliest boats ever made, with thin necks that cut through ice and a warty conn crown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not unusual for no-name oil companies to buy up old shipping stock, but TransNorth was something else. If you tracked its company address, you came to a dilapidated warehouse in Memphis with signage affixed — totally deserted. It appears, following the paperwork, no one at all had purchased the &lt;em&gt;Sea Serpent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two months after its sale, an unregistered vessel by chance triggered a decades-old Soviet detection buoy near Vekllei’s EEZ. The Common Interest Watchhawk programme, designed to demilitarise the Arctic after the Atomic War, allowed the Soviets to report the event to Vekllei and the U.K. — perhaps suspicious it was a clandestine U.S. nuclear sub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in a command room of Vekllei’s fledgeling secret service (back then called the Office of National Intelligence, the predecessor to HO/NI), a siren fired off. Sixty minutes later, a military helijet touched down in Basa, a northern military office. A destroyer left port in Montre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buoy was working correctly, and the quiet hum of commercial submarine tech was tracked for eight hours, all the way to Vekllei’s territorial waters. There, the mystery vessel was radioed, radioed again, and destroyed. There was no tolerance for smugglers or spooks in postwar Vekllei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty minutes after depth charges boomed in the North Sea, the &lt;em&gt;Sea Serpent&lt;/em&gt; ran aground on an isolated beach in Eyri. It pushed itself right into the shallows, slashing its coolant pipes on the rocks as it capsized into the beach. With ionised radiation glowing faintly in the water, naval commandos stormed the conning tower, now on its side. Radio equipment, maps, chairs — it had all been flung across the dim interior in its capsizing. Inside were eight men in plain clothes, all dead. All were shot — one self-inflicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not until fifty years later, during the Dallas Crisis and the secession of the Dallas States, that some sort of clue as to the lair of the &lt;em&gt;Sea Serpent&lt;/em&gt; emerged. As negotiations dragged on for the Dallas lend-lease of U.S. government properties and infrastructure, a building owned by the Chroma Industrial Concern, a Floridian company subsidised by Washington, was included in a trade of some 614 assets leaked to AB/NI. A young AB/NI asset named Baron Desmoisnes, part of the team filing the leaks, followed up and found Chroma had a warehouse in Memphis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears the &lt;em&gt;Sea Serpent&lt;/em&gt; was coming for Vekllei — who says snakes don’t commit suicide?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint red&#34;&gt;
  ❖ &lt;strong&gt;This article&lt;/strong&gt; was part of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ocean Month&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in March 2021
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome again to Ocean Month. If you have questions, just ask.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When we say “&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,”&lt;/strong&gt; we most often think of the &lt;em&gt;Home Island&lt;/em&gt;, the city-state to which the country owes its name. In practice, however, the state of Vekllei is portioned between many far-flung corners of the Atlantic Ocean. From tropical jungles and dry wine-making country to mossy woodlands and arctic deserts, “Vekllei” as a singular concept is obfuscated by its diversity of land and people, and better represents a coalition of disparate Atlantic states than a single, centralised city-state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake, however — the power is held in the &lt;em&gt;Home Island&lt;/em&gt;, where the vast majority of Vekllei’s people live and work. Her autonomous, satellite regions are indulged and supported as any borough of the &lt;em&gt;Home Island&lt;/em&gt;, but these islands (and they are, invariably, islands) are often small, isolated and of little economic value. What makes them special is that they are populated with vibrant, unique peoples and cultures of considerable history, and are retained for precisely that fact — their cultural benefit for a city-state that considers itself a representative of indigenous Atlantic people; a “third power” between the hegemonies of Europe and America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This map depicts these places — “overseas territories” is what Vekllei calls them — as well as their exclusive economic zones (EEZs), outlined in white. Let’s take the opportunity to have a brief look at some of Vekllei’s most unique and distant regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kala&lt;/strong&gt;, or Greenland, is Vekllei’s “sister land”. Many of the indigenous Arctic people who first settled Vekllei nearly six thousand years ago crossed from or lived in &lt;em&gt;Kala&lt;/em&gt;. The massive glacial island is self-governing, and has its own regional parliament, but is otherwise a possession of Vekllei. Its largest city, &lt;em&gt;Nusc&lt;/em&gt;, reveals just how antagonist &lt;em&gt;Kala&lt;/em&gt; remains towards it inhabitants — just 250,000 people live there, compared to nearly 2.4 millions in Vekllei’s largest borough, &lt;em&gt;Vekllei Proper&lt;/em&gt;. Pack a jacket!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demon&lt;/strong&gt;, or Jan Mayen, is a tiny volcanic satellite island and full overseas territory of Vekllei. It has the smallest population of any overseas province, at just 15,600 people, who live in its only town — &lt;em&gt;Skismi&lt;/em&gt;. As an overseas territory, it receives daily postal service and full entitlements of any Vekllei person, mostly by way of flying boats and hydrofoils.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aismious Isles&lt;/strong&gt;, or the Faroe Islands, are an archipelago of charming people mostly descended from Arctic Vekllei (indigenous Algic people) and early Irish settlers, known for their seafood diets and provinciality. There’s a lot going on in the world, and the people of the Aismious Isles don’t want to know about it — or at least, that’s the consensus. For this reason, it’s popular as the “thinking man’s retreat” from society, as opposed to traditional holiday locales like the Azores.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaking of the Azores&lt;/strong&gt;, these islands are unique — while self-governing, they are structured more like a &lt;em&gt;Bureau&lt;/em&gt; than a democracy. Two governments exist there at once — the &lt;em&gt;Azores Holiday Government&lt;/em&gt;, which maintains infrastructure that enables nearly a million Vekllei people to vacation there each year, and the &lt;em&gt;Mira Regional Council&lt;/em&gt;, its neighbour and electorate to which locals cast their ballots. This has, historically, made them very cranky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mira&lt;/strong&gt;, or Madeira, is situated off the coast of Africa and is one of the few places in Vekllei that requires special permits to visit. It is both heavily protected as a wildlife reserve and a major naval port for the Royal Vekllei Armed Forces at &lt;em&gt;Sumi&lt;/em&gt;, its largest city. As is encouraged throughout Vekllei, people here live the way they have for hundreds of years, just more quietly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kalina Isles&lt;/strong&gt;, made up of many islands of the Lesser Antilles, are a tropical archipelago of hundreds of small islands, many of which are unpopulated. Like &lt;em&gt;Kala&lt;/em&gt;, the Kalina Isles are self-governing, and while its old colonial towns and indigenous Caribbean culture may not at first appear “Vekllei”, you’ll find their relaxed lifestyles and deep appreciation for landscape unite them in spirit with all Vekllei territories, from the Home Island to Demon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei Antarctic Territories&lt;/strong&gt; are, somehow, more isolated in feeling than her Lunar cities. During the late 2050s, when sovereignty started to be enforced in the antarctic, Vekllei retained its claim by encouraging domestic tourism to the South Pole. On the coast, an airport services a civilian city called Desma of hotels and commerce, which is marked by the dramatic, hostile desert that surrounds it. The further inland you go, the less accessible the settlements become, finally arriving at the military/scientific Polar Station at the South Pole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei Lunar Territories&lt;/strong&gt; are, through the miracle of our current age, accessible to the average Vekllei person. This fact is one of the great sources of pride Vekllei people feel toward their country, and many visit at least once. Moidonnet, or “Moon City”, is one of only a handful of lunar settlements open to the public, and is unique in its accessibility to the people of its home country. Some 45,000 people live there semi-permanently, taking calcium pills to keep their bones healthy, under the large glass domes of the city. Many more visit — and are left with the memories of a lifetime, and the humbling experience of gazing upon our small blue planet from above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear, then, that Vekllei’s conceptual and political bias towards its northern territories is misleading, since — at least domestically — isolation and island living is a foundational aspect of how Vekllei people understand themselves. Although someone from Mira might at first be a novelty to a person of the Home Islands, it very soon becomes apparent that Mira is, in fact, Vekllei — its weather might be warmer, and its people might look different, but their lives are very similar, premised on gentle living and Vekllei’s complex metaphysics of landscape. That is what it means to be “Vekllei,” no matter where you are in the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

  Archived from the original article here
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint red&#34;&gt;
  ❖ &lt;strong&gt;This article&lt;/strong&gt; was part of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ocean Month&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in March 2021
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint blue&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;❖ Note from the Editor&lt;/strong&gt;
Although vessels described here are written with female pronouns as per Western convention, Vekllei traditionally uses male pronouns for navy vessels.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nuclear Heavy Battlecruiser V.V.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lava&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is the first of the Lava-class cruisers, the largest of Vekllei’s surface warships. Vekllei doctrine does not typically float cruisers with fleets, and so the &lt;em&gt;Lava&lt;/em&gt; often operates independently, outfitted for a variety of roles. She can be sailed into any storm-ravaged port and hook up to the local electric grid, powering tens of thousands of homes with her enormous molten salt fission reactor. She is equipped for both fire support and assault. 5 large guns of 50-100mm calibers crater the shore as missiles, torpedoes and lasers of various types fight off threats from the air and sea. She is even equipped for beach assaults and boarding, with 6 assault boats and 5 helijets available to offload hundreds of maritime commandos, which are deployed frequently in Vekllei’s ongoing fight against illegal fishing. Her multipurpose mission is reflected in the visibility of her superstructure, which boasts heliports, vertical launch systems, rack missiles, and heavy guns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, she enters the world’s largest marine railway in the port town of Cisadra. As she sits in the water here, her sailors have disembarked and her helijets are preparing to relocate as thousands of tons of ballast is pumped into a treatment facility. Once her weight is reduced to a mere 25,000 tonnes, she will be chained to the massive marine railway ‘cradle’ — the supports and bed on which she sits — and slowly pulled by massive nuclear winches into the shallow water of the Cisadra Shipyards, a naval facility owned by the Royal Vekllei Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This marine railway is the largest of its kind, and was unfathomably expensive to build. The Navy of Vekllei maintains a naval station in the Lesser Antilles to support strategic nuclear sites it retains on the Kalina Islands, and large-scale dredging and dock construction was deemed unsuitable for the sorts of harbours common to the area. Although a number of ideas, including a floating shipyard were hypothesised, the Cisadra Marine Railway was built after the success Vekllei had with similar systems in the Home Islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read on for a little more information on the Kalina Islands.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Kalina Islands&lt;/strong&gt; (made up of &lt;em&gt;Anguilla&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;St Martin, St Kitts &amp;amp; Nevis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Montserrat&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Antigua&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Barbuda&lt;/em&gt;) are an autonomous overseas territory of &lt;strong&gt;Vekllei&lt;/strong&gt;, structured as a self-managing dependent state similar to &lt;strong&gt;Kala&lt;/strong&gt; (Greenland) and the &lt;strong&gt;Aismious&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Islands&lt;/strong&gt; (Faroe). Although their origins are colonial, today they are a full overseas state of Vekllei with the same entitlements and voting rights as any Home Islands &lt;em&gt;Borough&lt;/em&gt;. They remain autonomous in internal policy, similar to a provincial government, and across their hundreds of tropical islands there are some 350,000 people, all of them holding both Vekllei and Kalina citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kalina Islands were purchased from the Spanish in the 17th century, and indicated Vekllei’s initial intention to exploit the New World. This ambition was scuppered with the collapse of the Vekllei monarchy, which established forts across them but could not muster the resources to occupy continental America. Vekllei’s colonial efforts were blunted for centuries after, and excluded the country from major participation in the slave trade and the colonisation of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leaves the Kalina Islands, named after its native peoples, in a peculiar position as both a legacy of the early colonial period while also remaining home to the only major populations of Island Carib people (&lt;em&gt;Kalinago&lt;/em&gt;) left in the world. On adjacent overseas territories, like the British Virgin Islands and Guadaloupe, they died out from murder and disease — but through the sheer failure of Vekllei’s colonial policy, they live on as an association of island territories in the 21st Century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being thousands of kilometres apart with dramatically different cultures and climates, both the Home and Kalina Islands remain “Vekllei” by way of their ancient cultures, maritime histories and moneyless bureau system. In this sense, the success and prosperity of the Kalina Islands reestablish what “Vekllei” is — where once it meant the indigenous people of the Arctic North, today it represents a coalition of Atlantic territories united in their dependence on landscape and economic systems. If the Kalina Islands were to become independent, it is likely little would change — their centuries of history with the Home Islands have cemented a desire for landscape sovereignty and postindustrial localism, and along with Kala and the Aismious, Vekllei has forged an alternative way of living for indigenous Atlantic peoples caught between the hungry machines of America and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caught amidst sunrays in early Autumn, things are good&lt;/strong&gt;. You could call almost anyone on the telephone these days. And if you wanted to see someone, why travel? A videophone was just as good. But just as the photograph failed to displace the painter, neither did the telephone or videophone succeed in killing the hand-written letter. There was something thoughtful about it. It was intimate, but also dependent on memory. Memories of people, memories of places. It was slower, yes, but that&amp;rsquo;s just how life worked in this country. It is a good way to live.&lt;/p&gt;

  Archived from the original article here
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint red&#34;&gt;
  ❖ &lt;strong&gt;This article&lt;/strong&gt; was part of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mail Week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in February 2021
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re going to do a deep dive on stamps today.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can tell a domestic Vekllei stamp from its international counterpart quite easily:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domestic stamps have a coloured square, called a &lt;em&gt;chromacode,&lt;/em&gt; used for sorting mail automatically within the country by a special machine called a &lt;em&gt;kinosemimatia&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domestic stamps do not show a price in &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/#5-economy&#34;&gt;Vekllei Kroner&lt;/a&gt;, and generally do not use the Vekllei hieroglyph to announce its origin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can deduce that the stamps pictured above are all &lt;em&gt;domestic&lt;/em&gt; stamps used for sending mail to other Vekllei people, regardless of whether they live in Antarctica, Vekllei’s lunar colonies or anywhere in-between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stamps are valuable records of their time, particularly as memories of celebration. You can learn a lot about a place and what it values by looking at its stamps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s take a look at some of Vekllei’s domestic postage stamps from the last few years. From the top left:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2063 marked the launch of the third generation of Vekllei rocket booster since independence in 2015. The introduction of these boosters, spaced evenly across the postwar decades, marked eras in themselves for Vekllei’s extraterrestrial ambitions. By the 2060s, most metals were mined off-world, marking one of the greatest weapons for peace in the atomic era — vast new worlds of untapped resources. This particular postage stamp was released as part of a set celebrating Vekllei rocketry, including recent expeditions to planetoids on the very periphery of our solar system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Puffins are the national bird and appear everywhere. You can see why — they’re pretty birds and very common in Vekllei. They are popularly circulated on stamps in a variety of styles simply because people like to see them when sending and receiving mail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This stamp may look abstract at first, but is actually a message in &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/language/#7-vekllei-semaphore&#34;&gt;Vekllei Semaphore&lt;/a&gt;. Green and gold represent nature and living blood, which alternated like this usually refers to natural chaos. But there’s more to it — this striping pattern, called a sunburst in Vekllei hieroglyphs, refers to the sun, and can mean warmth. These swooping white lines mean purity, or delicateness, and those patterned squares are used for the borders of announcements from the Prime Minister’s Office. So can you guess what this stamps says? It’s announcing Vekllei’s success in the Olympics in skiing, of course. Vekllei Semaphore is rarely straightforward — it has a thousand quirks built over a thousand years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of the Prime Minister’s Office, this is Ms. Prime Minister Jo Sismiosnah, one of two Prime Ministers in the country.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atomic weaponry is a fact of life in the 2060s, and Vekllei has a complex psychological relationship with nukes as both a victim and retainer of nuclear weapons. It is also the only country in the world to have detonated nuclear weapons for a &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/posts/2020-06-01-fission/&#34;&gt;cultural purpose&lt;/a&gt;. This stamp depicts such a detonation. In the absurdity of the Royal Mail Press, antinuclear stamps are also produced simultaneously, depicting white doves urging world leaders to denuclearise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This flower, called a Lava Rose, is common to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/images/railmap.jpg&#34;&gt;Lumiousniyah&lt;/a&gt; region on the West of the country. Not by coincidence, its chromacode is destined for Copette.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vekllei retains a great many nuclear icebreakers to keep shipping traffic moving in and out of its Northern regions. The country depends heavily on foreign shipping for its bizarre peripheral markets and such icebreakers are often celebrated on stamps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is Vekllei’s lovely agricultural belt throughout its rich volcanic interior, specifically based off Kyala’s wheat fields. By no coincidence, its chromacode is destined for Kyala.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, we see a celebration of Anglo-Vekllei relations in the post-occupation period. Although historical tensions will linger for many generations more, and disputes over fishing rights in the Atlantic continue to threaten friendly relations, Vekllei is very keen in a political context to celebrate the diplomatic successes achieved with the U.K. since occupation, and you’ll find the U.K. generally overrepresented on Vekllei’s ‘foreign’ domestic stamps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now that’s a lot of stamp facts!&lt;/strong&gt; Before we go, Tzipora has just a couple of words on starting your own stamp collection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEVER PEEL STAMPS&lt;/strong&gt;. Cut them off the envelope and soak it in water for an hour or so, until it separates freely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dry your stamps on a tea towel. Press them with books so they don’t curl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your stamps safe by keeping them in an album, preferably.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share your stamps. Stamps are meant to be shared, so never be afraid to trade your boring Vekllei stamps to some friendly Soviet or American for theirs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s all for now&lt;/strong&gt;. We’ve got one more post left in “Mail Week” (more like Mail Month at this rate), before we head off to something new. It’s going to be very exciting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Stamp Manufacturie of the Royal Mail Press&lt;/strong&gt;, located on 5th Avenue, churns millions of stamps a year out of its massive drum presses. Stamps are used on mail instead of postcodes, and as payment for the international and courier work the Royal Mail does abroad. Since Vekllei does not use money domestically, Vekllei people do not pay for postage and stamps are used in the automatic sorting system to determine the destination for any Vekllei territory, including its arctic, peripheral and antarctic possessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main factory, seen here, is an original &lt;em&gt;Newda&lt;/em&gt; building in the simple, postwar style common in the time it was built. The street and loading area it looks over is actually just one part of the Royal Mail headquarter complex, and the surrounding city blocks have slowly been claimed for the Mail’s singular mission: reliable post for Vekllei people, anywhere in the world. In the background, the Mail Tower, so it’s called, punctuates the mid-rise skyline of the Capital. The tower is actually a vestigial artefact of a military telecommunications facility, now home to the Mail’s Office of Telecommunications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At street level, pedestrians can take lunch at the Royal Mail Press Cafeteria, tour the Royal Vekllei Philatelic Museum, or take a monorail to the Royal Mail Post Office General, where the organisation is administrated. Like many State Requisite manufacturers, these facilities are available to the public via tours, which make common day trips for the unburdened Vekllei worker/holidaymaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a closer look at why the The First Post Office of the Royal Vekllei Mail looks the way it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei has throughout much of its history evolved outside of Western rationalism, and this incurs all sorts of peculiarities in its public life, not least of which its affection for the perceptual, affective, natural and other unsentimental artefacts of pre-rational thought. For Vekllei people, art is just the decoration of ordinary life. In architecture, this is catastrophic; buildings in Vekllei are not “projects,” and they have no “subject” that centres its design. This has resulted in the bizarre manifestation of a sort of postwar postmodernism, rooted in &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/religion/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Upen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and valorised by &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/posts/2020-10-11-metaphysic/&#34;&gt;Vekllei Metaphysics&lt;/a&gt;, in which informal poststructural utopianism is projected onto the objects — in this case, buildings and factories — of ordinary life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei modernism is basically utopian. Not utopian in the way this whole project is; as a peculiar expression of being — but utopian in its unabashed projection of texture and emotion in place of an authentic art-form. &lt;em&gt;Newda&lt;/em&gt; is utopian in the sense that buildings are not art-objects, and they serve a rational purpose agnostic to subjectivity. &lt;em&gt;Newda&lt;/em&gt; is also unsentimental, as art is merely the decoration of ordinary life in Vekllei, not dissimilar to language or cooking. It is obvious, then, that architecture and art have been separated intentionally in Vekllei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newda&lt;/em&gt; is the face of this cultural legacy, and despite its poststructural origins, is deeply modernist in appearance. It is styled in the instinct of the postwar period, as symbolic of recovery and wealth. It gives very little concern to imitation of past styles or structural gimmicks — it prioritises geometry, cleanliness, “the human face” (meaning original human construction; not biomimicry) and dependence on place. Although influenced by experiments in modernism in France and the United States, it is mostly indigenous and isolationist today, as the rest of the world rumbles amidst yet another crisis of architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

  Archived from the original article here
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint red&#34;&gt;
  ❖ &lt;strong&gt;This article&lt;/strong&gt; was part of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mail Week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in February 2021
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was the hottest day of June so far, in that time of year where the sun never set on Vekllei. It was the first week of sleepless nights; the windows thrown open, air sticky and pungent with the smells of the rainforests, tossing and turning in the heat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A stab of panic shot through her as she woke, bleary-eyed and senseless, to the quiet bedside clock. She blinked a couple of times before the terror set in. She’d overslept — 08:32 — but critically, the Travelling Post Office left at 8:30. Shit, shit shit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maybe, just maybe, she could run to the next station and catch it when it stopped to offload the grocer’s produce.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lying atop damp sheets, she rolled out of bed and made a racket on the wooden floor of her house, wiping her eyes as she looked for her friend’s package. She flew out the front door moments later in the shorts and tee shirt she’d slept in, raking a sandal across the gravel as she landed awkwardly. It was usually a fifteen minute walk to the station, so she ran as fast as she could, the package bouncing off her leg painfully as she took off down the drive. Warm raindrops started to hit the dirt around her.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As she rounded the corner where the dirt track met paved path, she met it — the No. 76 Mail Train, closing in from behind. The mist had rolled in and the hot rain was belting down. No. 76 was going to overtake her — but she still might catch it before it departed. This was going to be close.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mail Trains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;Rail Post Offices&lt;/strong&gt;, are a common sight in Vekllei once you leave the dense urban infrastructure of its coastal cities behind. The further you venture into Vekllei’s dramatic, tendril-like mountain ranges and igneous valleys, the smaller towns become. Some, like Montre-Lola, had their post offices closed long ago, and today are served by a series of travelling post offices that run along the ubiquitous web of commuter rail lines in the country. The advantages are obvious; one train, running along a single line, can service six or seven towns in a morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They pull into a siding, usually the platform of the local station in quiet towns, and wait for fifteen minutes or so to allow for the loading and unloading of mail. They can also perform duties of regular post offices, like the renewal of identification and travel booking, as long as you phone ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern Mail Trains are typically based on the Series 225 EMU in 2-car configurations. These are modern locomotives with electric motors in each car, allowing the 225 (known as the &lt;em&gt;RM Series&lt;/em&gt; in its Mail Train configuration) to easily run along Vekllei’s old interior rail lines, which have steep gradients and tight curves. The exception is the Siviouscopet de Desmisnion, or &lt;em&gt;Ambassador of the Postmistress&lt;/em&gt;, a special mail-sorting train based on the 6-car Series 4000 trainset that operates between the Capital and Montre. The &lt;em&gt;Ambassador&lt;/em&gt; is particularly special, since it houses a fully furnished office available to the Postmistress General for her use in running the Royal Vekllei Mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora here has encountered the simple adventures of rural living; navigating the friendly bureaucracy of her government from small towns long since forgotten in common memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint red&#34;&gt;
  ❖ &lt;strong&gt;This article&lt;/strong&gt; was part of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mail Week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in February 2021
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The M.S.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fairie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model 54-2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;“Mail Hopper” is a strange aircraft&lt;/strong&gt;. The basic design has remained unchanged for over a hundred years, imported from the United States way back during the massive scrapping of junk warplanes after the Second World War. Even back during the Junta years the country had little respect for foreign intellectual property, and by 1949 had started rolling out Imitation Catalinas, which were among the first indigenous aircraft in the country. A hundred years on, the Fairie is still being developed and produced, its most recent version rolling out in 2054.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government Aircraft Factories (the actual name of the organisation and design bureau is literally “Government Aircraft Manufacturie”) produce military aircraft for Vekllei’s armed forces. And since the Royal Mail is technically a military organisation, Mail vehicle contracts are furnished by the government arms merchants of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While keeping the same basic form and fuselage of the ancient Catalinas, the &lt;em&gt;Fairie&lt;/em&gt; has been thoroughly overhauled inside and out. The twin props have been replaced by low-power Sami &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/posts/2020-07-13-economy/&#34;&gt;S.p.M.&lt;/a&gt; electric pulse jets raised high off the seas to keep salt water out, which are angled slightly downwards. Though inefficient at the sorts of altitudes the &lt;em&gt;Fairie&lt;/em&gt; flies at, they are much quieter than turbofans and better suited for slow flying, benefitting the low-speed gliding tendencies of the aircraft. The aircraft is smaller overall than its predecessors, with a redesigned tail and wingspan that lower the &lt;em&gt;Fairie&lt;/em&gt;’s stall speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei has many islands, and more emerge all the time. This is a violently volcanic country after all, and after a day of churning seawater whole new landmasses can appear off the coast. The archipelago communities of these landmasses are often serviced by light flying boat aircraft like the &lt;em&gt;Fairie.&lt;/em&gt; Some of them, like this one here, are seaplanes exclusively and have no landing gear (the “-2” of its designation refers to this omission). Others, especially those assigned to the arctic, are equipped with skis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mail retains fourteen &lt;em&gt;Fairies&lt;/em&gt; across the Home Islands, and a further six across the Azores, Aismious (Faroe Islands) and Kala (Greenland). To the people they service, these planes represent much more than the arrival of the mail — they are a direct gesture of the mother Vekllei state; a reminder they are not forgotten by the Crown Metropole, and a pipeline to friends and relatives across oceans. These pilots are among the luckiest in the world, flying superbly engineered aircraft, refined over a century, across some of the most striking lands and oceans on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus: &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/posts/2019-12-12-jet/&#34;&gt;a much larger Vekllei aircraft built by the Comen Aeroyards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint red&#34;&gt;
  ❖ &lt;strong&gt;This article&lt;/strong&gt; was part of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mail Week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in February 2021
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here we have arranged the highest-ranking and lowest-ranking members&lt;/strong&gt; of the Royal Vekllei Mail (Mail A.r.). On the left is an Office Postgirl, a precursory position tasked with distributing letters in the sprawling bureau complexes abundant in the centralised postwar period. This particular employee is Aleja Hernández, who has decided she’d rather deliver mail than spend another year studying for high school exit exams. Mail runs in her blood — her father, a Dominican, is stationed abroad in service of the Royal Mail’s Cuba Office with her mother, a native of the country. They’ll be abroad until the Spring, and by the time they get back they expect Aleja to have found full-time work with the Mail. She wears a baggy smock to keep ink and dirt off her uniform. Here, she represents a common intern of the organisation, tasked with menial and uninteresting work for a few weeks as she’s trained to be a proper Postwoman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between someone like Aleja and the Acting General Postmistress is the Postmistress does not spill letters all over the hallway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current General Postmistress of the country is Sious Desmesneh, who stands here beside Aleja. At 32, she is the youngest Postmistress in Vekllei’s history. She is also among the most cunningly ambitious people currently employed by the Mail, and scandalously usurped her immediate superiors to inherit the role after the passing of Postmaster John Iousasmor, a shock promotion formalised by a landslide company ballot in May last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is only appropriate that she ascended via coup, since the Postmaster General is a &lt;em&gt;de jure&lt;/em&gt; military rank, equivalent to an Admiral in the navy. The Mail is a State Requisite, not a military organ, but it retains a formal military leadership and ranked hierarchy from its origins as a military communications organ many centuries ago. Although a military “General,” Sious has no actual military powers and serves less exotically as a &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; director of the Mail A.r. She wears the Postmistress’s uniform, complete with traditional Vekllei &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/posts/2020-01-11-dress/&#34;&gt;floral plate&lt;/a&gt; and round &lt;em&gt;heismious&lt;/em&gt; hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the flag of the Royal Mail is depicted above Aleja. Most bureau-sized organisations in Vekllei have their own flags, as part of &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/language/#7-vekllei-semaphore&#34;&gt;Vekllei semaphore&lt;/a&gt;, and the Mail Flag is flown alongside the domestic and regional standards outside every post office in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint red&#34;&gt;
  ❖ &lt;strong&gt;This article&lt;/strong&gt; was part of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mail Week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in February 2021
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are not many postal services older than the Royal Vekllei Mail&lt;/strong&gt;. It is so old that in the Vekllei language its title is simply ‘Mail’ — the ‘Royal’ and ‘Vekllei’ are implied by the use of its hieroglyph. Founded in 1422 as part of the military communications system between government and mercantile government holdings, it has survived various restructurings — and several wars — to remain a critical communications and cultural institution today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is the usual way with State Requisites (A.r.), the (Royal Vekllei) Mail maintains a state monopoly on all paper and electric mail in the country, serviced by a workforce of nearly fifty thousand people and two hundred thousand &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/posts/2021-01-11-automen/&#34;&gt;automen&lt;/a&gt;. Peculiarly, telephones, telegrams and videophones are structured under the Mail as the Mail Bureau Office of Telecommunications, which acts as an independent organ of the Mail A.r.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei people send nearly 12 million letters a day — that’s about one for every two people, and the Mail processes and delivers another 40 million mail pieces a day. It does this with a fleet of jets, automatic trucks, dedicated mail trains, intercity pneumatic systems, vehicle automen, and postmen, all wearing the red and gold colours of the organisation. It previously served the King of Vekllei, during the years of monarchy, and today serves the Royal (Land) Sovereign — the confusing name for the landscape of Vekllei and its potential for human use. It is &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; bound by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/#floral-society&#34;&gt;Petticoat constitution of the Floral Period.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei people love their Mail, as a patriotic analogy for the unity of the city-state. Red postboxes are visible on every street in city boroughs, and in the country Post Offices serve as critical contact points for communities isolated from urban business. The announcing of the Mail’s Postmaster General is a deeply ceremonial affair, second only to the ascension of new Prime Ministers. Vekllei was home to the world’s first Postmistress General, Mi Miou, in 2016 shortly after independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is only appropriate that the Universal Postal Union, the U.N. body responsible for the worldwide mail treaty coordinating international postage, is headquartered in Vekllei’s Capital district, two blocks away from the Mail’s luxurious &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/posts/2019-12-20-apartment/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newda&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; head post office and administration complex. As one of the oldest of Vekllei’s ancient, evolving state institutions it perhaps best symbolises the age and service of the Vekllei state to its people.&lt;/p&gt;

  Archived from the original article here
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Vekllei word for a robot is&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;automasiosn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, or ‘automan’. When we talk about Vekllei being a “post-scarcity society,” it is by automen through which it happens. They are found across the entire country in all types of hard and boring work, forever dutiful, forever mindless. It is not that the robot has replaced the human worker, since &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/#employment&#34;&gt;about 90%&lt;/a&gt; of Vekllei people are employed. Instead, the automan takes its place in the necessary evils of industrial society, fulfilling the wildest fantasies of utopian industrialists; the factory is no longer just the place of the machine, it is in fact a machine itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talk about Vekllei “deindustrialising,” it is by automen through which it happens. They are neither alive nor entirely synthetic, and work to maintain the basic comforts of consumer society in secret, as the Vekllei state moves towards total deregulation of the human life experience. The more they produce, the further Vekllei people are pushed away from modernity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automen better resemble automatic machines than a synthetic person; the vast majority of them are bespoke products integrated into infrastructure for a specific purpose. Some are hidden in plain sight — the automatic train control, the system which closes and cleans public lavatories, and telephone switchboards are all operated by automen. They don’t think like a human does, because they are manufactured, not born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activity of the robot brain, called mind-genesis, emerges from artificial substrates of crystal (called command clocks) linked by vat-grown brain tissue, which organically process commands delivered by a computer. Most commands for a robot are sensory, and utilise the brain’s natural instinct for balance and orientation in processing. Most robot brains in Vekllei are completely engineered, but are based on mapped sections of ape brains and grown in pluripotent stem cell vats in an immersion fluid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Command clocks are produced in superheated ovens that are then submerged in an ionised liquid. These wafers, called “cookies”, are manufactured out of tetrachalcogenic materials that support “cartographic” (as opposed to “chaotic”) crystal pathways. Early robots used tridymite, which occurs naturally in Vekllei, but almost all robots today use synthetic crystal (usually quartz) grown in hydrothermal crystal plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tissue and command clocks are knitted together in what is basically an incredibly precise and expensive sewing machine, connecting the command clocks to their electrical components and the clocks to the living tissue by way of an axon gun. The result is a device with instincts, dumb and unthinking but highly sensitive and adaptive to inputs. When coupled with other modules, like sensor lasers, automen are able to navigate independently of programmed instruction sets. Since most of their programming and memory are offloaded, they are also relatively inexpensive compared to early overseas models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very few automen in Vekllei are functionally independent, since robotic independence requires complex and expensive command processing computational and control units. Since the vast majority of automen operate in logistics or manufacturing industries, they are usually slaved to a facility Master Computer, which offloads most processing. In the case of maintenance and infrastructure, Master Computers may be consolidated into a region-wide single supercomputer, called an Automatic Asset Command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This picture shows Tzipora socialising with a school maintenance robot, primarily used for vacuuming floors clean. It is connected to its Master Computer via cabling that runs in rails across the interior of the school, since radios are common enough here to interfere with communication between the automan and its computer. Behind her, a service automen used for crowd control, announcements and communication tells her to stop making friends with the maintenance droid. Incidents like these are common enough, and modern automens have security features to prevent vandalism and self-report damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final question remains — if Vekllei has entered post-scarcity using robots, why does the rest of the world not simply replicate them? The simple answer is that they do, and the synthetic automan was not invented in Vekllei — it was invented in Poland, and copied by West Germany. They are used world-over in manufacturing and industry. But Vekllei is unique in its heavy use of vehicle automen in public areas, for the simple fact that the economics of robotics just don’t make sense anywhere else in the world. Even in economies of scale, it is too expensive to grow a brain to replace human janitors, milkmen or refuse collectors. Automen demand enormous amounts of electricity, and require complex maintenance and special nutrient fuels to work. These expenses make sense in the contexts of sophisticated manufacturing, but don’t add up in unskilled work where they would be subject to vandalism and theft. In a world of dwindling resources and a rising tide of instability, the problem is much larger than a simple lack of automen or the fact that people must work — a limit has been reached, and robots as we currently understand them will always be more expensive than human life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei, in its soviet approach to science, sees these wonders of the atomic age wandering school halls, crushing shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The New Year in Vekllei rings out during its months of darkness and cold&lt;/strong&gt;. This calendar runs the regular affairs of the country, like it does the modern world. To Vekllei people, however, it is plain that New Years occurs not in darkness but instead in the summer solstice in June, the way it has for thousands of years in the dramatic cycles of light and dark in the country. In this sense, the end of December resonates among businesses and little else, much like the financial year elsewhere. An ancient pagan festival, one of twelve each year, takes its place in summer. This event is called &lt;em&gt;Rascismion&lt;/em&gt;, or “Rebirth of the Season” in the old Vekllei usage of the word — meaning the complete cycle of seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a spiritual artefact of &lt;em&gt;Upen&lt;/em&gt;, it is no surprise that the Solstice brings good luck and rebirth to Vekllei. It marks good fortune then, that the assembly and launch of the &lt;em&gt;Desg&lt;/em&gt; met the Solstice, launching for Jupiter’s Europa just before midnight on June 21st, 2064. Constructed by the &lt;em&gt;Solar Concern of the Vekllei Commonwealth Materials Bureau&lt;/em&gt; (or Solaburo) in cooperation with the &lt;em&gt;Rocket Navy of the Vekllei Commonwealth Armed Forces&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Cosmos Office&lt;/em&gt; (or Cosmoburo), the &lt;em&gt;Desg&lt;/em&gt; will land material on Europa to prepare for human arrival in six years. It is named after the Desg creatures of Vekllei mythology, who passed messages between malicious and benevolent factions of creatures before human settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it was nearly midnight, it was the Solstice and the sun would not set tonight. Ayn and Tzipora had spread out plates of Vekllei &lt;em&gt;Kimisosyo&lt;/em&gt; stew across a blanket just south of the Lita Cosmodrome to watch the launch. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/lita&#34;&gt;Royal Borough of Lita&lt;/a&gt; was not far from Copette (&lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/images/railmap.jpg&#34;&gt;map of Vekllei here&lt;/a&gt;), one of the Five Crown Boroughs of Vekllei, but this was Vekllei’s glacial interior and it felt a million miles from anywhere. Its geography was ancient and violent, strikingly barren and brutally volcanic. Why visit Europa? It was alien enough here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayn had brought her portable television. Baron was supposed to meet them there, but his train was delayed and he was stuck somewhere in &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/miyatvousi/&#34;&gt;Miyatvousi&lt;/a&gt; with the beer and fruit spritzers. Tzipora liked a drink, but Ayn liked it too much and had given it up years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I suppose it’s better than being drunk,” Tzipora said, nursing a fizzy drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, it’s not at all, Zelda… Getting drunk feels great, that’s why I got drunk,” Ayn said. She was watching some teen-agers cuddling further down the hill, and sighed after a moment. “That’s the trouble with it. A warm night like this, tired and with nothing to do? It’s the best feeling in the world. Let’s not kid ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I like wine,” Tzipora said stupidly before erring a moment later, embarrassed at how childish she sounded. “Well, you know. I drink alcohol, but not much. I like sweet things mostly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayn felt sorry for girl as the awkwardness of the conversation settled on Tzipora. It was worse to be self-aware, sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Baron likes a drink,” Tzipora continued. “He drinks a lot. He’s okay though, I don’t think he can get drunk. He’s a cool cucumber, he doesn’t change at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Is that right? Anyway, what time is it? It’ll be launching soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the minutes ticked closer to launch, Tzipora began to fret that Baron wouldn’t make it. The New Year was very important to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was out-of-breath and wrestling a crate of beer back under his arm as the distant boom of the atomic thrusters caught the mountaintops. He crested the hill as a dull roar invited the distant glitter of rocket engines that flickered out of the Lita Cosmodrome Launch Basin. He saw Ayn and Tzipora not far away and called to them, but they couldn’t hear him — the &lt;em&gt;Desg&lt;/em&gt; had called in the New Year, and all eyes were on it as it shined in the sky, brightest of all the stars. 2064 had became 2065, or Year 59 of the Floral Period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happy New Year!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a thousand years of history in Vekllei’s armed forces&lt;/strong&gt;, though you’ll find very little of it recalled casually today. Almost everything about Vekllei’s prewar society was scorched by the bombs, and the scraps of military infrastructure that survived were appropriated in the subsequent British occupation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since independence, a slate has been wiped clean, and a modern fighting force has replaced the colonial legions and battleships of yesteryear. Since reestablishment, Vekllei’s mettle has been tested in the jungles of Taiwan and the arctic deserts alike, and have proven themselves to be a rugged, versatile army of considerable bravery and fighting strength in spite of poor equipment in the bankruptcy of independence. Attached to British units in Taiwan and sent carelessly into dirty work, the Vekllei Army today has forged new prestige in the blood of its rebirth. Although Vekllei is an island nation, it maintains a large professional and conscripted army and is the third-largest contributor of personnel towards U.N. peacekeeping internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;army-types&#34;&gt;Army Types&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pictured here is a coalition of soldiers from different branches of the army. Let’s explore some of them now. Please note that this list is not comprehensive, and merely represents a portion of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s most common army branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;armipor&#34;&gt;Armipor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Armipor&lt;/em&gt; (armi denporitsa, or &lt;em&gt;army police&lt;/em&gt;), are a special branch of the secretive cross-bureau Military Intelligence Operations Council, which joins Vekllei’s sprawling espionage networks with its military infrastructure. The Armipor have many duties, including conventional military police-work, but may also engage in intelligence-gathering, counter-terrorism and rural policing work depending on the division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;somitzisma&#34;&gt;Somitzisma&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somitzisma (meaning &lt;em&gt;militia groups&lt;/em&gt;) are formal army units with training somewhere between active reservists and independent militias. Unlike reservists, they are not assigned uniforms and generally receive only periodic training. Their training focuses on a hypothetical home front, specialising in improvised warfare, urban combat and ambushes. They number some 2 million total, and represent one to the largest equipped militia forces in the world. This number would likely rapidly inflate during wartime due to high rates of firearm ownership in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;macka&#34;&gt;Macka&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A “macka” is prewar Vekllei slang for a blunt tool or implement, and at some point during occupation and independence it became attached to Vekllei’s general infantry. Vekllei mackas number some 90,000 serving, and make up the bulk of Vekllei’s professionalised infantry. Mackas are reinforced by nearly a million active reservists, conscripted through Mandatory Service and equipped for defensive fighting. Their equipment varies dramatically, since they are trained for a variety of environments, including Vekllei’s warm southern climates and arctic warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;carasbine&#34;&gt;Carasbine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Carasbine (commandos, derived from &lt;em&gt;carbine&lt;/em&gt;), are Vekllei’s special forces. Broadly defined as any Vekllei army unit attached to unconventional forms of warfare (since counterterrorism and domestic paramilitary roles are served by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net/posts/2020-07-08-police/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;venopor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), the country’s strategic focus on high-value and covert ops require a flexible fighting force. Although structured within Vekllei’s army hierarchy, their function has considerable latitude among divisions and often intersects with active operations planned and directed by the bureaus of National Intelligence. To this end, Vekllei maintains commandos trained for sabotage, hostage-rescue, special offensive action, combat diving, and manhunts. They often support and work alongside espionage agents of the NI bureaus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tzipora&#34;&gt;Tzipora&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora does not have a gun and is not very good at killing the enemy and/or invading foreign nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She does, however, enlist in the Garden Corps for Mandatory Service and spends her military years growing flowers in street garden boxes, severely distracting any foreign invading force with their beauty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is Bea&lt;/strong&gt;, an energetic Botanist with the Landscape Bureau of Vekllei. People know her as an eccentric young woman easily persuaded by cottage-fashions, but she takes her work very seriously and spends most of her waking hours documenting the dense temperate rainforests of Vekllei’s coastal lowlands. These are not particularly adventurous expeditions — most of her work is performed along old trails and paths, but Bea finds the sublime amidst the mundane and has contributed enormously to the ecological understanding of local flora in the borough of &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/holsyim&#34;&gt;Holsyim&lt;/a&gt;, where she was born. She specialises in Bryology, the study of mosses and soft green bric-a-brac found abundant on Vekllei’s cool wet forest floors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish her luck on her work, it benefits all people to know and respect the smallest of things around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It would be misleading to characterise Vekllei as environmentalist in the usual idea of the word&lt;/strong&gt;. Vekllei is no such thing. This is obvious in subtle ways, like Newda’s &lt;em&gt;Dumousiantopet&lt;/em&gt;, or “beautiful and seperate,” which advocates the separation of human and natural design. It is also policy; Vekllei is dependent on its landscape as part of &lt;em&gt;Autosuffisouitopet&lt;/em&gt;, or “self-sustenance,” and to this end sinks forests for hydroelectric dams and topples mountains for novel urban projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unlike most developed countries, Vekllei policy is still informed by an unwavering fear of the natural world. This is a country where belief in demons and fairies and trolls abound; where rivers carry names and biographies; and where Upen’s gentle animism resurrects most material into life. Vekllei is also geologically active, home to some of the world’s largest active volcanoes that grow in the tectonic fissures atop which the country sits. The forests they may sink; but should certain mountains come back to life, entire cities will be consumed in fire and ash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This inspires a fear of nature as old as the history of human settlement in the country. Most Vekllei people worship a pantheon of traditional animist gods alongside abrahamic or local faiths. This is a culture in which all things have value, and so the national superego has declined to position human civilisation as unique and consequently exploitative. To this end, Vekllei’s segregationist environmental policy is inversely a symptom of this direct connection with nature, and a cultural fear of the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, this is obvious in the “forbidden regions” of the country. After the war, vast territories of the interior were designated as &lt;em&gt;Kronaismioudelfia&lt;/em&gt;, or “crown land”. These forbid sovereign entry or human exploration in any capacity other than personal curiosity. These are dark pockets of ancient wilderness, where myth and legend abound. If you enter them and become lost, only volunteers will seek you out — for the purposes of the Vekllei government, you have exited the sovereignty of the nation-state. They function in part as natural reservations, but that neglects just how isolated, wild and untouchable these regions are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, this might seem archaic and superstitious, but like most spirituality-as-policy in the country, it serves a foundational component of Vekllei society (and subsequently, the economy). As Vekllei seeks out deindustrialisation via post-scarcity systems, a sincere respect for landscape as living and dangerous becomes essential. Mere appreciation or stewardship in abstract is, by Vekllei metrics, not much different than naked exploitation. Removing human constructions from landscape also necessitates the dismantling of landscape, cartography and tourism conceptually. There are few national parks in the country, but hundreds of &lt;em&gt;Kronaismioudelfia&lt;/em&gt;. Deep within them lurk unmapped, undocumented things — and at their hearts are pure springs, grasslands of eternal life, spirit dwellings and the souls of your ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this image, Tzipora meets her reflection with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/culture/language/#6-upotenne&#34;&gt;Upotenne&lt;/a&gt; sign for peace and friendliness. Reflections of mirror-pools in Vekllei are believed to be places to meet spirits. While your reflection may not be a spirit, your reflection is closer to their world than your own, as a deconstruction of image and physicality. In this sense, Tzipora is hoping her gesture may carry through into the other worlds and convince them of human peacefulness. Such gestures are good manners, considering she is no longer in sovereign human territory and stands in the land of gods.&lt;/p&gt;

  ❖ &lt;strong&gt;This article&lt;/strong&gt; was featured in &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/newsdesk/bulletin/2020/7&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She would spend a long time by the rivulet that ran behind her apartment.&lt;/strong&gt; She would do the housework and hang the wash out, then watch the water trickle past in the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She tried to open a jar the other day and started to cry when she couldn’t get it open. She never cried once when she saw those things in America, or got beat to shit, but these days she cried over jam. She didn’t know what was going on. Things were getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She caught her reflection in the rivulet’s water. It provoked a nausea. She was so tired. What would stop her from plunging her face into the river until she slipped right in? Would she drown and float away, never to be seen again? Or maybe, in a miracle, she might grow gills and fins and swim away, her life-force put to better use as a fish or turtle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you resolve an ache to confess sadness to someone and the instinct to protect your emotions? It wasn’t in her nature to tell people about her feelings. On some level, she looked down on it; every cell of her body told her to suffer in silence. She wore the same clothes every day. Why did she wear the same clothes every day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a fierce thing to discover within yourself that which you despise the most. She watched the foam gather around a stick wedged in the bank of the rivulet. If she’d been born elsewhere, into power and wealth rather than girlishness and poverty, she would have made an excellent thug. She wondered how much management she needed. Why was it so hard to live?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She tasted the water from the rivulet and it was cold and sweet, and said a prayer to the rivulet for its purity no matter what happened to her. The wash was dry on the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint red&#34;&gt;
  ❖ &lt;strong&gt;This article&lt;/strong&gt; was featured in &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/newsdesk/bulletin/2020/7&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NO REALTORS EXCEPT THE STATE ■ THE COUNTY THE AGENT OF THE STATE ■ THE ARCHITECT THE AGENT OF THE COUNTY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is clear that in Vekllei democracy is a way of living more than it is a form of government&lt;/strong&gt;. After all, by metrics of representation, the Atlantic nation&amp;rsquo;s electoral system often sputters and fails, undermined by the bundling of the human and natural votes as equal, and the wildly disproportionate borough system. But if democracy is a way of life and not just a ballot in its box, then we can see democracy acted out all around us in Vekllei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cities are living things; they are made up of people hurrying and talking and building. In cities, we see Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s centralised society/decentralised life contradiction lean towards &amp;ldquo;deurbanisation&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;local transparency&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four principles of Vekllei life are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-management and self-interest through Sundress Municipalism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classification of property as an independent social organ, like nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abolishment of currency and currency-substitutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economic feminisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranked in order of their immediacy to the average person, we can see that &lt;em&gt;Sundress Municipalism&lt;/em&gt; is at the core of Vekllei life. What exactly is &lt;em&gt;Sundress Municipalism&lt;/em&gt;? It describes the organisation of Vekllei cities, which are arranged around the following principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local employment, or &amp;ldquo;commutelessness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slumlessness, beautification, and a will to architecture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Property stewardship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open air and clean water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Land usefulness (&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;friendliness&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Private ownership of private needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public ownership of public needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These values are oriented around a deeply Vekllei valuation of space, and the accessibility of place and material to ordinary people. They also reveal some peculiarities in their listing &amp;ndash; what constitutes a private and public need, and what constitutes ownership, are deeply spiritual concepts in Vekllei, and their use here relies on uncoded intuition. Let us not forget we are dealing with a state that considers itself to be the human ambassador of the ground on which it sits, and so &amp;ldquo;public&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;private&amp;rdquo; include the nonhuman in their metrics. This is how, much to the amusement of foreigners, buildings can and often do &amp;ldquo;own themselves&amp;rdquo; in Vekllei. Most ownership is proved by stewardship; the use of space. The person who works the shop and lives above it, owns the shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image depicts the Vekllei city of Adouisneh, the florid culture capital of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Northwest. It is one of the &amp;ldquo;Five Crowning Cities&amp;rdquo; of Vekllei, measured by population and cultural significance, and was the site of one of the earliest parliaments in the world, centuries before the monarchy would come to power. You can see here the tension between old-world European planning and new-world Sundress Municipalism in the architecture and layout of this city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cactus bloom is beyond any bloom, I think, manufactured by plants anywhere in the world. And there you have an interesting syllogism, haven’t you? The desperate nature of the armed plant and the exquisite, beautiful efflorescence it produces. Something to think about. There you see, revealed, some processes of nature, the significance of which I don’t gather at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;Frank Lloyd Wright, Nov. 1952&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps urbanised modernity is the cactus, and Sundress Municipalism is the blossom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not that Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s feminised Municipalism represents a clean departure from how cities look and feel, but instead constitutes a rethinking of urbanism; it is an ideology of homesteads, decentralisation, clean air, food production, arts and crafts, leisure, and the spirit, if not the literal presence of, &amp;ldquo;disposable income.&amp;rdquo; It is not enough that a factory should be the property of the people who work in it; a factory should become adjacent to the home, a part of it, designed in ways that benefit the good instincts of ordinary people. Vekllei is a celebration of the architect; automatons may now do a lot of the work, but all design is deeply human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the heart of the dream. Vekllei is not a big enough country to gift each person an acre of land to do with as they wish; it is, however, sophisticated enough to decentralise that &amp;ldquo;local acre&amp;rdquo; among the community, cultivating those same values in a modern skyline and allowing the city to flow across the landscape, changing as it responds to the place around it. Ownership is important; stewardship is especially important. By allowing people to own and use land, you give them dignity. Above all, design and architecture are important for the same reason spatiality is important &amp;ndash; they give presence to and emulsify work and leisure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the mid-twentieth century, modernism began to encircle the world and the architectural and urban images once projected as utopian began to fill real space. In the 1960s this reached a saturation point; utopia was, ironically, realised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;Karatani Kojin,&lt;/em&gt; Architecture as Metaphor, &lt;em&gt;1983&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This occurred because, upon realising that art must be removed from architecture in order to safeguard it against a looming &amp;ldquo;loss of subject,&amp;rdquo; avant-garde thinkers methodologically reestablished architecture as &amp;lsquo;construction&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; utilitarian efforts towards grand ideas. With art removed, architecture was able to close in on the inherent placelessness of utopia. In Vekllei, this approach is extant (though diminished by their absurd place-metaphysics) through &lt;em&gt;Newda&lt;/em&gt;, the indigenous design ideology that continues to service architecture through social, rather than artistic, methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;big idea&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;Newda&lt;/em&gt; is an agent for, wrapped up in &lt;em&gt;Sundress Municipalism&lt;/em&gt;, is very straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city should be everywhere and nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Adouisneh, despite its thousand years of history, we can see postwar &lt;em&gt;Newda&lt;/em&gt; come to life in its integration and decentralisation of the &amp;ldquo;city&amp;rdquo; as a living process, moving people and their concerns closer together. Developed only with the consent of the architect, Vekllei has become an architocracy, serving decentralised, pleasant living through bureau monopolies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, after all, it is the necessity of state authority that is the cactus, and the middle-class free lifestyles of Vekllei people that make up the blossom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint red&#34;&gt;
  ❖ &lt;strong&gt;This article&lt;/strong&gt; was featured in &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/newsdesk/bulletin/2020/7&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For all you&amp;rsquo;ve seen of Vekllei and her characters&lt;/strong&gt;, you&amp;rsquo;ve never heard a single one of them speak. This post marks a little exploration into the Vekllei language, and a &amp;lsquo;soft launch&amp;rsquo; of my website, &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net&#34;&gt;https://millmint.net&lt;/a&gt;. The proper launch will come at the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will briefly discuss some elements shown in this infographic, &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net//utopia/vekllei/language&#34;&gt;but a large article on the language has been drafted here&lt;/a&gt;. If you have some interest in constructed language, and some of the more playful aspects of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s evolving utopian communication systems, I encourage you to take a look at it. The website is incomplete, and both the articles on characters and Vekllei itself are very incomplete. Otherwise, a growing archive, essays, and issues of the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; Bulletin are all available. Have a poke around, and let me know if anything breaks! The site has dark mode, if you&amp;rsquo;re a gamer. Just click the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;one-language-many-parts&#34;&gt;One Language, Many Parts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To borrow from the article linked above, the Vekllei language has six core systems often referred to as sublanguages. They are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net//utopia/vekllei/language/#21--spoken-vekllei&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoken Vekllei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is everyday spoken language. It draws from two glossaries with different meanings and feelings, called &lt;em&gt;Oa&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Loh&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net//utopia/vekllei/language/#22--topet&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which are logographic characters (occasionally characterised as hieroglyphs). Like other pictographic languages, &lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt; characters can be broken down into repeating components, called &lt;em&gt;Topotte&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net//utopia/vekllei/language/#23--rapotenne&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapotenne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is the traditional logographic language of names. It is much older than Topet, and has more in common with spiritual runes than modern logography.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net//utopia/vekllei/language/#24--potenne&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potenne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, lit. “&lt;em&gt;Hand-Talk&lt;/em&gt;”, is a sign language that incorporates gestures and signing to add meaning to emotion to spoken language, and occasionally in place of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net//utopia/vekllei/language/#25--upotenne&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upotenne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, lit. “&lt;em&gt;Spirit-Hand-Talk&lt;/em&gt;”, as the recreation of runes in human form, used limitedly in spiritual ritual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net//utopia/vekllei/language/#26--vekllei-semaphore&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei Semaphore&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the codification of colour and shape. Traditionally limited to colour, shape and pattern are now also included in &lt;em&gt;Vekllei Semaphore&lt;/em&gt;, in which full sentences can be formed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-this-picture&#34;&gt;In This Picture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see various parts of the Vekllei sublanguages on display, including &lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rapotenne&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Potenne&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Vekllei Semaphore&lt;/em&gt;. Before Cobian gets close enough to say hello, Tzipora has already delivered a devastating compliment via a simple three-finger tap to the palm, admiring how she looks. A couple of descriptions of Tzipora written in &lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt; have been annotated on her left, to demonstrate its use, including a tongue-twister (&amp;ldquo;She always tucks her shirt&amp;rdquo; becomes &amp;ldquo;Louisn Laismoh Loah Liousmineh&amp;rdquo;). You&amp;rsquo;ll notice &lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt; looks especially hieroglyphic, even by pictographic standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora&amp;rsquo;s full Blood Name is spelled out in &lt;em&gt;Rapotenne&lt;/em&gt; below, which is markedly different from &lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt; in history, characters and grammar. Most formal names in Vekllei employ a seal in place of writing it out in full ornamentation, which has been provided below along with a formal signature. Her signature is entirely pictographic; elements are arranged according to symbolic value, rather than phonological legibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the right, we can see an example of how Semaphore lives up to its name through its presence on flags, reinforcing and communicating information without conventional literacy. Also shown are a handful of basic symbols as they relate to authority, with the landscape of Vekllei superseding all human organs. Their colours matter, and so their meanings are more complex than what is described here &amp;ndash; for example, a small black circle refers to a human being, but an orange one refers to an arctic person (usually Vekllei).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have a breakdown of the word &lt;em&gt;comiya&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net//utopia/vekllei/language/#222-phonetic-reading&#34;&gt;also looked at here&lt;/a&gt;), which means &amp;ldquo;friend.&amp;rdquo; Tzipora and Cobian are &lt;em&gt;comiya&lt;/em&gt;, and Moise and Cobian are&amp;hellip; sort of &lt;em&gt;comiya&lt;/em&gt;. The introduction here of &lt;em&gt;phonetic complements&lt;/em&gt;, which are duplicate consonant-pairs used to slightly alter the semantic meaning of a word without changing its pronunciation, allows the idea of a &amp;ldquo;friend&amp;rdquo; to be conceptualised in many different ways, to encompass all sorts of relationships. This one here implies a sort of naïve love (by using characters for late autumn, young woman and a glacial beach, all pronounced /k/.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limpettes are tails that underline vowel-forms called &lt;em&gt;hieyerette&lt;/em&gt; to enhance legibility. Although ornamented &lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt; has visually distinct consonant-pairings, business &lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt; does not generally use superscript and so limpettes designate the vowel-form. If you&amp;rsquo;re a bit lost, that&amp;rsquo;s okay. It&amp;rsquo;s in the main article, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to make this post too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can imagine then, even with only a handful of examples of language in practice here, how complex Vekllei can become as phonological and semantic meaning compound, combine and seperate in different forms and contexts. The spoken word can be altered by the physical gesture, and the physical gesture can be altered by the written word.&lt;/p&gt;

  ❖ &lt;strong&gt;This article&lt;/strong&gt; was featured in &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/newsdesk/bulletin/2020/7&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the light shifted just right&lt;/strong&gt;, the ceramic tiles and concrete footpaths twinkled like water off the back of a swan. 16th Century witches could build a hut in the woods and forage for herbs; 21st Century witches were susceptible to modernist persuasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Demotic Meeting Hall was constructed twenty years prior as the main meeting hall of the National Dockworker’s Union. Situated on the coast, and along the recently-built monorail line to Roya, it dominated the coastline like a mythic lighthouse. Where the cathedrals of Europe built spires to God, Vekllei built towers for dockmen. At 112 meters tall, the hall’s colossal window structures were awesome within, and its massive bronze ornament glittered for miles. It was palatial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dockworker’s Union moved west to Montre at some point, so these days it was simply the Roya Demotic Community Hall. It was used for all sorts of things, not least of which domestic tourism. Its lookout provided views across the North-West Fjords. When Tzipora first arrived in Vekllei, the scale and decadence of it appealed to her enormously. It was depicted on her language booklet, and since then she’d developed a minor fascination with the structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She got her chance to visit upon her invitation to a costume party hosted by the Chef’s Concern. Tzipora is a witchy sort of person, and the idea of going as a witch appealed to her. She already had the wardrobe — as Cobian remarked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’ve put on a hat and you’re holding a stick — that’s it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s my costume,” Zelda said. “I’m a witch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see her here attempting to recreate the sumptuous curve of the Meeting Hall in witch form.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Petrol Heaven — The Rohsm STR-750</title>

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint red&#34;&gt;
  ❖ &lt;strong&gt;This article&lt;/strong&gt; was featured in &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/newsdesk/bulletin/2020/6&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rohsm STR series&lt;/strong&gt; is a small racer built for clubs by Rohsm S.p.M., a hundred-year-old company headquartered in the Mediterranean racing culture of Tohs. Its most recent variant, the 750, is available in limited quantities to enthusiast owners and club pools. Like most petrol cars in Vekllei, they are built by hand, so no two 750s drive exactly alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to its neighbouring continents, petrol cars are criminally unsafe in Vekllei, where a preference for speed and lightweight manoeuvrability in European bodies see much of the steel of electric autos traded for light alloys and carbon. They crumple like drink cans in a crash, but prior to their death the driver is having the best driving experience of his life. This reckless pursuit of good driving means locals call them “bastard cars”. Extraordinarily lightweight and tremendously powerful, they cut sharp racing lines and trace corners. Poised and nimble, they make good use of Motorway One, the gentle curved ring road of Vekllei with no speed limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the inconvenience of finding petrol stations and their relative danger, not many people drive petrol cars in Vekllei. Why would you, when it is usually faster and more convenient to take a fast tram or train, or a battery auto from an autopool? The ones that do drive, however, drive hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pictured is the 25th STR-750, returned home after wins on the circuit in Italy and Spain. Her drivers are pictured above. It also happens to be Tzipora’s favourite car, because it was the first petrol car she ever drove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei’s obvious contradictions are commonly referenced, but not always clear&lt;/strong&gt;. Why are parts of Vekllei epistemology, or the ‘Vekllei way of thinking,’ contradictory? And if these are contradictions, then surely they must fall apart when they’re examined? How is it possible to hold two contradictory ideas at the same time and apply them? Let’s look at Product Atheism, Vekllei’s foundation for necroeconomics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Atismoprodarte&lt;/em&gt;, lit. “product atheism,” is the process by which Vekllei culture breaks down and rebuilds social preconceptions of objects, including products. Vekllei does not really have &lt;strong&gt;commodities&lt;/strong&gt; in the traditional idea of the word, so it is supplemented here by ‘&lt;strong&gt;product&lt;/strong&gt;,’ which more closely resembles the Vekllei word for commodity-forms: &lt;em&gt;prodart&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;prodatte&lt;/em&gt;. This concept is a part of &lt;em&gt;Upen&lt;/em&gt;, which is found throughout Vekllei culture and its constitution, and coexists agnostically with organised religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Product Atheism” is the term for how Vekllei people think about the objects that make up their lives — clothes, appliances, toys, trinkets and treasures. These things are not quite commodities, because they are not “sold”. Vekllei does not use money, and so it does not produce items of any economic value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An object’s economic form, then, is replaced by social form. Among Marxists, they call these social forms &lt;em&gt;fetishistic&lt;/em&gt;, because products are given lives of their own and exist independently of the labour that created them. But this doesn’t work in Vekllei, because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Labour-value is social, not economic&lt;/strong&gt;. Vekllei people are not paid for work and they do not pay money for products. All work is for social reasons; all consumption is for social needs. Any object that is prohibited from the ordinary Vekllei person is merely landscape; it has no form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Labour-value is simultaneously suppressed, in imitation of commodity, and celebrated, in imitation of dereification&lt;/strong&gt;. Vekllei shops look like any foreign shops, because they participate in the same fantasy ritual of shopping and allow easy access to products. At the same time, Upen emphasises the importance of local consumption and objects made by hand, and so Vekllei appliances are generally hand-made. This creates a social bond between the producer and consumer, and breaks down commodity-form, but it can’t escape the fetishised valuations encouraged by the consumer-fantasy. So it is neither a social or economic product while being both; resulting in a permanent contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Vekllei ‘Product Atheism’ is more or less a rejection of Marxist commodity fetishism, and instead advocates product-worship. This is because objects in Vekllei are regarded as fantasy, and are eroticised by a fantasy market. This is a symptom of the unspoken truth most foreigners are well aware of — Vekllei does not have an economy; &lt;strong&gt;the Vekllei economy is dead; the economy has been reanimated and is zombified&lt;/strong&gt;. No money changes hands, no product has value, and all products are abstracted and exclusively physical simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus Product Atheism has two contradictions; first, that the participatory market economy of Vekllei is both alive and dead, making it both undead and unaliave, and second, that products are both abstracted by Product Atheism and then unabstracted through Product Atheism at the same time, leaving them formless and unconstructed — and, per Upen’s definitions, truly personal and intimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging this necroeconomic construction destroys it, and so a final truth is revealed. In Vekllei, the exchange of objects is a &lt;strong&gt;social formality&lt;/strong&gt;, like their uniforms and sign-language, and is both entirely superfluous and essential to the functioning of the state. This is not Marxism; this is not even economic; this is Vekllei, and its cultural forms are what determine all constructions of society. Vekllei’s ‘material form’ is actually cultural, and Upen is its culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Vekllei economic forms are not truly economic, it makes sense that Product Atheism does not merely apply to the economy. All products, or objects, are part of its frameworks. The example used in this picture, depicting women’s fashion, is a good example of how Upen brings together an abstract object value and a valueless physical object simultaneously. Clothes in Vekllei have a very powerful social function, enhanced by how colour and shape become forms of communication in themselves as part of Vekllei semaphore. Clothes are both figuratively and literally signifiers of personality and individual expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vekllei written script, called &lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt;, most traditional clothing items are each assigned a single character, giving them a transcendental pictographic quality, a feature impossible to replicate in phonetic speech. In this sense, the written description of a dress in Vekllei supersedes its spoken equivalent, privileging pictorial, transcendental imagery over literalism. This poetic form is part of product-worship, and thus part of Product Atheism. This means that, without even touching the sociological tastes and trends of clothing fashion in Vekllei, we can see Product Atheism smashing Western frameworks against their own assumptions, leaving much of Vekllei epistemology, even today, incomprehensible to ideology without &lt;em&gt;Upen&lt;/em&gt; as its framework.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Uniforms in Vekllei</title>
      <link>https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-09-08-uniforms/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;


  
  


&lt;a  href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/iocwxt/clean_faces_full_hearts_uniforms_in_vekllei/&#34;   target=&#34;_blank&#34;  class=&#34;book-btn&#34;&gt;
  Archived from the original article here
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint red&#34;&gt;
  ❖ &lt;strong&gt;This article&lt;/strong&gt; was featured in &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/newsdesk/bulletin/2020/5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Vekllei, uniforms are prevalent across all levels of society&lt;/strong&gt;. They are perhaps the most obvious example of the opaque contradictions at the heart of Vekllei life, caught between wholly opposing ideas: between tradition and progress; liberty and control; and, most crucially here — between individualism and the burden of society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depicted here are uniforms for education — Tzipora as a puffling of the Puffin Scouts on the left, and the others in mere school uniforms. These uniforms are universal and used across all ages of schooling, from kindergarten to university. Even some teachers wear them — it starts to stretch the conventional imagination about what constitutes a uniform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few observations on this picture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, these uniforms are used interchangeably across ages and disciplines. The difference between a red pleat skirt and a navy skirt is trivial; it is merely a difference in the meaning of the clothing, as part of Vekllei semaphore. They are both equally the school-mandated uniform of education, and can be worn interchangeably from one day to the next, in third grade and at university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, there are many small uniquenesses in the uniform of each person, which are accentuated by their surrounding uniformity. Tzipora’s school shirt is pleated along the buttons, acquired off the rack of a department store. One pair of trousers might be a slightly different shade to the pair next to it. These discrepancies are not regarded as malfunctions of the uniform system, since the system is not designed to make each student conform to a single appearance — it is about identity and convenience in a country that spent many decades clawing its way out of abject poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These principles apply across many workplaces and in government, too — where uniforms are not intended to only signify publicly a place of work but instead form social bonds through clothing, which are intimate factors of ordinary life. In Vekllei, clothes are not an expression of personality, but items to communicate and bond with, regulated not by an authority demanding strict conformity but a desire for identity, physicality, infrastructure and convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a state of affairs is unimaginable in some countries, especially beyond collectivist or conformist cultures. Individualist intuition suggests that uniforms are actively detrimental to personal expression — but this idea demands a scale of expression far beyond the preference for subtlety and delicateness in Upen. Deviations from uniformity, like earrings, the way hair is worn, wristwatches, makeup and minor irregularities accentuate the value of those things, and make them more important. This aesthetic contrast is at the heart of the wider Upen intuition that you can see in architecture and political priority alike. And, as any Vekllei boy will tell you — seeing a classroom crush out of uniform for the first time is a religious experience, and only afforded by scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei is an individualist society, modelled after self-concern and self-love by a salt-of-the-earth and larrikin people of my native Australia. This is not a people compatible with conventional thinking on the regulation of appearance — but, as with many things in Vekllei, both are held true at the same time. They are a free and unrestrained population clothed at work and in school in clothes gifted to them.
As an addendum, although many readers find common ancestry with Japan in this project (not unreasonably, either), Vekllei has more in common in some ways with the distant neighbours of my Australian homeland — countries that haven’t been glamorised in the West through culture export. Thailand, Cambodia and Laos are among them — coincidentally, all three are rare examples of countries where university students wear uniforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someday, we’ll look at the aesthetics of power and authority-worship, inspired at least in part by the history and culture of these countries, and associate them with cultural forces in Vekllei. If you have any questions, just ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the morning of the second day, I watched a fly crawl across the cheek of the middle-aged woman, probably an office worker, lying next to me. It moved up her cheekbone to her temple, stopping now and then to rub its front legs as though performing a ritual.
A jagged tear ran down the leg of her dark blue work trousers, but the white calf it revealed was miraculously unscathed. The woman lay still. Probably dead, I assumed. After a while, the fly got on to her eyelid. Suddenly, she reached up and brushed it away, opening the eye. There was still a moist light inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From &lt;em&gt;Insects&lt;/em&gt;, by Seirai Yūichi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By chance, the glass paperweight had survived. When her in-laws’ house had burnt down in Yokohama, the paperweight was among those things that she’d frantically stuffed into an emergency bag, and now it was her only souvenir of life in her girlhood home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From evening on, in the alley, she could hear the strange cries of the neighbourhood girls. Rumour had it that they could make a thousand yen in a single night. Now and then she would find herself holding the forty-sen paperweight she had bought after ten days of indecision when she was these girls’ age, and as she studied the sweet little dog in relief, she would realise with a shock that there was not a single dog left in the whole burnt-out neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From &lt;em&gt;The Silver Fifty-Sen Pieces&lt;/em&gt;, by Kawabata Yasunari&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the 14th of August 2111&lt;/strong&gt;, the Atomic War began in a Chinese submarine in the South Pacific, and ended six hours later. The war marks the single greatest loss of life in human history and would disrupt human life on Earth in previously unimaginable ways — consumer society bottomed out, the world became small, the Earth grew cold, and a new chapter in human history was opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This political map marks the territories of Earth as they stand five years on, in 2116. There are fewer countries in the world today than in any other point in human history, in part because the catastrophic reduction in human population — some 520-600 millions in the first year — has emptied out countries and rendered others uninhabitable. Many of these territories here are disputed and, in some cases, autonomous — for simplicity, they are presented as they are recognised by the U.N.
The map also presents a long-exposure view of the war as it happened, and its remaining fallout currents today. Red dots mark significant nuclear detonations on August 14th. Yellow dots mark surface warfare in some capacity. Red trails mark missile flight, reduced in number here by strict denuclearisation treaties of the decades previous. Yellow trails mark the flight paths of atomic bombers, both supersonic and subsonic. This map does not record failed launches, intercepted missiles or downed aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fighting was arranged along political axes — namely Western (U.S., U.K., West Germany &amp;amp; N.A.T.O. members), Warsaw Pact (U.S.S.R., Cuba, Egypt), East Asian (China &amp;amp; Korea), and non-aligned (Vekllei, France, Brazil). The war experience was unique to each country — Vekllei exchanged warheads and bombs with China but not Warsaw countries, the U.S.S.R. exchanged with both Western and East Asian members, and Brazil fought a catastrophic war against both Soviet and American territories. The immediate aftermath saw a quiet Earth, much of it scorched. Temperatures dropped by 10 degrees centigrade for the first six months, and slowly warmed as debris cleared in the following years. Wide-scale firestorms were tempered by rains that followed the war shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some 274 millions of the dead are accounted for in China, where in 2116 the cities still lie in rot, swollen with corpses; heavy with miasma; concrete dams bleached and cracked; the wood all burned up; the rivers warped and quiet; dead fish along them; a surfaced water main weeping blood; harsh asbestine whistling; railcars in a ditch; sloughing skin; tremors; smoke with no fires; confused wandering; bleeding from the inside; families-as-sand; sand-as-trinitite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exchanges were confused, helter-skelter, and the combatants rattle off like a death snare. The U.S.S.R., the U.S., France, and Vekllei all exchanged death with China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would take more than mere annihilation to extinguish the P.R.C., but the toll was nauseating. Beijing and Shanghai were simply disappeared; there was nothing where there once was. The fistfuls of rebar and concrete amidst glassy, ossified landscape were heaped into direct administration of the U.N. The following year, 40-120 million more Chinese would succumb to the greatest famine in the history of the world. Of course, in the U.N., there was good argument for the nuclear retaliation — China launched first; why should money and food go to the perpetrator of the vastest disaster in human history? One can’t help but wonder if the life of an Oriental coolie wells fewer tears than his equivalent in Paris. There are not enough flowers in the world to pay tribute to the dead of China, who were simply dispensed with in European memory and subsumed in part by the United Nations. The communist party would continue to control the vast interior, divided into two states by ethnography, where 1949 seemed closer than ever. Necrotic politics are legitimised in the land of the dead.
Soon, we saw the consolidation of nation-states into geographic regions with a disregard for ethnography not seen since the colonial years. This was met with violent resistance in some places — in others, locals capitulated to the extraordinary hyperreality of the postwar world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Nations was quickly catapulted into the status of a de facto administrative world government in a last-ditch attempt to ‘freeze time’ as it were, in order to provide the superpowers time to recover from the scope of immediate devastation and prevent humanity from entering a long period of decline. This involved the moving of soldiers on a scale unseen since the World Wars, as U.N. international brigades propped up vulnerable, scorched territories in Central/Western Europe and Asia. The immediate peace of the first days after the war was ruthlessly enforced — and strategic opportunism was threatened to meet indiscriminate violence and U.N.-sanctioned nuclear retaliation. There was some belief that the status quo could carry on. So troops of non-combatant countries were supplied, and in some cases press-ganged, into this global mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battered United States, acknowledging its ‘century of decline’, found itself consolidating control over its urban, though devastated, coasts. The awkward appellation &amp;ldquo;Dallas America&amp;rdquo; was used as a colloquial shorthand for a disputed territory that insisted on referring to itself as the legitimate United States. The name was only superseded by the ridiculous &amp;ldquo;United Nations Heartlands of the United States,&amp;rdquo; the Aid Region of the U.S. interior that had collapsed in the days after the war. This was buffered by the Mojave and Great Lakes Special Administrative Regions, federal territories that contained war industry and nuclear infrastructure that propped up the precarious coasts. Despite efforts to revive agriculture in the scorched U.N. Heartlands U.S., starvation was met with martial law along the coasts the following year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.N. was granted temporary, direct control over several collapsed territories that had either succumbed to nuclear fire or had caved to anarchy in the weeks and months after. In some cases, like the U.N. regions in Hawaii, Jerusalem and the Central Europe International War Government, these behaved as states in themselves, administrated directly by the United Nations Mission for War Recovery. In others, they were merely named as such with the vague promise of future aid. U.N. Cuba and U.N. Taiwan were such examples, in which devastation had been so catastrophic that little remained to govern, and the local population was mostly left to anarchy. In general, there were great inequalities in how the U.N. chose to dedicate resources, largely informed by its largest nation-states and political interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are thousands of stories from communities and territories across the world directly impacted by the war — from the atomic bombing of Sydney to the catastrophic reactor meltdowns of Brazil’s south. The war was unprecedented in scale and devastation. This map reveals little of the profoundly human tragedy that was brought about, nor does it invoke the difficult existential artefacts that are still being reckoned with. Perhaps humans are just animals after all — destined to die out the way so many have in this age. Most tragic was not the colossal scale of death, or the collapse and pain that followed, but the upending of domestic society into violence, in which people of consumer society — the middle class — found themselves with not much at all, thrust into a world of chaos and suffering in which all prior epistemologies evaporated. Like the flash of blue light that preceded the roar, it was the stuff in supermarkets and department stores that marked the absolute grotesqueing of life in the new age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/ed8zwv/life_and_death_in_vekllei_apartment_ideology_or/&#34;&gt;Newda is Vekllei’s national architectural ideology&lt;/a&gt;, applied flexibly in a range of modernist styles developed domestically in her architecture schools. Broadly, Newda buildings emphasise distinction from the surrounding landscape (called &lt;em&gt;Dumousiantopet&lt;/em&gt;, or ‘beautiful and seperate’), natural decay, and honesty in material and construction. Vekllei’s great Parliament House is Newda; as are the little rural homes found in the mountains inland in Vekllei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora’s house in the village of Montre-Lola (&lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.studio/newsroom/blog/posts/2020-06-29-montrelola/&#34;&gt;as depicted on the map here&lt;/a&gt;) is built in what Vekllei calls “Azores revivalism”, a Newda style heavily influenced by the stripped deco and streamline moderne buildings of a century prior. It is part of a constant conversation Newda holds with its past, as both a deeply modernist, progressive school and one bound up in the wider aesthetic and cultural traditions of Upen, the spiritualism of Vekllei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her house is small, but appears larger due to the layout of the structure. A small sleeping loft sits atop the living, bathing and cooking areas of the home, and opens out into a private rooftop garden. The utilities tower also hides a small staircase leading to the roof, which is also accessible for outdoor recreation. Her home stands amidst the farmland of Montre-Lola, and very near the library and primary school where she works. Her property is marked at its end by a creek that runs into the Dentre River. She has a vegetable garden in her backyard, and shares her paddocks with her neighbours for grazing periodically throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her house was erected in gratitude by her neighbours out of prefab components, and assisted by a “construction line,” — a temporary rail line in which goods are delivered and cranes are supported, minimising the need for lorries. Houses of this type and period are rarely seen in agricultural settings in other countries, but in Vekllei, where Landscape has been abolished, there might as well be no difference between a building suitable for the cosmopolitan, coastal cities and a dwelling for a farmer-girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint red&#34;&gt;
  ❖ &lt;strong&gt;This article&lt;/strong&gt; was featured in &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/newsdesk/bulletin/2020/4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The concept of living forever&lt;/strong&gt; jumps out at people uncomfortable with their own existence. There is a contemplative instinct among educated people that — if they could simply will themselves into a state of self-actualisation — death would only be an obstacle to greatness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Tzipora found out quickly, the opposite was true — death and temporality  were wells of meaning against which all great people, beauty, and human constructions were cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora Desmoisnes is what is known as a Gregori Baby, a catch-all term for a unique genetic condition that has seemingly produced a variety of miracle children appropriate for the frothing futurism of the atomic age — boys and girls who, suspended in the purity and good-naturedness of childhood — live forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no single “Gregori Baby” — each is unique, and Tzipora is the 13th to have been recognised overall. The phrase is a shortening of Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome, a stand-in for medical information that isn’t there. The first, Gregori Hordiyenko, was born in 2024. He was healthy, and died of unrelated causes in his 20s. Tzipora, at 13th, continues to live to this day and is the oldest person on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a disturbing trend among the Gregori children, first heralded as miracles and symptoms of the space age, to deteriorate medically as more are born. The culprit is the malfunctioning of telomeres in their DNA — the source of their longevity — which regularly produce devastating chromosomal disorders, including Trisomy 13 &amp;amp; 18, killing most “ageless children” before their third birthday. Those that survive are often victims of a severe anaphylaxis caused by a hyperactive immune system — rendering many of them permanently sickly. Others find themselves unageing, but continue to grow — reaching as tall as 2.5m before their bodies give out from exhaustion and osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is Gregori syndrome? What does your average (healthy) Gregori baby look like? Their genetic miracle is linked to the structures of the body that activate at puberty, and so girls vary between 11-16 years of age at onset depending on many factors that affect their development. Boys tend to be a little younger, from 8-14. Between the two, girls tend to be more stable, and all but two of the supercentenarian Gregori children are female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among girls, they are prepubescent and generally stop ageing on the eve of menarche, or their first period. In Tzipora’s case, her body is estimated to be 13 years and 11 months old. Unlike many Gregori children, Tzipora lives in a wealthy country and has volunteered for extensive research into her genetic makeup, meaning that much of early medical documentation around Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome was received directly from her case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most obvious is that, at a foundational level, her cells are similar in function to unipotent stem cells, and have been since hormones at the end of thelarche suspended her ageing. This change has occurred somewhere in her DNA — exactly where is unknown — but the end result is that, unlike regular progenitor cells that make up most adult bodies, the building blocks of her body are capable of cell-renewal. Her telomeres, the endcaps of chromosomal DNA in mammals, are undamaged. And so there is an amazing shift in her basic human structure — in which human cell lineage, which usually ends in a mature cell incapable of division, is caught and rearranged. With this considered, it is no wonder that Gregori children suffer from such catastrophic chromosomal instability, and why healthy ageless babies are a rarity. Her body is not exactly a “body of stem cells,” but for their function in a healthy Gregori child, they might as well be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is that nothing about Tzipora is changing. She suffers from pains in her legs often — called growing pains, although they are not from growing — and her cells continue to replenish, albeit at a rate 1.25 times that of normal people. She is, in essence, “growing” as any other premenarchal girl would, but she is not getting bigger or becoming older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora is blessed with an adult life in Vekllei, where the “Child” does not exist as it does in the West, and her individual freedoms are far-ranging. She may smoke, and drink, and has held many different jobs in her life. She holds two doctorates in English and Vekllei Literature. She is obviously sterile — even if she were to somehow “age out” of prepubescence into pubescence and receive the required hormones, she simply lacks the genetic code to reproduce — but raises many children through her active participation in village life and her roles as Montre-Lola’s municipal and school librarian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other countries, with coded roles for children, their problems are much greater. Unable to form adult relationships and often incapable of finding work, many work in entertainment or fall into poverty as they outlive their friends and parents. Socially ostracised and forever young, many are victims of superstition and fear. As the pattern of Gregori children indicates an increase in mortality, even as more are born, their appearance is both a miracle and a tragedy — ageing not through mitosis but through weathering the societies in which they live.&lt;/p&gt;

  ❖ &lt;strong&gt;This article&lt;/strong&gt; was featured in &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/newsdesk/bulletin/2020/4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-epoch-of-rest&#34;&gt;The Epoch of Rest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve spent a lot of time in the 21st century — but Tzipora is biologically immortal. Where does she go from here? Well, let’s enjoy a small glimpse at that future together, by winding the clock forward one thousand years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 3076, our Solar System is a pleasant place to be. Most of the planets we once gazed at from afar are now habitable and lived on. The Great Epoch of Rest has begun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no great interstellar empire, no rise and fall of spacefaring supernations — a Vekllei way of life is now lived out in multicultural, prosperous clusters of people across our Solar System. The ordinary person is afforded incredible freedoms previously reserved for science fiction through the accessibility of personal light spacecraft, translated literally as “boats”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This here is the M-7000 APRICOT, manufactured by the Government Aerospace Factories (GAF) of Vekllei. Many companies are contracted by the GAF, including General Reactor S.A., to whom this boat lends most of its flight control systems and all of its power plant. It is a light, personal boat for women built in 2807, making it relatively unique in both its 28th century design language and its gendered marketing. While the personal boat market was growing rapidly by this time, the vast majority of owners and pilots were men. The APRICOT set out to change that, and Tzipora, the world’s oldest living person with a youthful face, was among the first to demonstrate the accessibility and freedoms of space travel for women and girls in the personal boat market. It was her first boat, and despite its orientation for women it was christened with a male name: BARON.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a comfortable and pleasant craft that can be lived in for extended periods of time. Tzipora has done just that, travelling to stars in search of water-planets with Micronesian archipelagos, where she likes to spend most of her time. Its glass roof across the entire accessible cabin, including bubbled cockpit, gives it breathtaking visibility in the depths of space and the most scenic of planets alike. Like almost all spacecraft, it is unarmed, save for the pacifying “jazz” electric canon, named for its firing sound reminiscent of a double bass strum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she tires of being alone, she returns to her hometown of Montre-Lola in Vekllei frequently. Boats are usually parked at off-world stations, preserving the aerospace and quiet of the Solar System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light speed is exceeded through superluminal travel. So-called black boxes require extraordinarily precise programming, since superluminal travel is in all ways but name time travel, and the universe does not tolerate time travel. Coordinates calculated in the universal pyramid system by a pyramid computer ensure that a vessel arrives when it arrives, so to speak. The alternative is going nowhere at all — there is no in-between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superluminal systems are affected by gravity, so any person looking to exceed the speed of light and subsequently visit other stars must take the highways beyond our home system’s planetary orbit and launch into so-called free-travel from there. There are only a handful of these highways — the solar system is very, very large, and human construction is very, very small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an instinct among many people that human progress would naturally scale exponentially — these were extrapolated from the remarkable progress in the lifetime of Tzipora’s parents and grandparents, who saw canvas aircraft in their childhood advance to the landing of a man on the moon, and again in her own exaggerated lifetime, in which the provinciality of her youth has simultaneously seen an expansion and exploitation of the planets in our native solar system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This curve of progress was not to be, however — and it also explains why we had such trouble meeting aliens in the first place. Part of it was simply that there are very few worlds with water that also formed earthlike landmasses nearby — there are many aliens, and Tzipora has seen many herself, but most of them are fish and fish-adjacent. The second is that, if there is civilised life out there, it has most probably encountered the same engineering truths that humanity did, in our great interstellar project of the last thousand years. Namely that, all accounted for, there is no use for wasteful megastructures when a small one will do. People are having less children — on Mars, Mercury and Neptune, the population is actually shrinking. What good is the so-called “ocean liner of the stars,” with a capacity of millions? There are around 12 billion people across the solar system today. Maybe another 8 billion in the Ala system. Maybe a few millions more who have simply given up society for scattered stars in our neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is likely that if any other civilised races exist, they are simply of our scale, or have destroyed themselves completely in the reckless pursuit of expansion. Humanity is lucky not to count themselves among them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The APRICOT is one of many models produced by Vekllei’s Government Aerospace Factories. It is now possible for the ordinary person to explore distant stars for themselves, granting freedoms unimaginable in a previous age. Such is life in the Great Epoch of Rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Azores had been a possession of Vekllei since 2002, when they were leased from Portugal indefinitely. The lease was defunct by the time of Vekllei’s independence from U.K. occupation in 2015, and the new state took formal ownership over the small Atlantic islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Azores was Vekllei’s resort region, often called simply the “holiday isles”. Brief reprieves from the North Atlantic cold were granted to hundreds of thousands domestic tourists each year in resorts and holiday rentals alike. Tzipora spent the summer of 2079 there. Good memories were made in that summer. She did not much like the beach but she liked the ocean. If she could retire, it would be in the Azores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;veklleis-advocation-of-austerity-apathy-and-playfulness-as-economic-principles&#34;&gt;Vekllei’s advocation of austerity, apathy, and playfulness as economic principles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is about the economy of Vekllei. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a long one. If you have any questions, just ask.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;overview-of-the-bureau-system&#34;&gt;Overview of the Bureau System&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are many thousands of companies busy with work in Vekllei&lt;/strong&gt;. The vast majority of these companies are single-person shops (S.p.A., or &lt;em&gt;senrouiva pettetie anaproiouya&lt;/em&gt;). Also common are wobbly shops, or co-operative businesses (S.q.A., or &lt;em&gt;senrouiva qualitie anaproiouya&lt;/em&gt;). The largest of the non-bureau companies are village factories (S.p.M., or &lt;em&gt;senrouiva persimonaya manufacturie&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bureau-level world is full of company mastheads that emphasise modernity, dynamism and progress. Vekllei’s “private businesses”, however, tend to be local in taste. The vast majority of S.p.A. and S.q.A. businesses bear the family names of their founders — Desmesyo S.p.A., Risyiouisnesn Home Machines S.q.A., etc. Their legal denominations are almost always affixed to the end of their nameplates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;em&gt;senrouiva&lt;/em&gt; designation marks them as non-bureau businesses. A &lt;em&gt;bureau&lt;/em&gt;, as a reminder, is simply the top-level organisation of a trade union that organises business in the country. In practice, it means that a company is responsible to the political organs of the country. Although independent from the government, bureau business is inextricably entwined in government concern and runs parallel to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Senrouvia&lt;/em&gt; businesses are also part of the bureau structure, but are in practice not managed directly by them. They are usually united in local concern by so-called &lt;em&gt;petty bureaus&lt;/em&gt;; small cooperative organs that safeguard local interest and business. These petty bureaus are often at odds with the bureau organs proper, and so even though they are part of the same structure, they are fundamentally political opposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is sort of business goes on in a bureau proper?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two common categories of so-called “bureau firms”. You have state industries (S.A., or &lt;em&gt;societie indastrie&lt;/em&gt;), which deal with manufacturing and exploitation of resources that require direct management by a public organ. You’ll already be familiar with several — General Reactor S.A., Comen Aeroyards S.A., Farmer’s Syndicate S.A. to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also have state requisites (A.r., or &lt;em&gt;requoisesiasn amourisocietie&lt;/em&gt;), which refer to the vast government-operated organs made up six categories primarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilities (A.r.Un.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transport (A.r.R.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Education (A.r.E.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local healthcare (A.r.F.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Construction (A.r.Lo.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automation (A.r.M.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes — education is not organised as a government department, but a bureau business. Other state responsibilities are folded directly into government departments — war, intelligence, healthcare, police, fire, and the mint are all managed directly by the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;argument&#34;&gt;Argument&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the legal division of enterprise laid out, let us examine again the four precepts of the Vekllei economic ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-management and self-interest through Sundress Municipalism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classification of property as an independent social organ, like nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abolishment of currency and currency-substitutes. Participatory employment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economic feminisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These four principles reveal a great deal about the character of the country, and stand largely at face value. There is an interest in chasing the promises of modernity while deconstructing its metaphysical constructions, through the abolishment of exchange-value, property and the overhaul of gender-economics. There are anarchist gestures in each principle, yet it is obvious that the product of these values complexify the conventional anarchist imagination. This is part of a series of contradictions — between free and planned markets, between internationalism and provinciality, between man and woman, between freedom and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;austerity&#34;&gt;Austerity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bureau system is plagued by inefficiencies, arising from logistic systems premised on warehousing, poor Coasean bargaining between petty bureaus and proper bureaus, a political emphasis on macroeconomic outcomes, a decoupling of aggregate demand and national economic output, cultural intolerance for Pareto inefficiencies, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luxury goods often vary in both supply and access, and economies are often severely localised to the point of provincialism, meaning that Vekllei has failed to transition reliably to a modern consumer society. The inhabitants of the Montre borough most often eat seafood because speciality meats, especially authentic red meat, are scarce. The opposite is true in &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/yana&#34;&gt;Yana&lt;/a&gt;. Clothes are repaired and regifted, appliances are available only from regional outlets usually located in the same city as the factory, and culture and diet are fiercely regional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, in part, a result of unflinching national austerity and the sublimation of artificial markets prompted by Vekllei’s gold-based auxiliary currency, which necessitates meeting debt obligations for its strength internationally. There is a belief in Vekllei that the wealth of the country allowed the abolition of the currency — in fact, the opposite is true. The abolition of currency allows a permanent wealth that compensates for the inefficiencies of the bureau system. The bureau firms do not pay their workers — on paper, there are no expenses for anything beyond raw commodity exchange. This is how Vekllei’s largest companies — and, per the bureau system, its government — remain solvent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Austerity&lt;/em&gt; is a cultural force, too — the scarcity of luxury goods inflates their social value, where comforts and necessities are largely abundant in automation. It creates an unimportant hardship that keeps Vekllei people forward-facing, lean, and ambitious. To acquire Picco S.p.A.’s iconic lounge chairs, you have to travel to their outlet in Horn, hundreds of kilometres from the capital area. There is no motivation for a craftsman to meet demand — there is no petty consumption, either. To own a Picco chair means you have understood its cultural value, utility and craftsmanship, and have made the effort to find and transport one to your home. Inconvenience, and by extension, austerity, is celebrated as a “trial of ownership.” Objects are very important in Vekllei, and craftsmanship is highly valued, and so people like to surround themselves with hand-made, sublime things wrought not just by the labour of the artisan, but their own effort to acquire it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petty &lt;em&gt;austerity&lt;/em&gt; instills a national sentiment that tells the ordinary Vekllei person they are hardier than the ordinary American or European, even if the wealth of the ordinary Vekllei person is much greater than that of the ordinary American or European.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;apathy&#34;&gt;Apathy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a vast, loosely organised private market in the &lt;em&gt;senrouiva&lt;/em&gt; categorisation, Vekllei does not reward entrepreneurial ambition. Ambitious people are funnelled into positions of power in bureau firms and political office, but the founding of S.p.As and S.q.As is rarely motivated by a desire for influence or power. Indeed, artisanal S.p.As are often incapable of the sort of economies of scale needed for expansion. Vekllei instead relies on a sort of economic &lt;em&gt;apathy&lt;/em&gt;, in which aggregate demand and productivity are spurned for immediate interest and pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ensures that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;luxury products remain creative, personal works per Upen’s insistence on the symbiosis of labour and product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the private senrouiva market is not capable of threatening the provincialism of Sundress Municipalism, which might make a commodity universally accessible and threaten to introduce generic consumer society into Vekllei life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the private senrouiva market under petty bureau organisation does not threaten the organised de facto monopolies of the bureau companies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Vekllei has replaced the commodity with the object, then it is through economic apathy that they have ensured objects will never again become commodities. Just as the ordinary Vekllei person is apolitical, so too are they apathetic towards change in their purchasing habits, favouring small, inconvenient and personal brands over those exploiting aggregate demand. In a sense, this also contributed to the popular Vekllei term &lt;em&gt;product atheism&lt;/em&gt;, in which the metaphysics of products are dismantled and rearranged into social forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, the &lt;em&gt;apathy&lt;/em&gt; is found on both ends — within the &lt;em&gt;senrouiva&lt;/em&gt; business owner, who is provided little upward mobility to satisfy ambition beyond local and regional expansion, and within the consumer, who recognises products only within cultural and social dimensions. Neither is conducive to a functioning, fair market on an interregional scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;play&#34;&gt;Play&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Play&lt;/em&gt; is the foundational motivation of most work in Vekllei. There are existential motivators, too — a desire to wield power, or professional legacy — but in many professions it is &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; by which a Vekllei person justifies labour. It is also why work is fiercely protected by petty bureaus and other labour organisations — work is their connection to wider society, and that connection is held sacred in Upen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is through work as &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; that Vekllei is able to justify the employment of children. Financial motivations for work have all but disappeared — in its place, the workplace has to convince people to work. There are few state protections for businesses unable to maintain a workforce, either — it is one of the most common reasons for the shuttering of a company. The boss must convince his workers to stay, and so a total inversion of power has occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In place of money, there is prestige, and in prestige there is myth. Few people have genuine interest in Fordism. Many more are attracted to the hand-crafted furniture of Picco S.p.A., and becoming recognised as a builder of great things. In a sense, a person “acts out” the role of a craftsman, in the same way a person “acts out” the role of a police officer, or “acts out” life as a pilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this system, the childish spirit of recreation, duty and “the adult world” is acted out by millions of Vekllei people each day. Seeds planted by a child play-acting as a farmer continue to grow, and so too does the Vekllei economy feed its population through the intersection of fantasy and labour. At this point it is obvious that &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; is not fantasy at all, but in fact a motivation for labour as genuine as profit. Where it falls short, in hard, disempowering jobs, it is automated and conscripted through the mandatory service system. As it is often described:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The &lt;em&gt;Bureau System&lt;/em&gt; is labour-intensive where wanted, alleviated by industrial machinery where preferred, and automated where necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its wake are states of &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt;, and through play comes a decent framework for living, obvious in the basic satisfaction of the Vekllei people.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Police in Vekllei</title>

  Archived from the original article here
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint red&#34;&gt;
  ❖ &lt;strong&gt;This article&lt;/strong&gt; was featured in &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/newsdesk/bulletin/2020/3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are two regular police organs in Vekllei.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fedecenoayan porits (national police, or &lt;em&gt;venopor&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comoisniyan denporitsa (local police, or &lt;em&gt;cosmopor&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A young &lt;em&gt;venopor&lt;/em&gt; officer stands on the left, in the full street regalia they’re renowned for. Unlike &lt;em&gt;cosmopor&lt;/em&gt;, they often carry machine guns while on patrol and are stationed outside of government buildings, hospitals, train stations, ports, schools and any company managed directly by a bureau, which is a trade organ of national importance. They are special units of special purpose, and supplement the deficiencies of local policing through their training and tactical deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are police insofar as they protect and respond to their community, including through special tactics situations, but are paramilitary in their wider function as a defence force for critical infrastructure. This is reflected in their history, traced cleanly back past independence and the Atomic War to the royal guards and junta federal police of old society, which continue to be reflected in their uniforms and several other ceremonial artefacts, like swords and knee boots. &lt;em&gt;Venopor&lt;/em&gt; is a complex organisation with many different purposes. There are street patrols, pictured here, but there are also intelligence units associated with HO/NI and by extension the military, as well as tactical response teams, bomb squads, search and rescue and most other specialised emergency units outside of the capabilities of any given local police station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is contrast to the &lt;em&gt;cosmopor&lt;/em&gt;, a more conventional police outfit. A &lt;em&gt;cosmopor&lt;/em&gt; officer stands on the right, in standard summer uniform. He carries a radio, revolver and rubber baton for the worst of his duties, and is embedded deep into his local community. &lt;em&gt;Cosmopor&lt;/em&gt; officers traditionally visit and introduce themselves to each house in their beat, and spend far more of their time mediating, counselling and organising than they do making arrests. The autonomy of most Vekllei communities largely spurns petty legal proceedings, and so the &lt;em&gt;cosmopor&lt;/em&gt; are a critical aspect of sundress municipalism, resolving disputes personally and taking custody of a person only when it’s needed. Most crime in Vekllei tends to be emotionally motivated — so it is in this domain that &lt;em&gt;cosmopor&lt;/em&gt; navigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes the &lt;em&gt;cosmopor&lt;/em&gt; especially powerful figures in a Vekllei village or township, but their duties are closely watched. While the Vekllei village may be autonomous, all officers in Vekllei are responsible to a division of &lt;em&gt;venopor&lt;/em&gt; called “officer welfare,” or picosec, which operates autonomously to seek out incompetent or misbehaving police officers, no matter their jurisdiction or status. Where most business in Vekllei has very little in the way of professional behaviour or “work culture”, policing in Vekllei is held to high standards, and they are severely bound by traditions that have become codified as the country has grown. This is a time and place where the children of police often inherit the jobs of their parents, and the constables of a village often have roots that go back centuries. This often makes &lt;em&gt;cosmopor&lt;/em&gt; very respected figures, and their successors and recruits are expected to work for that respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a country that has done away with money as a measure of success, professional legacy is profoundly important in Vekllei. In this inversion of priority, teachers, doctors, pilots, constables and librarians are celebrated. This is not founded in a general egalitarianism, but in fact the precise opposite — a celebration of success and influence, touching the lives of those around them. The glamour, and paycheque, has largely been stripped away. Only the work remains, and so that work has become more important than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Map Key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red&lt;/strong&gt;: Magjet trains, 750km/h&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yellow&lt;/strong&gt;: Bullet trains, 300-400km/h&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orange&lt;/strong&gt;: Regional trains, &amp;lt;150km/h&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brown&lt;/strong&gt;: Local trains, including limited express, &amp;lt;100km/h&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blue&lt;/strong&gt;: National highway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dashed&lt;/strong&gt;: Ferry line&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green&lt;/strong&gt;: tarmacadamed airport&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The largest division of any portion of Vekllei land is the borough&lt;/strong&gt;; a region of varying size and population with common culture, food dependency and economic interest. Anything larger than that is simply Vekllei — they are “one city”, after all, and consider themselves a city-state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been exactly 100 boroughs since 2015. Each is named after the largest city in its region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The smallest borough is &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/bakur&#34;&gt;Bakur&lt;/a&gt;, in Afouismeh, with a population of 7,500 people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The largest is Vekllei proper, in the Capital Region, of 2.4 millions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transit map illustrates all 100 boroughs, Vekllei’s five tallest mountains, its permafrost glaciers and Tzipora’s home in Montre-Lola. Her five largest boroughs — namely Vekllei, Lonne, Adouisneh, Montre and Copette, are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in this simple transit map we can see several truths about the country, like its population bias on the West Coast and the emptiness of the Lava volcanic region. You might recognise a few names there, like Lola in the West (Tzipora’s home with Baron) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/yana&#34;&gt;Yana&lt;/a&gt; in Vekllei’s Ro Highlands (Ayn’s birthplace).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trains are clean, reliable, fast, efficient and safe. They are incorporated under &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/cr65zu/the_people_of_veklleis_railway_plus_dog/&#34;&gt;Vekllei Rail&lt;/a&gt;, owned by the Transport Group Bureau. Using this map, designed for domestic tourists and foreigners, the adequacy of Vekllei’s rail transport is easy to plan around — you can eat breakfast in a cafe in the seaside town of Mumen, and hike before midday on the glacial slopes of Askayoisn. Since there are no tickets or costs, there are no excuses for not visiting relatives in the country, now that transport is now a trivial inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each borough is represented in Vekllei’s parliament by an elected representative. These representatives wield extraordinarily disproportionate power — the representative for Callaisn, for example, represents hundreds of times more people than the representative for Tanger, but both have the same vote. This is because boroughs are not just representative of their populations, but also their environments, industry and other social organs otherwise unable to vote. It is important to keep in mind that Upen (and consequently, policy) recognises the landscape itself as the sovereign organ of the country, and so in this sense it has its own interests and projections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, representatives act in an advisory, nonpartisan role in government, voting rarely in an auxiliary role to the professionalised, elected legislature. Vekllei has a strictly constitutional parliament, and the economy largely prohibits interference. In this sense, the parliament is both partially undemocratic in its inefficiency and apolitical in its orientation as a sort of civil service bureau, managing state affairs and reacting to pressures and the long-term aims outlined in the 2015 constitution. In the Vekllei mindset, the “government” is more or less another bureau, no different or particularly more interesting than the Transport Group Bureau. The trains, at least, have a tangible impact on their daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How appropriate, then, that this transit map produced in the summer months of 2076 combines both monuments of society. It also offers a glimpse of a larger, documented country not necessarily revealed in piecemeal story posts.&lt;/p&gt;

  Archived from the original article here
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint red&#34;&gt;
  ❖ &lt;strong&gt;This article&lt;/strong&gt; was featured in &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/newsdesk/bulletin/2020/2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei, legendarily, does not use circulate currency&lt;/strong&gt;. Goods and services are moved and offered arbitrarily, provided amply in abundance. Anything that is not abundant is manufactured and distributed directly under the control of a bureau, which is a trade organ responsible to the affairs of the country. At no point do coins or paper currency change hands in the day-to-day affairs of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, Vekllei is usually described as “moneyless” — yet it does in fact have a currency. The Vekllei Kroner, or “Crown,” is hundreds of years old, and Vekllei still operates a mint for currency. At any time, a Vekllei person can write to the National Mint and order a set of coins, like the ones pictured above. So what is going on here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Kroner has not been used since 2022, after the last village in Stochi returned coinage to the Mint, it continues to exist to this day as a gold-backed currency in the International Market, through which Vekllei trades with other countries. The physical coins, produced mostly as a novelty in the tradition of &lt;em&gt;mayaesdiou&lt;/em&gt; (medallions, or small metal pieces commonly collected and given in Vekllei), are a physical coinage of the International Market. The coins also operate as a form of bullion, or wealth reserve, since each coin is worth exactly its face value in gold. Since the International Market is completely closed and independent of the domestic economy, its value is controlled directly by the so-called Government Bank. It is one of the few gold-backed currencies in a developed nation today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further complicate things, there are actually two different Kroner in Vekllei. There is the &lt;strong&gt;Vekllei Kroner&lt;/strong&gt;, which represents the International Market, but there is also a seperate &lt;strong&gt;Government/State Kroner&lt;/strong&gt;, which is not minted and used only as an investment mechanism, backed by government &amp;ldquo;white bonds&amp;rdquo; which are usually measures of labour-hours or refined materials. It is, in a sense, a fiat currency alongside a gold-backed currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They exist independently because they are used for two seperate purposes. The Vekllei Kroner is used a wealth reserve and bullion, and also represents the collective wealth of the Vekllei people. Each citizen, in theory, is entitled to an equal share of the Government Bank, although it can only be withdrawn as currency in specific circumstances. Vekllei also holds substantial amounts of foreign currency in the Government Bank and Vekllei Kroner, which is used to invest and stabilise holdings and capital in foreign countries. The Government Kroner, on the other hand, is used as an investment mechanism abroad, usually in support of infrastructure. It is also used to acquire foreign currencies through investment in foreign capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite having two currencies, neither the &amp;ldquo;Vekllei Crown&amp;rdquo; or the &amp;ldquo;Government Crown&amp;rdquo; are used in the domestic economy in Vekllei, which is autonomous and not subject to a central bank. So it is that Vekllei’s currency is both little more than a novelty and essential to the function of the country in a world still ruled by money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the coinage depicted above — 8 coins are minted in Vekllei today.&lt;/strong&gt; They were designed in 2015, in the year of independence. They represent eight core values in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “small crowns,” worth 1VK and 10VK respectively, represent fraternity and liberty, two founding elements of the Vekllei constitution. The 50VK coin is plated in silver and has a small ruby inset. Rubies are used to represent energy, in this case, the vitality of the spirits, which dominate Upen and the Vekllei landscape. The 100, 200, 500 and 1,000VK coins represent different landscapes of the country. As a volcanic island nation, the ocean (100) and landscape (200) coins are fairly straightforward. The humanity coin (500) represents the Vekllei people and ancestry — note how humans are placed alongside other natural forces. The flower coin (1,000VK) represents the flowers of the country, which are important spiritually and have formed part of the Vekllei identity. Vekllei has the most flowers per capita in the world. The final, larger 10,000VK coin represents the previous seven together, as a total sum of Vekllei landscape and identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer Tzipora’s question — a bottle of fizzy drink cost about 2VK in the waning days of coinage in the early 2020s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint red&#34;&gt;
  ❖ &lt;strong&gt;This article&lt;/strong&gt; was featured in &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/newsdesk/bulletin/2020/2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The village of Montre-Lola&lt;/strong&gt; is home to about 400 people in its entirety, a stone’s throw from the Aisyo borough. Each morning, however, the population swells as 300 children from tiny villages in both Aisyo and Montre take a fast tram to the Montre-Lola Area School No. 2, a district school raising all ages of local youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many Vekllei villages, Montre-Lola’s history is complex and has origin stories in both viking-inuit settlement as well as less sentimental government programmes that flourished after the atomic war. By historical accounts, Montre-Lola has been inhabited since at least 1500CE. By contemporaneous records, however, it was established as a village in land reform during the 1960s and revitalised by the building of the area school in 2057.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Montre-Lola features many civic objects common to Vekllei villages — a nondenominational place of worship (in this case, a historical Catholic church), a constabulary, a doctor, an auto/tractor pool, a general store, a station platform, and a village hall. A map of the village centre is dominated by the Area School, built in an Edunewda style, which features many new facilities that distinguish it from smaller, 20th-century schools. It’s a good place to grow up; where farmland and earnest modernity collide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Montre-Lola is most relevant as the residence of Tzipora Desmoisnes, the world’s oldest person and one of the first people to be diagnosed with Gregori-Heitzfeld Syndrome. She works as a librarian in both the Montre-Lola Area School and the Montre-Lola Library &amp;amp; Archives, spending most of her 12-hour workday in either of these institutions. She commutes via fast trams, which arrive automatically at the two platforms in Montre-Lola every half-hour and continue out into the surrounding farms. This means that, if she sets her watch right, she can step outside her front door and arrive at the school library in under ten minutes. This journey is marked in red on the map above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominated by farmland, Montre-Lola is communal and more traditionally ‘anarchist’ in flavour than Vekllei’s urban boroughs, which are obscured by convenience. As charming as it is suffocating, the community is very close-knit and made up of all sorts — smart educated young men and women sent from Montre to teach, as well as farming families that have resided here for centuries. Life moves slower and people know each other. When the school hosts its cross-country race each year, nearly every person in the village is out to watch it. After all, it takes a village to raise a child.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Oa-Class Battlecruiser</title>

  ❖ &lt;strong&gt;This article&lt;/strong&gt; was featured in &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/newsdesk/bulletin/2020/2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei’s defensive military posture has&lt;/strong&gt;, in doctrine and arms development, limited its ability to meaningfully project power outside of the Atlantic. As an island nation with a large and multifaceted naval armada, the Oa-Class Battlecruiser is the heart of her armed forces, as the flagship of her fleets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where U.S. doctrine places carriers offensively in the structure of its ship-groups, the Vekllei Navy is considerably more Soviet in its employ of carriers as primarily defensive air-bases to exercise sovereignty over her far-flung territories and island possessions. Oa-class Battlecruisers are notable as hybrid carrier-battleships, and feature a diagonal jetway with capacity for carrier-type naval jets (almost indistinguishable in the illustration above) and a variety of VTOL aircraft, which are common by the 2050s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First built in the 2050s by the sprawling National Naval Arsenal (located on Vekllei’s Far East coast, close to the foundries that pour her iron), 12 Oa-Class Battlecruisers are in service in the 2070s. They carry heavy fission reactors built by bureau monopoly General Reactor, supplemented by a gas-turbine generator, as is standard on all Vekllei-built nuclear vessels. Her unusual serpentine funnel is characteristic of Vekllei’s navy, and is a distinguishing feature of their naval design language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her hulking superstructure and massive 15-inch fore guns recall the capital battleships of yesteryear, but she is a thoroughly modern battlecruiser with contemporary armament and electrics for combat and fleet administration. Named after Vekllei’s National flower, these Battlecruisers are the third-largest vessels in the navy and are multifunctional by design, often operated as strategic and operational platforms to support Vekllei’s large defensive armadas that patrol the North Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is armed with two triple-barrelled 15-inch shore guns that can be loaded with a variety of shells including nuclear payloads, silos for guided missiles, and specialised guns and missile platforms for anti-ship, submarine and satellite warfare. Her powerful communications array and sensors are positioned 80 meters above the surface for the benefit of radar and subsurface monitoring. She can also support up to 12 standard carrier jets at one time, or 16 individual helijets/VTOL craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei has larger battlecruisers (the so-called super-battlecruisers match her height and are nearly twice her length) and much larger carriers, but the displacement of the vessel was never a priority. Vekllei’s naval architecture prioritises mobility and capability in their capital ships, and so the Oa-class vessels represent many intersecting vertices of Vekllei’s naval doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atlantic Salmon was the best in the world, and Vekllei had a lot of it. Ocean-going fishing boats brought their haul to Ro, where they cruised wide postwar canals and unloaded tonnes of shiny, bright salmon into processing plants. If a new factory was built, so too was a canal or a railroad. Nothing was trucked. Fish was traded fresh in markets or turned into emulsifiers and fertiliser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The canals were worked heavily, and few fishing vessels were incorporated. The vast majority of Vekllei’s fishing fleet was owned by the people that worked them, trading with the Sea Office. From a &lt;em&gt;quaisiosn&lt;/em&gt; or “canal park” you might see a dozen vessels in an hour. Some were run-down prewar things limping out to the shallow coasts, while others were nuclear-powered salmon trawlers designed for the storms of the Atlantic. On the northern coast, the bigger boats were reinforced as ice-breakers. Fish was one of the few meats in the Vekllei diet that wasn’t grown in an industrial laboratory, a fact reflected in the scale of its infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canals are good for a city, and are good for the heart. Tzipora would take long walks in the morning along the Wellington Canal to where it met Touismah, then follow it to where it circled back into Lola. She would figure out what she was doing with her life as the boats departed for the day’s catch. She never much liked salmon, but she liked the boats. They were an island country, and their futures and pasts met in the sea — where it churned and swelled in their dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In an unprecedented event,&lt;/strong&gt; during Vekllei’s 50th Sea Festival since Independence in 2065, an 8 kiloton fission bomb was sunk to a depth of 150 meters and detonated at midday. It was an incredible sight on a day so clear you could see the gentle curve of the earth where it met the horizon. A flash of light and a spray dome surged outwards into the quiet Atlantic, which was broken apart by plumes that formed a column of water that climbed high into the sky. The lateral plumes, the “mushroom”, reached far across the horizon, forming thick clouds that would begin to rain into the sea.  From the coast, fifteen kilometres away, a warm light bathed observers and was followed a moment later by a bang that deeply shook you and those around you. In this instance it seemed that the whole universe was their domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plume would rise nearly 1,500 metres into the sky before falling away. It stayed that way for a while. Almost nobody moved for a long time after — people stood on cars and tables. You could only recognise the scale and the feeling of the fission bomb by seeing it in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed incomprehensible, in the face of such a device, that wars could still be fought at all. What use is a battleship in the face of a cloud like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora and Elise, covering the detonation for Lola 7th School’s student newspaper, found themselves not quite sure what to say. Elise wrote, captioning Tziproa’s photograph, “The Independence bomb filled our sky with our sea for a half-hour on Sunday, and with it rose the thoughts of every person in attendance, who considered the awesome power now shouldered by each of us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was indeed some sense that they had contributed to the bomb, and that they had more at their disposal. Few would fly the planes to deliver them, and fewer still had the brains to develop them, but participating in a nuclear century contributed to, in some effect, a nuclear horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Winter Uniforms in Vekllei</title>

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When I paint Vekllei, I usually depict the warmer months&lt;/strong&gt;. Hems are shorter, days are longer, and the destabilisation of the world’s climate has only benefited these arctic people. At the gift end of the Vekllei low pressure system, Scandinavian misery has become Mediterranean pleasure, with warm summers and a mild Autumn and Spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, by late October, the the earth is hard with cold and the days are short. The world may be warmer, but Vekllei’s polar latitude is unchanged, and in the depths of winter the sun only rises for an hour a day. These are Vekllei’s “moon months”, and they announce some of the most important spiritual festivals in Upen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although school hours are reduced in winter, life carries on and Vekllei fashion becomes traditionally utilitarian. Tzipora has poor circulation and cold hands even in the warm months, and by November she’s traded the skirt and gi for traditional &lt;em&gt;rouisha&lt;/em&gt; trousers and a cloak. &lt;em&gt;Rouisha&lt;/em&gt;, like a lot of traditional clothing, have origins in agriculture and are characterised by a loose, baggy fit and insulated lining. Cobian is wearing a heavy wool sack-type dress, which is worn like an apron over other clothing. Winter brings forth “petticoat society” literally. Note the leather &lt;em&gt;plate&lt;/em&gt; on her shoulder, to which her &lt;em&gt;christmas aiguillette&lt;/em&gt; is attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, Winter’s revival of traditional clothing and customs further evidences its practice as the most traditional season of the year. Although the warm calendar flourishes with the futurist sympathies of a modernist Vekllei, not even the atomic age has been able to dispense with its hard-worked pragmatism developed in a millennia of bitter cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baron had inherited the apartment&lt;/strong&gt; from his uncle, who passed in the year following his parents. It was in a mixed residential-industrial neighbourhood, adjacent to a canvas factory. Out back was a rivulet, which roared in the long rainstorms of early April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each January, the Colour Bureau of the Architecture Assembly announces the year’s colours, and tradition in mainstream architecture and interior design is to incorporate the announced palettes, which usually contain a hundred or so colours. His uncle’s apartment had been built and furnished in 2031, and so it had a #2031 Colour Profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, it was a very conventional apartment in the Vekllei tradition. It had a sauna and bath in the wetroom, a bidet, a sunken living room and a bread oven. In others, it was more peculiar. The apartment was bizarrely allocated across three levels. You alighted the entrance light well into a sunken living space, then climbed back up into the kitchen. The main living room and master bedroom were another step above the kitchen. Adjacent to the main living area was a closet and study, which overlooked the entrance from a half-meter mezzanine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was in this study that Tzipora set up shop when she arrived in March 2063. Baron had been reluctant to take her even provisionally, not least because it would mean searching for a new apartment in his busy return period after being abroad for ten years. Tzipora, however, had lived in a dormitory for much of her life and had settled in the alcove once she acquired a dresser screen. She refused outright the master bedroom, which sparked a sleepy agoraphobia. By the time Baron had made other accomodations, Tzipora had entrenched herself in the neighbourhood and had developed a severe sentimentality about the apartment and its rivulet, and so that was where he lived for the rest of his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, Tzipora had a strange kinship with the apartment. Baron sealed himself off in the master bedroom each night, but she never left the main living space. It was warm in there, especially in the flickering light of the enormous oven and fireplace, and when she moved the screen aside in the morning her little corner became part of the living area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had a lot of good memories of that apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After three days in Ada, Tzipora set off towards Mt Miya. She made good time, and after three hours had happened upon the shoulders of the bright Volouisnesnkull Glacier. It was about here that she heard a morbid industrial siren, echoing up the valleys from far away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first she thought it might have come from Ada, since Boya Chemical had a large plant there, but as she lay out her things for lunch she heard the distinct whine of a turbojet. It grew louder, and deeper, until a National Fire VTOL tanker roared across the sky, swirling powdered snow on nearby peaks as it arced across the glacier. It was close enough to catch the sun ablaze in the reflection of its glass nosecone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She later learned that lava streams had opened up not far from where she’d hiked, and had been making their way towards a geothermal power plant nestled in the highlands. In the evening, on her way back, she saw a long line of fire supertankers and pumpers spraying water in beautiful arcs, where it caught hisses from bright streams of melted rock. It was a common enough sight in Vekllei — hoses were the only defence you could reasonably make against the the fracturing earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it was not often you saw jets flying so low. It was funny to her that even the barren glaciers were tamed in this age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;East of Montre, West of Tjornes, waits a rare sight among Vekllei’s hard igneous slopes&lt;/strong&gt; — a crown of gentle sedimentary cliffs packed with ruddy sandstone, which melt glacially into the sea chasing blue-sky bergs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora was, at the time, making her way on foot from Montre-Lola to Ada, which was a coastal town in the North-East known for its luxurious health spas. Tzipora was not much interested in health, but she was interested in walking, and she made a pilgrimage along the coast every few years to make sense of the world. She was going whichaway and destined for nowhere in particular. Tzipora was very much Baron’s daughter, in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had stopped to see the Red Cliffs forty kilometres out from Tjornes when she saw a cruiser of the constabulary parked unusually by the shore. The constabulary were not local police — they were a national outfit tasked with policing government and “bureau business”. You found them at power plants, outside universities, guarding the prime minister and providing bodies for HO/NI (Home Office at National Intelligence) when they needed doors kicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora was not the sort of girl to be intimidated by a badge, and she wandered innocently to the shore where she found the cruiser empty. She looked across a beach of black sand and saw some sort of operation playing out — there was a gun boat not too far from the shore, and a police hydrofoil beached on the sand. She counted maybe a dozen officers. She wondered if they’d arrest her if she walked down to see what was happening. She climbed onto the hood of the cruiser to get a better look. Perhaps it was immigrants — or smugglers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It only took another moment to spot the smashed crates broken across the rocks before she knew what was going on. She was witnessing the dying days of the countercultural decade, and its chemical fuel was now smashed open before her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2070s were a wild time for the so-called “pink years” in Vekllei, and for the first time in Tzipora’s memory she started seeing “pleasure drugs” on the streets. There had always been plenty of sin carrying on in Vekllei, even in her early days — hallucinogenics, alcohol, and synthesised highs were legal and easy. But you didn’t see much of the exotic stuff, which grew in a better climate. Hash, coke, H — it was all underground stuff for personal use. These drugs were listed among many others in the class-A import prohibition orders, which made them hard to find and illegal to import. These were “pleasure drugs” — the Vekllei phrase for overseas narcotics that didn’t have a place in Upen or a preexisting cultural history. Comparatively, they were just ‘for pleasure’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H for heroin was a big news item for a long time, and with it you had one the largest moral panics in modern Vekllei cultural memory. Crackdowns came soon after. Tzipora found it difficult to describe the feeling of the time. It was a new generation — one she didn’t belong to, despite her appearance — and she didn’t have much sympathy for hedonists. They might tell her different, but she never thought the pink years were about much more than feeling good all of the time. She wondered if she was growing old and grumpy inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wondered how the crates had got there. Had the coast guard sunk another smugger? You heard about the navy firing shots in the news sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruined with seawater and picked over by constables, the chemical feast of Vekllei’s pink years died with the times. Tzipora wouldn’t miss it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stepped off the hood and set off back towards the road, where a warm inn and hot food awaited her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tomorrow&lt;/strong&gt;: 2020 Complete Guide to Vekllei&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up in the ro, the Vekllei flower-tundra home to spirits and people alike, green slopes and igneous monument make an ample crucible for myth and magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out here, there was a very keen sense of place and purpose. “Landscape” was neither revered nor ignored, since it did not exist here altogether. Every hill, rock and tree was taken at face value in its full honesty, with commodity dead and modernism suppressed. The place supported human life, and human life supported place. It was intuitive symbiosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora’s house was built by the hands of her friends with wood from the forest nearby and concrete from Adouisneh. They built her a fireplace big enough to keep her loft warm and the bread hot. She was a small girl and had to split her wood with a pedal saw, which she fed wood from her journeys for kindling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She cycled to the village a kilometre down the road each morning, where she worked in the district library. People from villages nested in the hills and valleys made the commute here, to see films and borrow books. It was funny to her that the scope of the books were so worldly and comprehensive, and that the lives here were so small and pleasant. Living like this, the whole world seemed like a distant curiosity, far removed from their concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/eqi5tr/the_girl_and_the_sublime/&#34;&gt;Much like the inversion of the sublime&lt;/a&gt;, Tzipora found an inversion of priority in Montre-Lola too. Time and space seemed to collapse in on themselves here, and all abstractions and petty knowledge was squashed. All that existed was the immediate relationship between herself and her surrounds — the old path and tractor, the flowers and drumlins — each heartbeat after the next, life and death adjacent, the future and past as quiet as the present. In places like this you could live a thousand years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tzipora stood astride the bicycle luggage rack, and looked at her best friend Moise. She smiled at him, and looked to the town before them, and squinted at the clouds rising over the Atlantic horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a warm late summer and there was salt in the air. Pebbles made better swimmers than Tzipora, but from up here she could admire the coast and fill her heart with the breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She looked at the road ahead, and thought about what they’d eat for tea. It was all good from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had a thought that she would remember this moment for the rest of her life.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Ou Hydroburo Office</title>

&lt;p&gt;Almost any other &lt;em&gt;venrouive&lt;/em&gt; national bureau is more glamorous than Vekllei’s &lt;strong&gt;Hydroburo&lt;/strong&gt;, but that fact does not detract from the organ’s critical function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the sophisticated age of robotics demands the incredible yield of nuclear fission, a significant minority of Vekllei’s electricity is produced by hydroelectric dams, which are jointly operated by the Thunderburo and Hydroburo. Hydroelectricity appeals to the common Vekllei person strategically and culturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, where the nature of fission demands operational stability and exceptionally well-trained personnel that might be vulnerable to nuclear strikes, estimates by the War Department suggest the country’s hydroelectric dams would survive a nuclear strike, and would be operational shortly after a war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, hydroelectric dams appeal to the Upen intuition. Vekllei’s principle of &lt;em&gt;dumousiantopet&lt;/em&gt; (beautiful and seperate) is epitomised by the concept of a dam, which modifies its environment to benefit its local community, but also transforms a landscape with a permanence associated with natural phenomena. It is a tremendous structure, monumental in size and quiet in operation. Its analogue modernity and gentle nature appeal to Vekllei’s deindustrial spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depicted here is the Ou Hydroburo Office, located outside of &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/ou/&#34;&gt;Ou&lt;/a&gt; in the Vekllei West Ro Highlands and serviced by a special express train that arrives in the morning and departs at the end of the day. Many townsfolk in Ou are employed in operation of the dam, either through the Thunder or Hydroburos. It is also the site of a small Vekllei National University laboratory which examines the dam environment and trains its staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site is early Newda in style, built soon after the Atomic War, and is remarkable for its striking water tower and pump house. These pumps draw water from the reservoir into pipes tunnelled into the surrounding mountains, at which point gravity carries it all the way to &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/ou/&#34;&gt;Ou&lt;/a&gt;, Yana, and Vekllei proper’s own reservoirs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AB/NI’s Spectres of Violence</title>

  Archived from the original article here
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Americas Bureau at National Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; (AB/NI), a semiautonomous organ of the covert operations council of the War Department, is recognised as the busiest of the continental bureaus. There is a lot to be busy with — the Dallas Secession, the Brazilian invasion of Bolivia, the Dallas nuclear lend-lease, and the reliability of Venezuelan oil production are all of some concern to Vekllei, and so AB/NI proactively has fingers in those pies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AB/NI foreign operations are provocative and direct, often guiding or outright employing shadow contractors, criminals, mercenary groups and political action groups. This is in the spirit of Vekllei’s concentric security concerns, which are benefited by the destabilisation of major powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequently implicated and rarely rarely held accountable, AB/NI soaks up hard men returning from the previous decade of vicious fighting in Asia and puts them to work in coat and tie as servants of the Vekllei intelligence community. These include superficially respectable, decent men like Baron Desmoisnes, but also many of those whose violent tendencies and undiagnosed psychological problems are kept isolated from domestic life by their disposal in the regional bureuas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora first met &lt;strong&gt;Wihle “Willy” Tesmehsnoisen&lt;/strong&gt; in Baron’s orbit shortly after her arrival in Vekllei in 2063. She immediately liked him. His filthy ragged hair and stache were at odds with his business attire, and his short, sharp movements carried a threat of violence. His incongruity radiated freakish charm and power — the sort of person Tzipora liked. He thought Tzipora was the funniest thing he’d ever seen, and not just for her good sense of humour. To him, her diagnosis wasn’t worth much more than a good laugh. “You haven’t changed a bit,” he’d say every time he saw her. She liked that. He also faked an American accent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He worked as an operative at AB/NI, and she only saw him occasionally. As far as she could tell, he was not particularly close with Baron — Baron was not particularly close with anyone but her and maybe Ayn — but she thought Wihle respected him. They’d both been boys in the Asian war, and he’d clearly had a place in Baron’s history, no doubt in shadowy work to which Tzipora was not privy. When Tzipora performed in the school play as Witch #2, Wihle was in the audience with Baron and Ayn, clapping and stomping his feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where he’s from?” She asked Baron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He said he’s from California, but that’s a lie. I don’t know where he comes from.” Like most of their conversations in his office, he was looking at his work and did not look up to answer her questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“California,” she said, and something about it — the spirit, if not the truth — made sense. She asked, “what does he do at work?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Shit all,” Baron said, and that was the end of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2072, Wihle was killed in an altercation with his wife. The unsolved disappearances of several Americans went with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Willy’s loud anarchism was contrasted by &lt;strong&gt;Jiro Kondō’s&lt;/strong&gt; obsequious professionalism. Here, lo, was another AB/NI contradiction — a man dressed like a gangster with the disposition of a well-paid civil servant. Jiro had started out as a merchant navy sailor on old diesel ships in the Sino Crisis, and after the war had found work with Vekllei’s Japanese Embassy as a double agent. Soon he’d been granted citizenship and recognised as a capable regional advisor for OB/NI (Oriental Bureau at National Intelligence) and met Baron through Vekllei’s work monitoring U.S.-Japan relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although many Vekllei staff in the provincial HO/NI (Home Office at National Intelligence) dismissed him as an unremarkable “import” from the East — a pretentious Japanese bureaucrat — Jiro was a fascinating character. Generally, men who’d actually seen action were unremarkable and gentle like Baron, or easy-going and irreverent like Wihle, but Jiro was neither. He was a very intense, focused man who volunteered almost any information about himself freely, though he was not a conversationalist. Baron shrugged decades of his life away in the most innocent of questions, but a simple “did you ever kill somebody?” elicited a frank, disarming admission from Jiro:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes… In 2056. A Korean… He was monitoring a man of interest to me… and the man in question was in a very delicate situation. I shot the Korean in his apartment. This was in Osaka.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was not a warm man, but he remembered every occasion of her life and delivered small gifts. Tzipora loved gifts, the the care of the gesture in a decommodifiied society, and so she reciprocated the gesture to him several times a year. So it was that Jiro’s birthday gifts consisted only of the scarves knitted by the daughter of his boss. He never married,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were others at AB/NI whom Tzipora liked, not least of which the fabulous and loving Ayn, but few typified the eccentricity and violence associated with the regional bureaus more than Wihle and Jiro. It was a glimpse of the “real” world. Away from her Vekllei language lessons, and the superficiality of her classmates, were the spectres of real danger, mental illness and genuine intrigue. That connection, as tenuous and unjustifiable as it was, was very important to her.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ghosts of Taiwan in the Yana Lakehouse</title>

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By 2047, Vekllei had a lot of broken men&lt;/strong&gt;. Tens of thousands had alighted troop ships at the end of the War of Taiwan, only to find that pieces of their lives had unravelled overseas. Hardy, bronze-skinned boys were left with their ghosts, and those ghosts introduced them to drinking, and brawling, and suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the Birmingham Convention and the second round of the Commonwealth War Trials, a young and recently defeated Vekllei nation was chained to a conflict that was beginning to fester in East Asia. They didn’t want to be there, but that’s what happens when you lose a war. So they became &amp;ldquo;Whites&amp;rdquo; — as opposed to &amp;ldquo;reds&amp;rdquo;, or communists, they supposed. But it was also apparent that they were anglos in an oriental war. They fought begrudgingly alongside the Taiwanese, American GIs, Brits, and some Australians. At one point there were more white foreigners in the Datong district in Taipei than Chinese — that’s modern war, Baron supposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was not a friend of any People’s Republic, but the Kuomintang wankers were off the rails. The high schools had closed down and they’d taken the boys and put them in uniform. They sent those boys south from their provisional headquarters in Wulai, down as far as Yuchi where they rounded up the smartest-looking people and shot them. In the Five Days Terror, Taipei glowed in the light of a hundred thousand books turned to ash in bonfires. They were spotting Mao on street corners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind any KMT officer there was a Joint Intelligence Bureau slug, and behind the slug was some CIA motherfucker. Vekllei soldiers, who were ostensibly nonaligned but were in no position to argue, took orders from these clowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People’s Republic had control over a decent part of Kaohsiung and the whites were terrified of rumours of Red Chinese in the mountains on the West Coast. The communists did not have the benefit of a century of support from the Americans, and most of the boys they killed were ill-equipped and skinny. At night you could hear the distant booms of gunfire in the sea between the ROC and Xiamen. At this time Atomic shit was still restricted to naval warfare. Occasionally an old diesel ship would go up, and you’d see it from the shore. Those fireballs looked like they touched satellites overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baron had a clinical, empty side to him in which he stored a lot of his pain. He had done unspeakable things, and had merely forgotten them or parcelled them away so that they could not be coherently retrieved. That sort of conscience lands you with spooks; for the rest of the boys coming home from Taiwan, their lives had ended with the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem of dead vets and criminal heroes became such that the War Bureau, equipped with new research on shell-shock, established a series of hospitals across the country that isolated and gave time for these boys to come to terms with what they did and what they saw. They were sanatoriums, in a sense — you took a train into the highlands, and you came back when you were ready. A lot of boys found it difficult to be around people who didn’t understand them. At the hospitals, called &lt;em&gt;ouismaindesdenyo&lt;/em&gt; or “Care Homes”, they could be around those people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baron would visit people occasionally at the &lt;em&gt;Yana&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;ouismaindesdenya.&lt;/em&gt; Tzipora would go with him. She thought it was because her being there made him feel less like a patient. She did not know if the people he visited were comrades, friends or if he was simply fulfilling a duty as an ex-officer. He never made it clear to her. She spent time on the lake shore painting and thinking. At dusk the sky would glow, and she would think about what the hell it was she was doing with her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, she was a patient at &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/yana&#34;&gt;Yana&lt;/a&gt; too — after all, like these men, she’d done and seen terrible things. She’d seen the other side of life’s coin, in a way. When she underwent &lt;em&gt;sumoirnesdenen&lt;/em&gt; (ego death) years later, she thought it felt similar to that moderated, clinical idea of trauma — like she had crossed a rubicon, and had been exposed to some secret about violence and death, and that every part of her life was now framed in relation to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She never claimed to be like the boys at Yana, because she wasn’t. But she knew what it was like to enter domesticity and never feel at home in it. She was lucky; she had Baron. She wondered about those boys who married before they left. She wondered where those brides were now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a week, they would travel downstream from the highlands and leave Yana behind. There the memories would stay, until their return the following season.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Montre, City of Learning</title>

  Archived from the original article here
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Montre Prefecture of the Vekllei city-state is among the most learned urban landscapes in the world. In the days of the monarchy, it had been an unremarkable city, home to the empire’s submarine fleet. It was obliterated by bombs in the war, and the &amp;ldquo;new Montre&amp;rdquo; that has blossomed in its place is nourished by its ashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the most prolific creatures in Vekllei’s academic elite, including prestigious folk like physicist Thomas Weihennet and Chief Engineer of General Reactor Maya Ou, almost all of them were educated in Montre. It is home to Vekllei National University, and also to the more bohemian Montre School of Economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t the ivy or sandstone that makes Montre remarkable, however. Montre’s status at the forefront of learning is found amidst the dozens of small unorthodox, nonconformist, radical and avant-garde schools that have proliferated in Petticoat Society. Any chump can wiggle his way into Vekllei National University — but only twelve students a year can study under renowned architect Urian Reddennen, who teaches “Sick Newda” architectural ideology to talented young architects as young as fourteen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora herself has a brief encounter with the &lt;em&gt;uoismendainda&lt;/em&gt;, or “underground schools”. While working anonymously as central mailer of &lt;em&gt;Kid Comix&lt;/em&gt;, an underground APA (amateur press association, a sort of decentralised magazine created and possessed only by contributors), she made contact with Sgt. Salt, AKA cartoonist Darren Heidoismen. It was only years later that he discovered that editor “Squick” was Tzipora Desmoisnes — none other than Vekllei’s first Gregori Baby. After meeting her in Montre-Lola, her quiet provincial lifestyle in stark contrast with his fame as a comics author, she agreed to work for him at his studio in Montre, mostly as a colourist for serialised strips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her apprenticeship only lasted six months, and she wouldn’t return to comics after her stint in the biz, but she kept in close contact with both Heidoismen and her own roots in the underground comix scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is in these schools, taught by auteurs against curriculums of fancy, that much of Vekllei’s cultural fabric is woven today. It is not particularly sentimental — in fact, it is ruthlessly modern, facing deindustrialisation as the liberation of artist and worker alike. Uoismendainda are the spirit of Vekllei’s postwar resurgence, and their concentration in Montre makes the prefecture a clear choice for youth looking for answers in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ego Death and Upen&#39;s Spiritual Rebirth</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Beach was a small part of herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another stroke on the Hell Screen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She washed ashore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two dollars were in the sand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hound had come here to rest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damp cotton touched green water&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She thought of what she was doing here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of what the night invoked&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot sand met a rising wind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It happened again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She realised&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was not a single dog left to fight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the whitecap constellations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sumoirnesdenen&lt;/em&gt; or “facing self abolishment” is better described as ego death. It has a long history in Upen, Vekllei’s nondenominational animism, which employs hallucinogenic drugs in service of spiritual revitalisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of sumoirnesdenen is not to better prepare a mind for a sincere spiritual pursuit, but to propel the psyche into an objective, disassociated space to clarify the pressures and deceptions in life. It is in a sense a psychological and spiritual rebirth, if performed with an experienced guide in a controlled environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora Desmoisnes, Vekllei’s first Gregori Baby, engaged in sumoirnesdenen in 2076 at the age of 29 against her father’s advice. She had concerns about having a “bad trip” because of lingering psychological concerns, but decided to proceed after years of depression. She engaged in the trip with the help of an Upen minister, as is standard practice in Vekllei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice is celebrated in two parts — first, a period of ego-death under influence of mushrooms (although synthetic drugs are often used today, especially in urban areas), and second comes a sober reassessment of priority (called &lt;em&gt;maloidenen&lt;/em&gt; or self-worship) that aims to rebuild the person positively while the memory of the open soul is still vivid. This is done largely through scripture and controlled socialising, and is celebrated, much like a birthday, as a milestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Tzipora’s sumoirnesdenen experience was positive and provided important clarity in a very lonely time of her life, she soon after began recalling dreams from her early months in Vekllei for the first time in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were nasty-feeling images, encumbered with insecurities and a dark paranoia. Never a strong swimmer, she found herself washed up on beaches, meeting dead acquaintances, and grimacing as her waterlogged nightshirt chafed her shoulders. It began to disturb sleep. She wondered if sumoirnesdenen had exposed a clearer subconscious filled with a sinister, more accurate, depiction of her past and future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had, however, provided a clear frame of mind to understand herself in the context of the universe. The dreams began to fade. Her ego quickly reasserted her place in the world — indeed, it had never really disappeared. It provided her with a glimpse at the other side of the coin, and it put her heart at peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back after a break. I&amp;rsquo;m relearning how to write worldbuilding posts. I hope you enjoyed, there&amp;rsquo;s more on the way  &amp;ndash; Hobart.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I pick up some larger projects, my posts here will slow down a little bit. That&amp;rsquo;s okay &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m still easy to track down and get in touch with, and you guys will still see the best stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I post a lot of sketches to &lt;a href=&#34;https://discord.gg/dCE6vSU&#34;&gt;the Vekllei Discord&lt;/a&gt;, which is something between a fan club and a social club for the project. Check the #utopia channel for little artworks like this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re paying me money to make posts, that&amp;rsquo;s where you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got a few projects on the go at the moment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The website is still be developed, complete with a comprehensive wiki of all the latest canon. I stopped working on it for a while as I approached the limits of my HTML ability, but I&amp;rsquo;ve enlisted someone smarter to help me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The comic is making tentative progress but I hope to release some pages here eventually. It&amp;rsquo;s a long-term project that needs to be started right &amp;ndash; in the meantime, I can prepare as well as I can for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Vekllei card game is well under way. 150/180 cards are sorted, and then it&amp;rsquo;s all a matter of doing the art for them. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be pretty great!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple other things, like animation experiments, storyboards for a trailer, and so on are also burning in the background. I just hate to see so much time go between posts on this place :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, feel free to hang out here and keep on keeping on. I&amp;rsquo;m on the upward trend out of a serious creative slump that&amp;rsquo;s lasted the last three months, and it feels good to be working again. Let me know if you&amp;rsquo;ve got any questions about&amp;hellip; anything, or this picture specifically!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind regards,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Tzipora moved to study English and Vekllei literature at the university of Montre in 2075, she had to walk from the little home where she lived to Montre-Lola’s old concrete platform, which facilitated a single electric railcar each way, each day. If she was feeling lively, she could make it to the platform in a half hour. On the days where she dreaded sighting her plimsolls in the shoebox, it might take forty-five minutes. She made this trip six days a week for five years, because that was the price of acquiring two degrees at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, the walk had been a welcome canvas of boredom. If the weather was good, it could even invoke the sublime. A row of gnarled old pines, planted by dead men, formed rank beside the dirt road. In the spring, the flower-tundras flashed colour through the waving pine needles as the breeze rolled through, which cooled her dreadful perspiration. She felt a very strong kinship with the Earth then, and she steadied the pace of her breaths, and she tasted sweet pine and warm soil in the air. She looked doll-like in her cape and dark leather shoes against the bright sunlight. After a long winter, her skin was not gently porcelain, but instead a waxen and tallowed complexion coloured only by the vigour of the honest walk and the spirit of the good earth around her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, she passed the same gnarled pines, and the same buried fallout shelter by Silverwater Creek, and the same abandoned machine shed that slumped closer to the fenceline with each passing season. It collapsed one day in March, baring its rusted mechanical organs briefly before it was buried in winter snow. She would look at the old tractor and wonder what part it had played in the lives of the stewards of these old fields. She thought about the factory where it might have been made and was struck with sadness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After five years of walking in this timeless landscape, she no longer resented its obtrusion on her journey to school. She had memorised everything there was to memorise along her path. She recognised lichen on the old stair rail like moles on the face of a friend, and could recite the make and count of the wine bottles in the bed of the creek. It occurred to her, in some small way, that it was only after the beauty of the path had evaporated that she was able to truly visit it. It was the eternal conflict of landscape, she supposed; it was only now, in her utter boredom and total blindness to landscape, that she had finally removed herself from the vista and allowed herself to see place as it was for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had intuitively discovered for herself a central tenant of Upen, where the sublime had been usurped by the much quieter, and much richer, mundane. The sublime screams like colour through pine leaves; the mundane is the dew that gathers silently on the spokes of the tractor ruin. The sublime is in the perfume of country air; the mundane is in the carcass of a beetle nestled in the moss; the sublime is the self-conscious rouge on her lips; the mundane a dirty scuff on her sock ankle; the sublime the whisper of the wind, betrayed by a new bud beneath a branch; the prism of her light blue eyes by the moistness around her nostrils in the cool weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it was never a matter of birth and decay, or light and dark; it was never about a schism to begin with. It was a fundamental kinship with a transcendental memory of place, and the hidden spirituality of the unimportant, and the sweetness of the unbeautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unconscious recognition became conscious knowledge, and it obliterated her world. The entire axis of cosmology tripped. The world pivoted. Beauty and pleasure were rediscovered in an instant. She looked around her, and she had discovered the mundane. She was no longer standing amidst landscape, but mere place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her heart swelled with pleasure. Her blood sounded in her ears. Through five years of emotional labour and millions of footfalls, she had discovered the mundane in the sublime, if only here. Her eyes and heart had a sudden clarity; she was filled with love not just for the smallest of things, but in fact the smallest things exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the feeling she had in that moment was by its nature irreproducible, she would do her best to recognise the mundane everywhere. She sincerely fell in love with &lt;em&gt;Newda&lt;/em&gt; shortly after. The small and honest voice of the simple and inconsequential and imperfect called to her wherever she went, and from then on she was always at peace in place; for she was always surrounded by patina, and change, and the most delicate hinge of life that animated the inanimate in her renewed understanding of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Traditional Dress in Vekllei</title>
      <link>https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-01-11-dress/</link>

&lt;a  href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/en6pig/a_foreigners_guide_to_female_traditional_dress_in/&#34;   target=&#34;_blank&#34;  class=&#34;book-btn&#34;&gt;
  Archived from the original article here
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tzipora, illustrated here, is happy because her traditional dress makes her feel stylish and her cape is soft and warm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei is an ancient culture with many inherited and vestigial artefacts. Nowhere is this more apparent than in her national dress, particularly that for women, where old and new collide as they do all across Vekllei. Pre-war, post-war and future are present here. Let’s run through some of the elements, which can be found throughout her society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fountain hairpieces.&lt;/strong&gt; These are the centrepieces of Vekllei ceremonial hairstyles, and are aided by sticks traditionally or more commonly gels today. These are only for women, and are arranged at the top of the head. Hats are not worn with traditional dress, and the Fountain hairpieces date back to the 12th century, in initial Danish settlement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temple hairpieces.&lt;/strong&gt; These hairpieces are fastened symmetrically at the side of the head, and accompany the fountain. Traditionally an exclusively male style, it was incorporated into women’s culture in postwar liberalisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uroastopet (birth flower) hairpieces.&lt;/strong&gt; Flowers are central component of Vekllei animistic iconography, and their employ with people is analogous to Zodiac or astrological traditions. A birth flower is usually attached as a hairpiece in ceremony to distinguish the girl against the stars, acknowledging the chance in her birth not dependent on blood or heritage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Floral collar pins.&lt;/strong&gt; These are recent items that first appeared in the last half-century, in response to the urbanisation of Vekllei life. Where traditionally flowers would be attached to the collar, here they are replaced by enamel and metal pins that are also worn with business and school shirts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regional Flower Plate.&lt;/strong&gt; This unusual item displays a special floral arrangement, called a &lt;em&gt;ro poisnesn&lt;/em&gt; (flower-tundra blood arrangement) which can be genuine or artificial. It displays a curated collection of flowers from the girl’s village or region, usually selected from a local flower-tundra.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Camisole Pinafore.&lt;/strong&gt; These pinafores first appeared as detachable suspenders in the 19th century and have become an indispensable component of styles and uniforms since. Like most elements of Vekllei ceremonial dress, its origins are in agriculture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refined Women’s Tie.&lt;/strong&gt; A woman’s tie is carefully folded to respect the integrity of its sacred source; the shape and cascading petals of the &lt;em&gt;Oa&lt;/em&gt; flower, which is the national Vekllei symbol. Men have a similar item that fastens to the neck of a tie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;School/workplace armband.&lt;/strong&gt; Armbands are universal in Vekllei. Instead of a symptom of authoritarian workplace culture, they are instead seen as markers in the country of public face. They are found in most professions and schools and have even seen ironic popularity in progressive fashion scenes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dien agricultural shirt.&lt;/strong&gt; These loose, baggy cotton shirts rolled at the elbow are a uniquely Vekllei style of dress, and appeared just prior to the time of the Camisole pinafore. Originally a male item, it is mostly worn by women today in professional and casual settings alike.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uroaten floral belt.&lt;/strong&gt; These belts are mural testaments to the lineage of a girl, usually displaying the birth flowers of her female relatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bell Sash.&lt;/strong&gt; The bell sash jingles as she moves and it sounds nice. The girls pick the bells themselves, and different sounds have different meanings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oanan lace apron.&lt;/strong&gt; These aprons are rarely worn, because they are extremely delicate, but they are precious cultural items often handed down through generations. Girls are often married in them. In postwar life, they are iconic for how the woman has been liberated from work — where even her aprons are stripped of utility and transformed into beautiful decorations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honey half-cape.&lt;/strong&gt; Vekllei is very cold, and half-capes or full-capes are often worn. You’ll find them in school uniforms and throughout professional workplaces in the country. They are interchangeable with other long coats, but are beloved for their versatility, warmth and softness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gi quarter-pleat.&lt;/strong&gt; These are very sacred items, and are designed specifically for the girl at her menarche. They usually incorporate their birth flower, birth festival and other iconography into their patterns. Girls wear them to school. Boys also have &lt;em&gt;gi&lt;/em&gt;, but they are much smaller and not nearly as intricate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory Sash.&lt;/strong&gt; A glory sash is affixed to the &lt;em&gt;uroaten&lt;/em&gt; and proclaims the beauty of the girl’s family through religious iconography and runes, called &lt;em&gt;upotenne&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thousand-pleat skirt.&lt;/strong&gt; Traditionally skirts without pleats are worn, but postwar manufacturing has gifted young women with many types of skirt and pleat less varieties have been largely substituted for decorated or “thousand-pleat” versions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sun petticoat.&lt;/strong&gt; These are petticoats that hang below the hem, and often accompany the &lt;em&gt;oanan&lt;/em&gt; lace apron as a set. Like the &lt;em&gt;oanan&lt;/em&gt;, these are very delicate and are usually only worn on special occasions. Pure white, they dirty easily below the hem and are mostly decorative, although they do have utility in supporting the weight of the girl’s skirt with pleat and sash attached.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mido socks.&lt;/strong&gt; A longer cotton sock is folded three times to make a cuff, which offers versatility in a climate that changes without warning. At the hem’s current fashion, a &lt;em&gt;mido&lt;/em&gt; sock can instantly become a stocking of sorts, depending on the make and taste of the girl. They are worn throughout the country, including in business environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Misc. felt/leather shoes.&lt;/strong&gt; There are several types of traditional Vekllei shoe, from old boots and sandals to modern makes of foreign design, like penny loafers. The choice is the girl’s, for it is by far the most impermanent style of the outfit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional dress is worn on holidays, to church, in festivals and in ceremony at school and work. To many Vekllei people, it epitomises womanhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summer had rolled into the valley, and so the air smelled of hot grass from the fields. It was quiet at the station, where a single train clacked each way in the afternoon. The only sound was the wind, which caught the heads of dry grass and roared up the slopes of the mountain ranges around her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed an exaggeration to even call it a station, since the bare concrete slab had been laid fifty years ago and left to crumble. The installation of a station sign had been the first work on it in decades. The whole world seemed to have forgotten this place. Every day she would catch the train both ways to university, and watch Vekllei’s ancient slopes groan by as the train cars rounded the waists of the valleys. There was no hurry out here. There were no thoughts of the future. In Vekllei’s warm agrestic towns, pastoral spiritualism took many forms; and for her, no site would stir the heart like the old concrete station outside of Montre-Lola.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Kodak Moment by a Vekllei Geyser</title>

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her journal for practicing writing the Vekllei language (appropriately called Vekllei), Tzipora wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heavy clouds above were children of early spring, but among the steam vents it seemed like the whole sky was polluted by geysers. Large pools, opalescent with healthy minerals, were heated by the core of the Earth. In a volcanic desert of black sand, the geysers were an oasis, rising from the sulphuric fog like a little eden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her study was well beyond mere communication by now, venturing further into the pleasures of language and poetry. It made her smile to think back at where she’d been just five years before. She recalled images of a nervous immigrant thumbing through her dictionary at a tram stop, terrified of the nonsense characters around her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geysers are the heart of Vekllei spiritualism. The town of Geyser in Vekllei is in fact the origin of the word. They are symptomatic of Vekllei’s naturalistic statehood — a testament to the impermanence of landscape and the symbiosis of people and soil. The geysers, once barren jewels of harsh volcanic landscapes, were now ringed by foliage at their edges as the seeds unwittingly carried by travellers blossomed in rich volcanic earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei people will visit from a young age. Nothing is signposted — there is no natural infrastructure. Several deaths a year are reported. As a Vekllei child you develop a relationship with your spring, and learn its unique qualities. Where it is safe to draw water, for example, and where it will boil your skin in a flash. You learn its colour and smell. In rural communities, they are an essential organ, where birth and marriage and death coalesce. Vekllei heritage is not dominated by blood, but by earth, and no clearer are the sites of life than amidst her ancient volcanoes, where the wind carries steam across dark igneous slopes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Life and Death in Vekllei Apartment Ideology</title>

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To substitute for my shocking (and deeply shameful) absence over the last two weeks, please accept a longer-form post concerning domestic Apartment Ideology in Vekllei, which they call&lt;/em&gt; Newda &lt;em&gt;and is known internationally as The Vekllei Newda School. Pictured is the apartment of our very own Zelda. While the building itself deserves a feature, for now we’ll discuss Newda as a theory and her life in this building. If you get bogged down and pissed off at the jargon, skip to the “practice” section. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how I feel about this post, I might have indulged too much, but either way, I&amp;rsquo;m BACK&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;ndash;  Hobart&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;argument&#34;&gt;Argument&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A man of the eighteenth century, plunged suddenly into our civilisation, might well have the impression of something akin to a nightmare.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Frederick Etchells, &lt;em&gt;Towards a New Architecture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some critics of architecture (and adjacent slugs) deride &lt;em&gt;Newda&lt;/em&gt; as decadent. It is as incestuous and plastic as most other modernist constructions, they say. It mistakes austerity for utility, and &lt;em&gt;le blanc&lt;/em&gt; for cleanliness. This is not an unreasonable criticism, especially since foundational Vekllei cultural principles of natural immersion and human decay seem irreconcilable with the white, shining concrete of her modern cityscape. How does a style like &lt;em&gt;Newda&lt;/em&gt; claim to be anything other than a reckless adoption of continental urbanism for its own sake; a symptom of the social decay we call postwar austerity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these people, &lt;em&gt;Newda&lt;/em&gt; represents a grotesque squandering of a rare, virgin landscape which had been wiped clean in the atomic war. It is impossible to imagine any other means by which the opportunity to rebuild today’s modern cities might arise. She could have been Paris, critics say — entirely unaware that they are discussing a city more beautiful than Paris. “Oh, to see Rome reduced to urbanist tower-blocks”; “a garden city of concrete and asbestos”; “a cauldron of plastic and rebar”; and so on go the tears. “Never had tacky decadence looked so plain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There exists a new spirit,” Le Corbusier wrote in &lt;em&gt;Towards a New Architecture&lt;/em&gt;. “Our own epoch is determining, day by day, its own style. Our eyes, unhappily, are unable yet to discern it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a tantalising phrase that was, when it finally reached Vekllei’s shores from his native France. Not just for its celebration of a young era, which appeals to Vekllei’s fluid and agnostic antihistoricism, but for its appeal to “spirit”, which gestures towards the intimate and gentle Vekllei nature. Hence the critics’ fundamental mischaracterisation of Vekllei’s great modernist project — namely that the country understands nature as an organ alienated from their “civilisation,” or that they recognise their æsthetics as a progression of history. Neither is true, as is plain to anyone who has been to any part of Vekllei. Landscape is suppressed in Vekllei, even in an industrial age, and so there is no schism between the human and the natural worlds despite the fact that they live in tower-blocks and wear clothes of rayon and gingham. And “History” in Vekllei is gutted as easily as they might a tuna for which their cuisine is known; their collective story as a state is one of movements and gestures, laterally and lineally at times, and “backwards” at others (although to apply such a word to Vekllei is to criminally misunderstand her project).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the application of sickly sentimentalist instincts to Vekllei that betray the reactionary criticism of Newda as a “superficial, austere school of architecture” for what it is; a deeply historicist suspicion ingrained in the same modernist instincts it claims to critique; at once fucking and wagging a finger at the pig. It is also a brash rejection of Vekllei sociology as a foundation of petticoat ideology, and mistakes Vekllei’s “material culture” (her buildings, her clothes, her toys) as something somehow disconnected from so-called &amp;ldquo;petticoat intuition&amp;rdquo;, which is just a phrase for the social unconscious that forms consensus in the country on everything from television soaps to her beloved tower-blocks. This is aesthetics in action, what Hegel praised in &lt;em&gt;The Philosophy of Right&lt;/em&gt; as “philosophising, which could well have continued to spin itself into its own web of scholastic wisdom, [coming] into closer contact with actuality.” &lt;em&gt;Newda&lt;/em&gt; is real, and it is alive in the instincts of the ordinary Vekllei person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paris can burn. &lt;em&gt;Newda&lt;/em&gt; will survive a thousand atomic strikes, through that cockroach known as ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not let Vekllei architecture, which might be assaulted by promiscuous subjectivity or the bores of American objectivity, be discussed in anything but a sociological arena. When talking about Vekllei things, it is a mistake to rely on uniquely Western (or otherwise) constructs. As Adorno noted in &lt;em&gt;Aesthetics&lt;/em&gt;, taste is preprogrammed — the “sublime,” so it is invoked, is spiritual phenomenology, dependent on so-called objectivity only insofar as objectivity relates to your postcode and personal wealth. &lt;strong&gt;Tell a man he is listening to a Stradivarius and replace it with any other violin, and watch the sublime grow mold.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;theory&#34;&gt;Theory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decoration has nothing to do with sophistication, nor spirituality. Vekllei is characterised by honesty as a premise in itself — not in how they talk or how they do business, but in the frankness and clarity of Vekllei culture in ideology and its cities. “Honesty” is to make plain the exact functioning and beneficiaries of the economy; the production and movement of commercial goods; the labour and value of “commodities”; and the material and operation of machines and structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So too should it inform the foundations of life. Housing is one of the greatest urgencies in the mind — and so architecture should respond to urgency with the solidity and reliability required of it. That essence, or “form,” is the premise of a structure, and it requires the reestablishment of architecture not as “style” but as an ideology built upon a place of living defined by form, purpose, and purity. Newda is characterised by large light wells, common areas, the integration of civic essentials (like food-production, hydroponics, gardens, shallow pools for washing and bathing), and expression through shape. In form, Newda is defined by strong vertical geometry, the baring of utility including pipes and water tanks, and strong colour. Newda structures are constructed in béton brut, even in smaller villages, abiding by the principles of &lt;em&gt;dumousiantopet&lt;/em&gt;, or ‘beautiful and seperate’. A Newda structure is large enough to house a community but appears gentle and lightweight, since it perches majestically on large columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many types of Newda buildings designed in many different languages and principles of architecture, but I’m approaching the character limit here so we’ll pursue them another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;practice&#34;&gt;Practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a tour with Zelda on her journey inside her building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facing the street is a conservatory atrium of ten stories, which is filled with trees. It opens out into the air at its base, since the entire structure is raised on elegant columns that encourage the ground floor as a place of public living. The path to the central elevator towers are lined on each side by a wading pool with a depth of one meter — the pool tiles are bright-coloured and contrast each other. They make a good place to cool your feet in summer. Since the load of the structure is vested in columns in the interior, glass encircles the atrium façade like a ribbon, serving as a natural lightwell and growing space for produce-bearing plants which supplement the Vekllei diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zelda calls an elevator at the free-standing tower, since she lives on the eighth floor. The elevator is glass-lined and she soars up through the canopy of the indoor forest as it moves. The apartments of the eighth floor open into lome a’ pasænet or an ‘internal street’. These are found in most Vekllei apartment buildings. The street is a long balcony, decadently wide, that runs the length of the interior and connects the five apartments of that floor. Large glass windows in the apartments look out into the internal street, or are hidden with curtains in times of privacy. The street is a popular place to read or meet friends and neighbours, since the yawning interior multiplies the sense of space tenfold, and it received direct sunlight throughout most of the day. At sunset, the glass façade of the public interior casts a warm, fantastical light on the ten streets of the ten-story building, transforming the space into a prismatic cathedral of light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping in to the footwell of the apartment, Zelda removes her shoes. There’s some rumour about the custom dating back to the Viking days as a sign of peaceful intention, but today it’s for cleanliness. The living room is sunken, and is lighted by the windows looking out into the interior street, which receive sun about the time she comes home. The kitchen overlooks the living space and indoor fig, and includes a large partition/cupboard that can roll on rails across the width of the apartment. There are many small examples of similar modularity throughout the apartment, balanced carefully with Newda’s affection for permanence. Pipes run beneath the concrete for underfloor heating, providing toasty floors in Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s dark, brutal winters.
The apartment is divided between a semi-public half, which includes the living, dining and cooking areas, and a ‘private half’ which contains the two bedrooms, bathroom and laundry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zelda took the larger bedroom despite her initial protestations — Baron insisted, and so that’s where she spends all her time when he’s not home. It’s by far the biggest space she’s ever had to herself. In fact, thinking back, this is the first room she hasn’t had to share since she was ten. In other buildings it would be large enough to house a cramped studio apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next door is the bathroom. There, you&amp;rsquo;ll find a French bidet, which is separated by a wall from what looks like, at first glance, a modest oriental wet room and bath. The precise opposite is true. It is a Vekllei (that is to say, Scandinavian) wet room. Instead of cleaning your body with a shower and bucket and then soaking in a hot bath, a Vekllei person scalds their skin until it glows and then plunges into a tub of cold water. The contrast of temperature encourages vasodilation and then constriction of the circulatory system, which, in addition to the hydrostatic pressure supplied by the bath, invigorates the skin and can help with muscle fatigue. Some experts believe it may aid the immune system. Vekllei bathers generally do not spend luxurious amounts of time in the bath or shower — cleaning is a utilitarian process, which, while shocking and stressful in its temperature contrast, leaves the bather refreshed and with sensitive skin that lends to a feeling of sterility. Public baths work much the same way, through the scalding and cooling principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An empty storage room, indicative of Baron and Tzipora&amp;rsquo;s spartan minimalism, conceals a small personal laundry. A private laundry is considered luxurious in Vekllei, especially in urban areas where such things are easily communalised, but these apartment towers are new and these are among its benefits.
Finally, there is Baron&amp;rsquo;s bedroom and study. Like his daughter, he is a creature of routine, perfectly acclimatised to a home of any size. There is enough space here for a full-size electrotype and the books he needs to work from home on the occasions that permit it. Just beyond his door, in the living area, is a prayer table for their respective friends and family who have passed on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A “Horizon Wing” Atomic Passenger Jet</title>

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-12-09-wing/&#34;&gt;Click here for a view inside the wing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although  the CN-1 Horizon Wing passenger jet was not a “flying wing,” that  didn’t stop Comen Aeroyards, the manufacturer, from celebrating it as  such. Much like similar large-wing aircraft from McDonnell and de  Havilland, the CN-1’s large vertical stabilisers and obvious centre  fuselage precluded it from qualifying as an authentic “flying wing,”  which were already common in many air forces at this time. To argue the  etymology, however, is to miss the point entirely — the “flying wing” is  a style of flying, not a technical appraisement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei Overseas Airways (VOA), a subsidiary of the Vekllei Air Service, operates many types of aircraft for different markets. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/dyjdsn/air_stewards_in_vekllei/&#34;&gt;You can see their uniforms here&lt;/a&gt;.  Some of these are small and propeller-driven. Others are particularly  expensive and unusual — the astroplanes used to reach cities on the moon  are among the more fantastical. The CN-1 occupies a space between the  needle-like supersonic jet for business and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/e0xl3w/oceanliners_of_the_sky_vacuum_dirigibles_in/&#34;&gt;the large airship for leisure travel&lt;/a&gt;.  It allows the wandering family (or the comfort-conscious individual) to  make good time while retaining the liberty to eat, smoke, read and  wander comfortably about the aircraft. In the wings you’ll find a  canteen, a bar, a reading room, and sleeping cabins that can be booked  in advance. Because of these amenities, the CN-1 serves only  long-distance international routes originating from the Vekllei Global  Jetport, including to Los Angeles, Rio de Janeiro, Cairo, Moscow, Tokyo,  Shanghai, and Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power  plant aboard is a 6MW air-cooled molten salt reactor using an indirect  air-cycle system. The CN-1 is nicknamed “the hunchback” by mechanics for  its large air intake atop the main fuselage. The air-cycle system,  aided by sunburst-style radiators courtesy of General Reactor, limits  radioactive pollution in operation and does away with most of the heavy  shielding required by early nuclear passenger jets at the turn of the  21st century. Her large wing gives her tremendous lift and a smooth  glide, allowing low-power flight at cruising altitude for a quiet trip.  Although she is the first in a series of aircraft for the New Salmon  Design Bureau and Comen Aeroyards, she is largely adapted from the  XCn-series of military prototypes that have been languishing in  development for nearly a half-century. Though the design is sound, her  military applications are less certain, and so now the CN-1 flies folk  around the world peacefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  front-facing glass in the common areas lend to vistas never seen before  by the ordinary person. For a citizen of Vekllei, flying with VOA is as  simple as phoning ahead to reserve a seat. For those around the world,  your options for getting on the CN-1 are grim — Vekllei is a closed,  protectionist country and, save for a handful of CN-1s operating with  CAAC Airlines in China, your only option is to purchase a ticket to  Vekllei for an exorbitant price, which can run as high as US$10,000  today’s money for a one-way ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m working on a few more aircraft for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/&#34;&gt;r/vekllei&lt;/a&gt;’s SkyMonth. Let me know if you have any questions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inside VOA’s “Flying Wing” Atomic Passenger Jet</title>

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this limited cross-section of a CN-1 “Horizon” Wing&lt;/strong&gt;, the scale of the aircraft is immediately impressed upon the reader. It is nearly four times as wide as the older wide-body passenger jets of yesteryear, and twice as wide as most American and European supersonic jets. It is no coincidence that the “flying wing” concept was only made possible by the development of supersonic jetport infrastructure, with their wide and long runways, at the turn of the century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since their introduction, the flying wings have been exclusively a vehicle for leisure and tourism worldwide. The man of business takes a supersonic jet, which permits attendance of company business on two or even three continents in a single day. The wealthy family prefers the comfort and quiet of a large subsonic aircraft like the CN-1, which ensures a timely arrival without the cramped cabins of a fast aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And transport of the wealthy they are, for only rich cities can afford the land area and facilities of a jetport capable of hosting a flying wing. Jetports are a limited network linking the global elite: Los Angeles, New York, Vekllei, London, Paris, Moscow, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Sydney and Johannesburg, along with some others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei International Airways (later renamed Vekllei Overseas Airways, or VOA) flies 22 CN-1s, the first generation of the Vekllei flying wing. We’ll look at more technical details in the next post. 200 passengers can be aboard during flight, and it offers both sleeping cabins and row seating. In the cloudlounges abreast of the main fuselage are a bar and upscale canteen respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even minor adjustments to the aircraft’s bank are felt violently in the wingtips, and so passenger areas are concentrated near the aircraft’s centre fuselage. Nonetheless, the common areas are closed and passengers are returned to belted seats in the centre fuselage for landing, since adjustments made in flight can easily send passengers (and anything not tied down) into the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panoramic windows of the CN-1 lounges lend to dizzying views unlike any other on this Earth. It is comparable to visiting Moidonnest (Vekllei’s Moon City) and looking back at the Earth for the first time. It recalls the ocean liners of the late 19th century, but her boilers are atomic and her cabins are pressurised. Flying VOA is to enjoy flying as an act in itself; a further proclamation of Vekllei’s longstanding commitment to pleasure in infrastructure and common luxury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice coloured illustration of a person takes me an hour, tops. Let&amp;rsquo;s just say I vastly underestimated how long it takes to illustrate machines. After an Author update tomorrow, we&amp;rsquo;re going to look at the exterior of the CN-1 and then airline food! Then we&amp;rsquo;ll have a few more different aircraft, including supersonic, helijets, and military aircraft to wrap up SkyMonth. Let me know as always have you have any questions. It’s 4am here and I’ll get to them in the morning&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wallabies of the Arctic</title>

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 days without posts feels like a century. Tomorrow, SkyMonth returns, and we’ll see what it’s like flying VAS. The day after tomorrow we’ll see an update for a few things — particularly a massive (and awesome) overhaul of the Vekllei site + wiki. Yeah, if you’re wondering where I’ve been, I’ve ditched Wordpress and have been learning HTML, which is like scraping the exposed brain against unpolished concrete. And after that there will be a lot more posts to follow to make up for the silence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Hobart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The rufous-bellied wallaby or &amp;ldquo;pademelon&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; is often mistaken for a kangaroo or even a rodent, but it is neither. These furry little lumps, known both for their rotundity and fecundity, do not share the dry and tropical temperament of their marsupial cousins throughout Australia and Indonesia, and are most at home in the wet, cold temperate rainforests of the quasiantarctic island of Tasmania. They also have a significant population in the least likely of places; a similarly cool, rainy, forested rock known as Vekllei (or Iceland, historically).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They grow like a radish and their ears rotate independently on the top of their heads, searching for noises that could eat them. They are an excellent meal for any predator, and are ill-equipped for the larger, invaded ecosystems to which they are extinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei, however, in its geographic and environmental isolation, has only a population of arctic foxes and some wolves to threaten them. The island&amp;rsquo;s biosecurity laws are among the strictist in the world, mostly to protect vulnerable birds (like puffins) and the biodiversity of their unique cattle, sheep, dogs and horses. There are entire brigades of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s armed forces dedicated to the culling of feral dogs and cats, and many species common to the rest of the world — rabbits and red foxes come to mind — are not found in Vekllei, which employs ruthless culling methods to contain them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were introduced intentionally to the Les Noisnosn agricultural belt (just north of Ro) in the early 2010s. Their import was a diplomatic effort between Australia and Vekllei as part of a wider series of gestures designed to reconcile tensions between the country and the British Commonwealth just prior to the First Atomic War. The introduced pademelons were very good at eating non-native grasses which had ravaged the temperate rainforests of the region, and were able to survive on the native mosses and plants once the infestation was dealt with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty years and an atomic war later, they have spread like wildfire. A healthy population exists across the entire island, and can occasionally even be seen in city parks. Their presence in the arctic, as an Australasian marsupial, is utterly unique. They are so common (and tasty) that there are no restrictions on their hunting, and are a staple of diets in and outside of the country’s urban areas. In smaller agricultural villages, like Tzipora’s Montre-Lola, they are hunted locally and prepared for eating in the traditional principles of Upen landcare. The meat is low in fat, mild, and sweet, and is often substituted for beef in Vekllei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are timid, docile creatures that sleep in the day and come out at dusk. Outside of cities, they are often kept as pets. Although Tzipora would never keep a pademelon, she would feed a dozen of her favourite regulars each night when they came out to chew on the mosses of her property. She also took part in fostering a joey which went on to live at the village post office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you have any questions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ocean-liners of the Sky — Vacuum Dirigibles in Vekllei</title>
      <link>https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-11-24-dirigible/</link>

  Archived from the original article here
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry it took so long, mateys. I&amp;rsquo;ve been laying the first pages of the comic down and it&amp;rsquo;s like crack for me. Not much sleep and totally fell behind on SkyMonth. But, as any longtime members know, our Months are r/vekllei usually last a little longer than they should past their expiry date. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Angel and Memory of the People of Vekllei&lt;/em&gt; is the largest and most recent of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s airships. It’s usually just referred to as the &lt;em&gt;Angel of Vekllei&lt;/em&gt;, since transliteration of Vekllei hieroglyphs carry with them a lot of wordy semantic baggage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vekllei Air Service (Skyburo), the public bureau that operates the country’s commercial air fleet, also operates a dozen commercial airships of various size and capacity, colloquially referred to as ‘skyliners’. Where American skyliners are built as a luxurious alternative to the supersonic jet (although moving many thousands of times slower than one), Vekllei skyliners are similar to cruise ships, drifting lazily over continents and taking pleasure in the journey. Hilariously, the simple livery of the VAS aircraft is scaled up to absurd proportions on its airships, including the crowned circle on its keel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Angel&lt;/em&gt; exemplifies the spirit of the so-called Skyliner-mindset, since it serves a dual purpose; to carry five hundred Vekllei people across the world, and as a diplomatic vessel emphasising both the scientific achievement and peaceful intentions of the island country. For this reason, and unlike the rest of the Skyliner fleet, the dirigible only offers passage to Vekllei citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this end, it offers hundreds of passenger cabins across the middle of the ship, each with spectacular views. A grand ballroom sits beneath the fore, and the glittering crystal nosecap contains one of sixteen viewing galleries scattered about the ship. The indoor arcade and Vekllei stone-water gardens sits above the vacuum tanks, and spans nearly 250 metres in length. In the centre is a small heliport that can accommodate six helijets of a standard size. In the various glass constructions beneath the vessel you&amp;rsquo;ll find the Hall of Atomics, a library, smoking and reading rooms, and a cinema, among various other amenities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large geodesic vacuum tanks constructed of boron nitride ceramics support near-vacuums throughout the interior of the vessel. These tanks provide a maximum lift of nearly 6,000 tonnes, shedding the restrictive weight limits of yesteryear’s zeppelins for all the comforts of the modern age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei airships have extremely rigid tanks to support the creation of vacuums, which are controlled mechanically through valves. The infrastructure required to support the systems aboard is entirely electric, and powered primarily by a water-shielded atomic steam plant that powers two turbines. The primary reactor has a viewing gallery above it, where passengers can admire General Reactor’s triumph (A 16-megawatt HA5400 Series) without danger to themselves. An auxiliary reactor is positioned in the aft of the vessel in the machine room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After popular novelist Jacob Herdesnoisn&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Memories of the Sky&lt;/em&gt; recalled a summer aboard the &lt;em&gt;Angel&lt;/em&gt;, it is very popular for aspiring writers to apply for a job aboard, and use their generous days off to watch the entire world pass by from the window of their cabin, typing on an electric writer. Up to 15 per cent of its staff may be writers in the summer tour. The &lt;em&gt;Angel of Vekllei&lt;/em&gt; will usually pick up passengers at major airship terminals by lowering its inbuilt terminal to the ground, and return a few days later after touring the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very important to the Angel&amp;rsquo;s mission that it be seen by as many foreigners as possible. It might spend two or three days soaring above small towns and villages to impress upon the people there the quiet benevolence and love of science of the Vekllei people. A dirigible is quite unlike any other vessel to tour the skies today. It is luxurious and slow-moving; at once outmoded and unsurpassed. In an age of resource depletion and the race for efficiency, the vacuum dirigible is an incredible sight; a peaceful giant watching over the darkened cities of all the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Air Stewards in Vekllei</title>

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Vekllei’s flag-carrying airline might appear just one of many in the small island country, don’t be fooled — all civilian aviation operates under a &lt;em&gt;venrouive&lt;/em&gt; bureau excitingly titled the Vekllei Air Service (Skyburo), which operates several distinct ‘airlines’ but wholly controls all of them. In Vekllei economic lexicon, a bureau is the largest trade union of an industry, made up of many hundreds of others, and is partially beholden to the direction of government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes the Skyburo a ‘public airline,’ but is not government owned in the way the rest of the world might understand it. Vekllei segregates business only along personal and public lines, with the political organs of the country largely segregated from daily affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illustrated here for your viewing pleasure are the largest of Vekllei’s ‘airlines,’ represented by their stewards in uniform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vekllei-air-service&#34;&gt;Vekllei Air Service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Vekllei Air Service&lt;/strong&gt; is Vekllei’s domestic airline, and operates within the country as well as to Vekllei’s semiautonomous Atlantic possessions like Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the Azores. The fleet are mostly twin or tri-engined nuclear jets. Vekllei has a comprehensive rail network, and the domestic VAS is mostly used to ferry people between Vekllei’s various islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-domestic-office&#34;&gt;The Domestic Office&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Domestic Office&lt;/strong&gt; is an unusual organisation largely responsible for unusual or unique aircraft that require specific training to command. These include sea planes, dirigible airships, helijets and so on. Their navy and white uniforms are remarkably simple, even spartan, and are the last remaining legacy of private commercial aviation in Vekllei’s pre-war years. There was not much money for uniforms then, and they carry on in this humble tradition today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vekllei-overseas-airways&#34;&gt;Vekllei Overseas Airways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei Overseas Airways&lt;/strong&gt; is the international flag-carrier of the country, and compete with the likes of Pan-Am and BOAC. Their uniforms are the public face of Vekllei for many foreigners, and so they reflect both the dignity of the island nation and the high price required of foreigners for travel on the national carrier. It is customary to receive a bottle of Montre wine with a ticket. They also employ capes on male and female stewards, but they must be removed on the tarmac. They operate ‘flying wings’, large jets and a handful of airships called sky liners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-special-charter-service&#34;&gt;The Special Charter Service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Special Charter Service&lt;/strong&gt; is an unusual branch of the Skyburo, and is usually regarded as a government airline. Although civilian, it coordinates closely with Vekllei’s military and intelligence services to assist in moving personnel, and also would be responsible for evacuating Vekllei tourists in the event of an incident overseas or at home. Day-to-day, it operates only a few scheduled flights, with the bulk of its flight-hours spent operating charter services for bureaus and personal business alike. They wear uniforms styled after Vekllei cultural dress, which predates even the old regime and is a strong part of the national identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve just pulled a body from an air force jet here that looks like General MacMillan, and we really need to know right now if it&amp;rsquo;s him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partially buried remains of a U.S. Air Force passenger aircraft are the only blemish on the horizon of central Greenland’s frigid snowscape. It is the site of one of the greatest political scandals in American history. The ancient landscape was violently disturbed in late December of 2068, when a Grumman Atomcat slammed into the ground, killing all 10 people on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Common Interest Watchhawk programme allowed a Soviet naval patrol to report the disappearance of a low-flying aircraft without a transponder. The bodies pulled from the wreckage some hours later would set in motion a panic among Vekllei’s intelligence agencies and a bloody purge in America’s south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei military intelligence units, who arrived at the site not long after the search began, battled irradiation from the aircraft’s reactor and freezing temperatures to confirm the origins of the mystery aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s him, all right. This is bad news.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An intelligence servant of the Vekllei Intelligence Americas Bureau (AB/NI) examined the brutalised face of the general. After a moment of consideration, perhaps to reassure himself of the identity of the cadaver, he ordered a suppression order over the site, which would enforce radio silence and conceal the disaster from the political organs of the Vekllei state for up to six hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacMillan had been distinguished in the U.S.A.F., but would have been an unremarkable soldier in history if it were not for the separatist movements of the Southern states in the late 21st century. The Marshal became Commander-in-Chief overnight, and quickly positioned himself as a lynchpin of negotiation between the separatist and federal governments. As a reasonable military man, he was trusted by the Federal committee, and was at the time of his demise negotiating the lend-lease of strategic nuclear sites that had been seized under the de facto splintering of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the lease, the United States Armed Forces would retain control of sites essential for ‘American continental security,’ but would withdraw sanctions against the separatist states first imposed under the Dallas Accords. So what the fuck was MacMillan doing mangled on a Greenland ice slope?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the dead was his mistress Olivia Scott-Madison and his two children, Daniel and Sofia MacMillan. His children were in nightclothes. Fighter jets were buzzing the Atlantic. It was clear something had gone terribly wrong in the hours prior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outside world would never learn the details of the MacMillan Incident, or its causes. What would follow, however, was the purge of many longtime associates of MacMillan from the military hierarchy of the Dallas Coalition states, and the immediate denunciation of the General and his political associates. AB/NI had long chased whispers of a coup against Dallas leadership in the months prior, and it appeared the perpetrator had arrived spectacularly closer to Vekllei’s gaze than anticipated. The bodies of the General, his family and his aides were flown to Vekllei, where they were identified and placed into archives. Both prime ministers of the country were informed, but were told that Vekllei would not need to worry about attempted American reclamation of the crash site or its occupants. Sure enough, neither the aircraft nor the bodies of its passengers were formally requested by the U.S. or the Dallas states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings of an investigation into the crash were inconclusive and quickly shelved. The aircraft was flying low, perhaps to avoid radar detection, so it was possible the pilots misjudged their altitude in the poor weather. Perhaps there had been an incident on board. There were no technical faults determined in the remains of the aircraft, which remains on that slope to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was known to the wider world was that the proceeding months would spark the bloodiest period of the ongoing American crisis, and the collapse of diplomatic relations between the separatist and federal governments. MacMillan and his family were the first of the vanguard separatists to die, but they were far from the last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very difficult to obtain papers for tourism in Vekllei as an American, despite the fact that the Arctic island nation is positioned obstinately between the Americas and Europe. It’s not made difficult for any discernible political reason, either — relations with the U.S. are as good as they could be for a country like Vekllei. Nonetheless, tourism is regarded as a risk rather than an opportunity, and most Americans who visit for pleasure are wealthy enough to put up the sums of cash required to enter on the national carriers that exclusively operate in Vekllei’s airspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping out into the country for the first time is a hell of an experience. As an American you don’t really have a framework for understanding these people. They’re not European, or really Scandinavian. They don’t share many cultural or political bonds with the continental powers. And they’re not as easy to politicise or orientalise in the same way the folk of the USSR or Asia can be. They’re a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, work in Vekllei is social, and there are no real laws governing child labour. It is common to see children as young as twelve working as guides in the city’s largest jetport, Vekllei International, since work is basically a form of play. The dependence on Vekllei people for help (since a foreigner can only navigate society with the assistance of those that speak the language and understand the economy) essentially infantilises dignified, wealthy tourists otherwise not used to being looked down upon. This is further exaggerated by Vekllei’s complete absence of honourifics, lack of professional culture and suspicion of foreigners, meaning that even tourist infrastructure in the country regards Americans as a curiosity to be investigated and gawked at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These barriers to entry only further isolate the country from the outside world, in a position that is (in the late 2070s) totally unique. They are not quite &amp;lsquo;white&amp;rsquo;, not quite &amp;lsquo;religious&amp;rsquo;, not quite &amp;lsquo;Western&amp;rsquo; and not quite &amp;lsquo;communist&amp;rsquo;. Their iconography is nonsense; their language is spoken only by themselves, and their political motivations are as complex and built on intuition as they are incomprehensible to outsiders. Hence the scene above, where the new assistant to the ambassador and his wife are thumbed out of the terminal by a thirteen-year-old girl who speaks broken English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young worker pictured here carries only a radio for communicating with her colleagues and a pouch to fill with personal items, jelly beans or whatever takes her fancy. They work in shifts of usually a few hours each, which are coordinated with the larger nuclear monowing jets that land from the Americas around noon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Vekllei Timetable</title>

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s wind down Study Month with a look into the Vekllei curriculum. A few days ago I wrote about how Vekllei schools operate on fundamentally different assumptions about what it means to be ‘a child’. Let’s take a look at how that pans out in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most students study about 3-5 days a week, depending on the taste of the student and the work timetable of their parents. These days might occur sequentially or be scattered throughout the week, but most common is a Monday-Wednesday table table of four hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora, whose previous schooling was in a Catholic school in California, struggled to make sense of her timetable at first. The Vekllei curriculum very quickly depreciates courses outside of the interest of the student, and so staples of modern Western education — science, history, mathematics, language, were jumbled and in some cases dropped altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s break down her timetable, illustrated partially in English for your convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mathematics. Zelda struggles with even basic maths, and so she retains a course for her own wellbeing. Mandatory curriculum maths in Vekllei is mostly pragmatic and straightforward, and teaches theory as well as the basics of calculation and operations. More abstract maths like algebra and calculus are generally only taught in advanced classes designed to facilitate interest in those who show promise in it. Zelda is not one of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language. Zelda is an immigrant and at this point in her life speaks only primitive, conversational Vekllei. Because of this, she has three hours of class time a week but attends a special class for tutoring after school each day. She also makes use of her own time to study Vekllei logographs, called &lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt;. Baron is a good help because she can practice conversationally with him without the shame of mangling language in the real world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideology. Zelda for the first time in her life is beginning to engage with the world as a global network, and is quickly learning geography and flags to illustrate it in her mind. The Ideology class is concerned with worldview and how social structures influence it. It looks at traditional political ideologies as well as unconscious assumptions, and how those things affect policy and geopolitics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chemistry. Zelda likes chemistry and has good grades in it, and so she’s testing her ability in that area. Although she’s clearly developed an aptitude for the arts and language, she’s young enough to doubt her place and still enjoys experimenting with disciplines outside her expertise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sewing. Zelda likes sewing, and it helps her feel useful since she’s largely dependent on others for most other parts of her life. This class teaches young Vekllei people practical skills for maintaining clothes in the household. Next year, she plans to take on a more rigorous maintenance course to varnish wood and caulk windows, since it takes forever to get a contractor up to their apartment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Illustration. Zelda does not have enough of an ego to be intimidated by the skills of those around her, so she enjoys the class as a therapeutic outlet for her boundless creative impulses. She is trying to learn to draw portraits so she can do one of Baron for Christmas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Club time. Zelda belongs to the news club of Lola 7th School, and works on weekends as a photographer for the weekly newsletter. Her colleagues are polite and ambitious, and they appreciate her desire to learn. On school time she mostly meets with other members to help print the newsletter by hand on the old jobber press, and develop her photos in the school’s dark lab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Society. Zelda learns Vekllei history and values in this class, which helps explain everything from the intricacies of the Bureau System and Sundress Municipalism to more intimate notions of the proper way to wear a quarter-pleat and &lt;em&gt;semoisnesne&lt;/em&gt; (sun-facing attitude). It also helps contrast Vekllei’s system against the rest of the world, and more explicitly outlines Vekllei’s place in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Tzipora would have many troubles with school, none of them were ever related to her enthusiasm for her classes. Since she picked the ones that benefited her and had plenty of time off to explore the skills learned in them, she developed a healthy curiosity for her talents and it was reflected well in her grades. But, as most Vekllei students will tell you, they learn just as much growing up outside of school as they do inside the classroom. She would not have it any other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each year, a race is held amongst the most remarkable geological monuments of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s interior. Steep mountains forged in the restlessness of the European and American tectonic plates become deadly checkpoints in the world&amp;rsquo;s most high-stakes aeroplane race in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-speed, high-maneuverability jets (manufactured by the likes of General Reactor, V.K. Heavy Industries, and Kaleidoscope Aerospace) roar through narrow valleys in time trials that last only a few minutes. These jets are built differently from your standard light aerocraft, and feature heavily shielded reactors and cockpits (or, unusually, combustion engines), automatic ejection mechanisms, and a fuselage and wings designed to crumple upon impact. They are constructed first and foremost around high-velocity crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although a high-risk sport where fatalities are common, it remains popular in Europe and Vekllei. In the latter, the races are organised and subsidised by air racing orgs, usually clubs or pilot associations, and enthusiasts hike the otherworldly slopes of the valleys to watch racing jets compete for glory. In a world where seconds make the difference between failure and a world record, aerocrafts and pilots are pushed to their limits.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Schools in a Society Without Children</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about childhood and utopia. This post comes as we wind down Study Month in r/vekllei. Strap in kids, because this one gets kind of heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you get into the idea of it, “The Child” is a particularly unfortunate projection&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s not something most would agree with, but that’s how it’s worked out in the late 2070s. In fact, critical foundations of how foreigners view the world are not culturally neutral subjects as they might assume, timeless and naturally occurring, but are in fact symptoms of ideology. And despite the fact that there are children everywhere, The Child as an independent category of human being is a recent invention, informed by modernism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you visit Vekllei, and pay enough attention to the ordinary routines of the common Vekllei person, you too might be struck by the absence of The Child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the Montre-Lola-Yuman School, but is usually recalled as its district number: Montre 6th. Although modestly pretty, situated in a misty valley and constructed in the postwar demonewda style (a literal portmanteau of education, or &lt;em&gt;demolan&lt;/em&gt;, and Vekllei modernism, or &lt;em&gt;newda&lt;/em&gt;), it is the site of a remarkable clash between old and new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People live simpler lives here. Smaller lives, too, focused on pleasure and its pursuit. They have less to hide, and so less to hide from their own children. Here, a kid discovers a great deal about the basic premises of life and navigating relationships from watching their parents go about their work and conversations, and learn largely through play and interaction. Older siblings take on adult, independent roles within the family whilst the United States and Europe further complexify The Child into atomised subcategories; teen-agers, pre-teens, toddlers, and so on. In Vekllei, media and products designed for The Child are uncommon, as are clothes designed for Children, and so growth is informed through exploration and observation, rather than their age and year of schooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes are small but shift mountains culturally. It is not simply that children are “small adults,” or that they are ignored or not given affection, but that the grotesque commodification of childhood has been abolished with commodity itself. The very nature of childhood, then, is different from how foreigners understand The Child. In Vekllei, children mix freely between age groups, and do not subconsciously recognise stages of development in a matter of years. They attend the same school for the entire length of their mandatory schooling. Uniforms are universal and carry all the way through university. By their early teen-age years, the young Vekllei person is ready to carry out their place in paradise. This affords the youth of Vekllei dignity and responsibility, and forces a reconsideration of identity outside of the generic expectation of that age group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, modernism does not necessarily mean commoditisation — but they&amp;rsquo;re almost always found sleeping in the same bed. There is no scandal here. From the supermarkets of Utah to the villages of Uraguay, modern ideas of The Child and Interiority have warped the human brain unconsciously, rendering the whole world a meaningless scaffold of incestuous constructions — with a cultural history buried in copies of copies of copies. The way we understand landscape, the Self, our children, are all missing or altered in Vekllei, a modernist society without modernism. The rest of the world has been this way for centuries — and, most devastatingly, as soon as these constructions were &amp;lsquo;discovered,&amp;rsquo; their origins as constructions were suppressed. It seems to have always been this way, even though it was an invention that coincided more or less with the steam engine. The Child is no more inherent to “nature” (itself a construction) than a railway locomotive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, over the course of several centuries in the Western world, the child was discovered. Once it was found, an epistemological constellation had to be erected around it to make use of it. To write a story or paint a picture, The Child is projected. A child of America today will now wear clothes for children, play with toys for children and consume media built for that age group. You can expect a child to go through distinct phases, quantified numerically through their years of modern schooling. This carries on to poison the entire lens of childhood, and indeed, the subsumption of the outside world into this sort of culture and commodity is shocking to the Vekllei tourist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unusual fact makes Vekllei unique in the ideological landscape today, at once a pioneer of the arts and industry and a pre-industrial village, free from the ideological misery of modern life. The abolishment of industry, and the rising up of all people, has rendered the Vekllei people not classless, but a single enourmous class — an intellectual, educated class. What truly makes them unique, however, is how the “old ways” and “rural priority” are alive and well in the cities and apartments of the modern Vekllei person. That is utopia in Vekllei today, and that is what it means to grow up there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about childhood and utopia. This post comes as we wind down Study Month in r/vekllei. Strap in kids, because this one gets kind of heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora and Cobian, pictured here, have very different stories but both have felt something was not quite right about them. That difference, so it would turn out, would blossom into a preference for women as partners, in the unusual desexualised way Vekllei goes about homosexuality in the late 2070s. To Cobian, who grew up in Vekllei, the realisation was fairly straightforward, although not without moments of anxiety and doubt. To Tzipora, who grew up in the United States, she found herself in crisis. She had previously held deep reservations about so-called ‘bolshevik lesbianism,’ only to discover a contradictory, immutable fact about herself. The canyon between their understandings of how relationships work reveals just how unique Vekllei is in the world today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of many pains of Vekllei’s growing material wealth was the economic unchaining of women from their husbands, and a shift towards solitude and independence for both men and women. For many, especially in the anxiety of the First Atomic War, lust became work, and marriages and birthrates fell quickly. As the poverty of post-war life developed into fledgling community-focused industry, so too did so-called “economic feminisation” (the abolishment of the male burden through the bureau system and work as pleasure) bring about changes in how women understood themselves in a society without commodity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These economic facts coincided with serious cultural seizures of anger and confusion at the collapse of old values and the bloodline-focused family, which culminated in a period of great population stagnation and cultural unrest without anything to fill the vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a move rare for Vekllei’s growing council-style democracy called Sundress Municipalism, a cultural movement was enacted at a national level. It was called something along the lines of a ‘sun-facing’ attitude, or &lt;em&gt;semoisnesne&lt;/em&gt;, in which free love, relationship pragmatism and most of all, familial independence were encouraged to foster baby-making and marriage happiness. Realistically, this cultural ambition was reinforced with several hundred social programmes designed to mitigate domestic violence, marriage breakdown and divorce. The restructuring of the post-war legal system, in conjunction with semoisnesne, had the unintended side-effect of decriminalising homosexuality, making Vekllei one of the few countries in the world to have done so. Normalisation was not a smooth experience, and social problems linger to this day, but is nonetheless utterly unique in the cultural landscape of the modern Western world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semoisnesne, like most cultural phenomena, has seen a downturn in popularity in the most recent generation of teen-agers and young adults, as part of a wider trend of emotional and sexual reticence in part as a reaction to the ostentatious displays of sexuality of the decades prior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, semoisnesne has made Vekllei a better country. It is now much easier to announce your preference for love in your own gender than it was previously, and that brings with it a whole shift in worldview — most crucially of normalisation, where such things are tolerated and visible in everyday society. Like many ambitious progressive projects, it has become a cultural pariah in recent years (teens today sarcastically refer to their attitude as &lt;em&gt;lumoisnesne&lt;/em&gt;, which better translates to good-facing [in the sense of a moral or ethical good]), but its marked impact on emotional intelligence and feminisation of the country has undeniably set Vekllei apart in a time dominated by fear and cultural retreat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a follow-up &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/dj5di0/uniform_ideology_in_the_arctic_north/&#34;&gt;to this post&lt;/a&gt;, as part of Vekllei’s “Study Week,” where we’re touring education and youth in the utopia of Vekllei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to their girls, who are adorned with many layers of clothing and dazzling patterns, the schoolboys of Vekllei are unadorned. Lace and quarter-pleats give way to bolder forms and masculine colours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much of Vekllei’s uniform ideology straddles complex (and often precipitous) schisms of modern and traditional clothing items, boys have received considerably more progressive attention than their sisters. They sport jackets of synthetic materials where girls favour wool and cotton, but do not enjoy the same modularity or flexibility in style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visible here are the standard armbands universal to Vekllei life, a male tie (although only male in an education context, and is often appropriated by rebellious young women), and a captain’s plate to distinguish certain older students as club leaders, which are integral parts of the Vekllei schooling experience. Clubs operate independently of the school and often assist students in honing their expertise for higher education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter, shown here on the right, had a game for a while where he’d surreptitiously point at his crotch, and when you looked he’d scold you for looking at his dick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone. In celebration of the approach of exams (at least in the Southern Hemisphere), we turn our gaze north to Vekllei to celebrate Study Week. Every other day we’ll be looking at education in Vekllei, and today we’re looking at uniforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life in Vekllei is filled with uniforms for work and in study, for a various historical and cultural reasons. In the late 21st century, in a society where work is social, they help distinguish and professionalise employment, which grants important psychological and social benefits. Where a uniform might be employed for economic reasons in a country of poverty, or as a form of social control in schools, in Vekllei they are identifiers and champions of labour in a workplace or school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the students of Vekllei, a single uniform is distributed across all ages of schooling, from preschool right through university and miscellaneous higher education. For girls, it is highly modular and incorporates important cultural items of clothing, like the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; quarter-pleat, &lt;strong&gt;temple&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;fountain&lt;/strong&gt; hairpieces, and overskirt lace aprons called &lt;strong&gt;sun petticoats&lt;/strong&gt; (in ceremony). Although Vekllei was once cold year-round, today it sees warm summers and mild winters that encourage distinct summer and winter fashions. A girl’s preference in uniforms may cycle through many styles over her schooling years, from spartan minimalism in high school (of just an armband, white shirt and red skirt) to decadent ceremony in her university years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vekllei Semaphore, the language of colour and shape, red and white imply both youth and energy (as well as sweetness, determinedness and purity depending on the context), and are often recognised as the national colours. In youth, it distinguishes education from traditional labour (in the literal, physical sense), which is communicated with navy blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-quality uniforms are a marker of national pride, as indicators of national wealth after the shameful poverty of the First Atomic War’s fallout. To the people of Vekllei, an intricate and expensive uniform distributed amongst ordinary people greatly influences the national ego, and further contributes to Vekllei’s social and cultural isolation from the rest of the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, we’ll be seeing how the boys compare. Then things will get a little more exciting.  Please let me know if you have any questions!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tattoos of Violence on Quiet Men</title>

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where tattoos had once been an indication of class and work, they were now uncommon. Both class and work had been abolished. Tattoos were almost never seen in the prism of ordinary Vekllei life, but in less savoury occupations they were found where utopian concessions collide with violence and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baron rolled up his sleeves and laid them out for her. You could accuse him of many things — he was a reticent bloke — but he was never dishonest with Tzipora. She was as much a companion as a daughter, and he treated her with the respect he’d afford any close colleague or friend. His upper arm was marked with faded illustrations from a previous chapter of life. Most obvious was a dragon that looked like it had been done professionally, or at least by a comrade who’d had some experience. It was intricate and artful. The rest were simple words or illustrations, maybe done by the man himself. Holding her tongue about the dragon tattoo, which demanded attention in its colour and scale, she asked about three dots that matched the patterns of her shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Those are for Amelie. I mentioned her, didn’t I? She was my sister — she would have liked you, too. She had a strange sense of humour.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They marked the grave of his sister who passed as a teen-ager from tuburculosis. It was a common outbreak in the poverty that followed the First Atomic War. She was fifteen — the Vekllei lifespan is measured in sets of five. Beneath it was a dagger, or improvised military cross, listing the initials of two friends of his and his years of service. “All done,” he told her, “while black-out drunk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She asked about his friends, and where they were, and he told her he didn’t know. “It’s true. That’s how service overseas goes sometimes. Look how long it took for me to get back here. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recognise them.” He paused for a moment, and raised his eyebrows. “Most likely, they’re dead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the Chinese dragon, illustrated cleanly with improvised equipment, lay a history of sweltering heat and combat. This one was a soldier’s tattoo, proud and impossible to ignore. You don’t give much thought to scarring your skin if you’re about to die. She did not know how long he was there, or in what capacity, because he did not talk about his time in the army. She just knew he was young — maybe a few years older than her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She liked his tattoos. For the thirty years she would know him, he was outwardly a quiet and thoroughly unextraordinary man. He took part in no great pleasures except a glass of wine on Friday evenings and a movie with Zelda on Sunday. Not once did he ever raise his voice at her. He smoked occasionally, and a pipe on weekends. But when he rolled up his sleeves after supper to smoke his pipe, and watch the evening from their eighth-floor balcony, the snake climbing the dagger was visible on his forearm. And behind that dagger, and that snake, there was a filthy room in Ariquemes, and a baby’s cry, and blood. A sinister revelation settled on the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Zelda would once explain, you might go to a friend’s party or parent-teacher, and all the other dads would see hers and think he looked like a professor or bank teller. She liked to think they gave no regard to him at all — he looked like a quiet, pleasant, nothing-person. But if he reaches for his left sleeve and rolls it up, that all changes. He reveals himself to be a figure of death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not uncommon for gangs to form in Vekllei, especially among immigrant communities otherwise marginalised by a complex logographic language and rigid belief system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, in a country of plenty, there is not much to otherwise identify with. Class is irrelevant in utopia, and the basic ideas of manhood and womanhood are being destroyed in hand with the abolishment of industry. Racial identifiers certainly exist — the population is descended almost entirely from Scandinavian settlers (with notably fair hair) and those of mixed Inuit-Scandinavian ancestry, whom carry Caucasian features but have dark, often black, hair. There are also many Vekllei of immigrant heritage, largely from Eastern and Southern Europe after the First Atomic War. It is along these racial lines that bullying occurs in schools and atomised communities form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Montre, a university city of Northern Vekllei, it is not uncommon for these prejudices to fester. The capital may be cosmopolitan, but cities like Montre and Adouisneh are largely homogenous. Decades on from the First Atomic War, arguments between native Vekllei and children of Greek heritage continue to play out, usually in stupid and meaningless ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cast against the racialised violence of the U.S. in the 2070s, and the Apartheid regime in South Africa, Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s ethnic tensions would be incomprehensible. On the small, arctic island, however, they will slowly be buried as generations cycle on and the pleasures of common Vekllei life realise themselves. There is no room in Vekllei for anything but Vekllei ambitions, regardless of heritage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The State of the Moon in 2078</title>

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome again to MoonMonth! It started a week ago and will go until I’ve said all I can say. We’re looking at how Vekllei conquered the moon today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei unequivocally won the space race. Not because it had the first man in space — the Soviets succeeded in that. Nor were they the first to the moon — the Americans had been there for nearly a century. But Vekllei was the first to establish permanent habitation of the Moon’s southern pole, and its claims of territory were reluctantly accepted in the early 2070s after nearly a decade of heated diplomacy. Although the value of the Southern Pole had been known for some time, it was Vekllei that leapfrogged the world’s largest powers to secure the moon’s most valuable real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Vekllei’s Mt Io, which the rest of the world knows as the Malapert Massif, Vekllei’s largest city enjoys more sunlight year-round than the arctic home country, and parts of the Copette Basin (Shackleton Basin in English) have peaks of eternal light. It enjoys uninterrupted microwave visibility to the Earth. A thick smooth regolith has supported a permanent, concrete settlement and landing areas. It also sits adjacent to regions of permanent shade, which are home to valuable gasses and water which supply Vekllei’s spacecraft with fuel, and assist in fusion research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vekllei Moon Zone has expanded several times in the thirty years of its existence. At first it claimed only a few hundred square kilometres around Mt Io, but has since come to dominate much of the territory around the moon’s Southern Pole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, it is a thriving colony of invaluable economic and psychological importance to the city-state back home. It includes Moidonnet, a city of 50,000 people with all the luxuries of home — plus a few more, like biome domes and zero-gravity museums. Traismodonnet is a military city in the Aitkin Basin that houses much of Vekllei’s classified research into fusion technology. An enormous cosmodrome sits in the Huay Crater (named after Vekllei’s largest cosmodrome on Earth), supported by a military landing site a few hundred kilometres away in the Schrödinger Crater. Prohibited zones litter the Vekllei Moon Zone, including areas allocated for hydrogen and water extraction (such as the SPA Basin Mining Zone, the largest of its kind on the moon) and the Aero Prohibited Area, which extraterrestrial landing craft and weapons in view of the disputed territories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valuable real estate is scarce on the moon, especially when costs for travel and infrastructure remain so high. The moon is rife with claims and counter-claims, which often escalate into border skirmishes. These claims sit alongside vast unclaimed territories, largely on the far side of the moon. Any claim made on this vast Terra Nullius will trigger a reaction of counter-claims, and escalate a declining world further into conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the moon today. A place of military espionage and tremendous scientific advancement, largely distributed between a handful of superpowers and Vekllei’s jewel in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MoonMonth will return tomorrow. As an interlude&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Winter 2064, the changes made to the constitution of the &lt;strong&gt;Boy Scouts of America&lt;/strong&gt; (BSA) would be felt around the scouting world. By this point it was pretty clear that the globe had entered a “helter skelter” decline towards tragedy. The emerging fission technologies were too slow and expensive to mass produce, and the fossil fuels that lighted homes around the world were starting to run dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t just a crisis of resources — there had been Taiwan, and the Commonwealth Wars, and the disaster of decolonisation. There was a long history of decline, paved in blood, and it was pretty clear that things were going to get worse before they got better. If they got better at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Winter 2064, several clauses were introduced into BSA recruitment that would reposition the organisation as a fundamentally patriotic youth org, and would seek to raise a generation of the kinds of boys and girls America would need in the coming decades. They would have to be resourceful, capable and most of all, dutiful adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese-born children were thereafter denied entry altogether, and those of immigrant heritage would be subject to allegiance testing. Over the course of a week and several indiscreet searches of the family political history, the BSA recruitment board would weed out communists and suspected agitators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an organisation of the prestige and heritage of the BSA to implement overt racial vetting meant that political repression was normalised — so-called “national orthodoxy” — in youth orgs around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vekllei the largest youth organisations include&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The National Blossoms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Puffin Scouts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Landscape Bureau&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;National Blossoms&lt;/strong&gt; concern themselves largely with traditional landcare and stewardship of national parks, and the &lt;strong&gt;Puffin Scouts&lt;/strong&gt; are focussed on camping and friendship. The &lt;strong&gt;Landscape Bureau&lt;/strong&gt; includes people of all ages, not just youth, and form part of Vekllei’s Parks and Heritage organisation (in which careers can be forged).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the constitutional reforms of the BSA, and subsequent militarisation of many European scouting organisations (as well as several so-called Western pockets of Asia), had little obvious effect on Vekllei’s youth orgs, subtle changes were made to better distinguish her domestic scouts from the rise of child fascism across the world. Parts of the uniform were demilitarised, and girls were allowed to wear skirts for the first time. The colours of the Puffin Scouts shifted from red and white, which is associated with the country as an identity, to gold and green, which better translate to “wilderness” in Vekllei Semaphore. The political curriculum of the youth orgs (covering Upen, the Bureau System and the modern Vekllei city-state) was shifted to eighteen and above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a scary time to be alive, but the children of Vekllei’s youth orgs are largely unaware of it outside of nuclear drills. Young scouts — ranked as Pufflings in the Puffin Scouts — spend their childhood years learning to tie knots and make friends, where the children of America are learning to shoot a rifle and memorise the dual constitutions; that of the Boy Scouts, and that of America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the picture above, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice a guide to decoding a simple Vekllei &lt;em&gt;Gi&lt;/em&gt;, a type of ceremonial quarter-pleat, and a collection of items a Puffin Scout is likely to have on their person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome again to MoonMonth! It started four days ago and will go until I’ve said all I can say. We’re looking at the space industry in Vekllei. This is just a quick piece I&amp;rsquo;ve done between some larger things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Copette Science Basin&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;and Rocket Factory&lt;/strong&gt; launches sixteen rockets a day. Those rockets are packed with robotic mining equipment and are sent chasing asteroids floating through our solar system. The robots return sometime in the following year with an asteroid rich with metals in tow, where they are incinerated upon entry and many tonnes of metals are plunged into empty drop zones in the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Vekllei, a resource-poor island country with an insatiable demand for steel and uranium, extraterrestrial mining has allowed the country to fund projects of great national pride. These include the moon tourism programme, the Faroe military bases, and large atomic airships for work and pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Copette Basin is a mountainous region far enough from Copette proper to launch rockets regularly. The flower-tundras that frame them are caught at once between the incomprehensibly ancient tectonic landscape and these visions of tomorrow. Old and new; agriculture and futurism — these are marks of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s schizoid relationship with the present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to MoonMonth, which started two days ago and will go until I’ve said all I can say. These posts are going to work a little differently — we’re going to follow Tzipora through her adventures in Moon City and beyond, and learn about the moon in this world along the way. Strap in!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei has put a great deal of effort into developing infrastructure for tourism across the lunar surface of the Vekllei Moon Zone. For no cost except their labour in society, a Vekllei person is able to enjoy a handful of activities in Moidonnet (“Moon City”), the largest and most recreational of the moon colonies. It is a complex of about a hundred connected buildings at the base of Mt Io, far away from the border territories of the Vekllei Moon Zone. On her 18th birthday, for which she still looked fourteen, Tzipora was gifted a week-long holiday in Moidonnet with her father, Baron, who surprised her with tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora had never got to grips with flying. She was uneasy around most things too big for her immediate comprehension. The sky and the sea and space might be grand, but she was a small girl of a provincial disposition and was satisfied with a pocket of land and some people to talk to. She had taken pills for the flight to the moon, which climbed steeply and enjoyed several hours of zero gravity, but had calmed down by the time she’d acclimatised to the novelty of life in Moidonnet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was now in a room fretting over the equipment that would separate her person from millions of miles of empty vacuum. Around her was a pink preparation room with padded walls, typical of the confined spaces of Moon City. In this gravity it only took a stumble to send you careening into the air, and the cushioning would prevent you from cracking your head open. Along the walls were metal railings available to seize in the event you lose your balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The City was distinctive in its shoelessness, as it was easy to float in the low gravity of the moon and kick things that should not be kicked. It made the whole place feel quite scientific and homely at the same time — like all tourists here were fellow travellers in some great expedition, too familial to bother with formalities like shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A heavy atmospheric suit was suspended by its lifelines to the roof. It was bulky and had strange shiny booties at the feet. Nearby were moon boots, which would be sealed along with the rest of the suit in a vacuum cocoon before test depressurisation in the airlock. The International Standard flag was hung on the wall, probably to impress foreign tourists. There were a handful of foreign tourists visiting, usually relatives of Vekllei citizens. Occasionally you saw obviously wealthy foreigners who’d payed their own way. They were easy to spot, for their gold rings and nice clothes looked absurd and tacky in the face of the glory of Vekllei infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no appetite for skirts in Moon City. The risks were too great. She’d changed out of trousers into a stiff jumpsuit bleached white with cleaning chemicals. Now that the domestic conventions of getting changed had been completed successfully, the weight of her adventure finally dawned on her. She took a seat and looked between the helmet and the body of the atmospheric suit, and felt her stomach drop. All of a sudden she missed Baron very dearly. Where had he got to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time, we’ll look at rockets. See you soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caption: “So — Mr Spaceman… How long have you held a job at Vekllei National Astrospace? 37 years?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most Vekllei people, Tzipora has visited the moon. From Ground Control on Earth in the district of Huay, Vekllei operates many moonbases, domes, research facilities and tourist opportunities in the moon’s southern hemisphere within a large complex called Moidonnet — Moon City. It sits a hundred kilometres south of Mt Io (called Malapert Mountain in the West) in the Vekllei Moon Zone. It receives shuttles several times throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time Zelda visited the moon was as a birthday gift from her father, who hadn’t been in many years. She recalls reading extensively about the moon in preparation for the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“… here’s hoping, then. So we’ve booked for three nights up in Moidonnet, and then a single night in Traismadonnet, a smaller city closer to the equator. I wanted us to do as many things as possible, so I think we should visit the peak of Io Mountain today, where they say they have a spectacular bio-dome and you can see forever, and maybe go on a space-walk. We’ll see. Spacewalks are hard to book ahead for, but if we get tired we can just do everything else the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s also an art gallery built for low gravity. It’s amazing, like a rubber castle, filled with sculpture and room pieces that are — well, they’re just amazing. You’re always telling me I’m too skinny. Guess how much I’ll weigh on the moon?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Twenty kilos?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just under ten,” she smiled, and then laughed at the idea. “You could pick me up and throw me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the rest of September I’ll be looking at Vekllei space tourism. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to cover, so stay tuned!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only had time for a quick painting tonight. Bigger things soon, after I get some things out of the way&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expo’74 was the 2074 World’s Fair, hosted in Vekllei for the first time in nearly a century. The country had made tremendous progress in recovery from the First Atomic War, and set to work nearly a decade in advance of the Expo to create a palatial fairgrounds between the districts of the Capital and Ro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The centrepiece of which was a triumph of Newda design and Vekllei civic construction: the Number 7 Plant, or Peace Reactor, which was the first commissioned molten-salt fission reactor of its type in the country to produce power. The main reactor structure is located within a pure unblemished sphere above a grand public hall and museum detailing Vekllei’s long history with nuclear power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it does not produce as much power as the country’s larger plants at 1,020 megawatts, and is frequently shut down for experiments, it is uniquely situated upon a hill in the centre of the city and is visible from almost all parts of the capital area. It is a physical testament to prosperity itself, and its public grounds are a popular attraction for locals and visitors alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a story about Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s consumption and disposal of soldiers through her foreign fighting force. You can read more about the Vekllei army in these old posts &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/chncjy/veklleis_elite_military_units_the_garden_corps/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/98trlw/allweather_combat_for_the_atomic_age/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Vekllei de ra Couismenan Desnepotet&lt;/strong&gt;, or the Vekllei Foreign Army, is an exclusively foreign fighting force employed by the National War Bureau. It accepts any person between the ages of 18 and 35. After five years or being wounded, the soldier is granted Vekllei citizenship, making the Foreign Army one of the only guaranteed ways to secure citizenship in the country. Many thousands apply each year, but only a few hundred are chosen to enter training. Out of those hundred, almost all recruits have previous military experience, and many have spent time in conflict zones as mercenaries or special forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Vekllei soldier is called a “Macker,” or “Macka,” which is Vekllei slang for a tool or implement (with origins most likely in the useless colonial wars of a century ago), and the fighters of the Foreign Army share this name. Macker slang is called Mackanese, and serves as a colourful argot that distinguishes military people from the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Army recruits are given a very different style of training to those at home. Where Vekllei people are egalitarian, laconic, and suspicious of authority, foreign recruits are taught to reverently serve the Army as an institution and maintain their status as elite soldiers. Vekllei has no qualms about allowing women to enlist in its special forces, and they are treated the same as male soldiers. Their numbers remain low among the Foreign Army population, but those that succeed are very skilled soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soldiers of the Foreign Army are stationed abroad, and command areas of Vekllei political or economic interest. Almost eighty percent are stationed in the so-called “quadrilateral of poverty,” which has corners in Hong Kong, Darwin, Johannesburg, and Casablanca. Within this shape you’ll find the interests of the world’s powers, pushed to the brink following the collapse of oil and an extraordinarily expensive arms race for over a century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While on a mission, unless food is acquired by other means, mackers eat pills. They carry three kind of pills: vitamin and performance-enhancing supplements (usually amphetamines), water disenfectants, and growables. Growables are capsules that, when mixed with water, solidify into a sort of paste that mackers call &amp;lsquo;remen soup,&amp;rsquo; after the male prime minister of Vekllei (Vekllei has both a male and female head of state). Although they come in several flavours, they invariably have the texture of cold, watery gruel and are never eaten outside of missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, all fighting folk of the Foreign Army carry &amp;ldquo;fucksticks,&amp;rdquo; a deliberately crude transliteration of &amp;ldquo;fox-sticks&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;explosive fox-hole diggers.” The firing end of a fuckstick is placed against asphalt, earth, or a wall, and after a short fuse it craters whatever is unfortunate enough to be on that end of it. In a grassy field, it will provide an emergency foxhole in otherwise flat earth. In an urban environment, it will allow entry through walls (and potentially bring the whole structure down). In the desert, it will produce a huge plume of sand that will obscure the soldier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most spectacular of the fighting man&amp;rsquo;s equipment, which otherwise distinguishes today&amp;rsquo;s equipment from that of yesteryear, is the jump-belt. Up to ten propellent canisters feed two jets that enable an ordinary person of mild athletic ability to perform superhuman jumps. They are not jet-packs; indeed, jet-packs are dangerous, specialised equipment rarely used for combat operations. Instead, a tug of a rip-cord will allow an unencumbered soldier to jump several meters, or cross a gap of up to 30 feet. While in development, the jump-belt was imagined to revolutionise infantry combat; it would allow troops to leap into second-story windows or leap across rooftops. Perhaps, it was even theorised, that someday we might do away with parachutes altogether and use belts to land instead. In reality, the jump-belt is mostly used to cross open roads or avenues, or to escape incoming fire. They are enormously unwieldy, and inexperienced troops will almost always lose their balance. In the right hands, however, they have seen success in the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National War Bureau is not a naive organisation. Outwardly the Foreign Army are foremost a declaration of power, in the child&amp;rsquo;s masculine fantasy most warlike forces rely so heavily upon; recruits are told that they are beyond good and evil; that they do what needs to be done; that they are a vanguard in the face of the forever war. The iconography and legend of the Foreign Army relies so heavily upon the masculine and the mercenary for the same reasons that the reshaping of a person’s identity is an essential part of the recruitment process &amp;ndash; to submerge a decent person into the raw language of power, and disguise the iconography of hero-worship from its praxis as a totenkopf. In a global climate where consumption has ravaged the national and spiritual identity outside of Vekllei, and force is normalised and glorified, the foreign army is legitimised and made innocent for their vast crimes across the poverty quadrilateral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They carry on, doing “what needs to be done”. It is only once they are broken and emptied by five years of indiscriminate violence, for undeclared reasons in an undeclared war, that they are shipped into Vekllei and find themselves too broken to assimilate into domestic society. So they reenlist; they are the eternal soldiers of a forever-war.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tesmosnen, the Festival of Fasting</title>

  Archived from the original article here
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the quaint ocean country of Vekllei, during their years of fecundity and fun, the calendar is divided into twelve festivals of various celebration and purpose. They include the &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-06-01-fission/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Festival of the Sea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in October, which celebrates Vekllei’s vast fishing navy and concludes with the detonation of a nuclear weapon off Vekllei’s coast, to the &lt;strong&gt;Festival of the Moon&lt;/strong&gt; in January, which is quiet and acknowledged only through personal ceremony and decorations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important festivals in the country’s animistic spiritualism, called Upen, is the Festival of Fasting. It is not a traditional fast — you are permitted to eat as much as you like. Instead, the Tesmosnen festival asks participants to either reject meat or hunt it for the duration of the festival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although by no means mandatory, during January you’ll begin to notice restaurants alter their menus and youth organisations train to hunt during the festival weeks. There is an important cultural reason that usurps the largely spiritual origins of the festival — fasting or killing forces you to acknowledge, as a consumer, the cycles of production and consumption at a most basic level. In Vekllei, which seeks a return to preindustrial lifestyles, modernisation largely abolishes the previously intimate relationship a common person had with agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a mountainous island country, Vekllei must import the majority of its red meat, and shortages are common in rural areas. Although polls show that Vekllei prefers fish as its meat of choice, it is undeniable that consumption of red meat has increased tenfold over the last few decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the three weeks of the festival, Vekllei people, including older children, are encouraged to fish or hunt as personal recreation or through environmental organisations. The act of killing and cleaning better illustrates the servile relationship the Earth now has with voracious human appetite, and this relationship forms in part the total Upen worldview.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Most Complex Machine, the Autokinotheodolite</title>

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, I drew this a little while back after getting back from Woomera, South Australia. Woomera&amp;rsquo;s a closed government town that tests missiles. Not my finest illustration, but it is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep in the mountains around Montre, above a tangle of submerged forts and ballistic missile silos, there sits a Vekllei Rocketry Corps test facility called the Strawberry Site. From the peaks of the surrounding mountains, should you evade the helicopter patrols and dog teams, you can witness the next thirty years of missile technology unfolding before you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variety of missiles, from ship-mounted seaslugs to satellite killers, are prepared and launched from the cold igneous valley. Occasionally, either to test antimissile lasers or flak, national news media are invited to witness the launch of an older declassified missile type and after which the broadcasts extoll the wonders of Vekllei missile technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special footage of all launches at Strawberry are captured using an odd device with a hefty name — the National Labs Autokinetheodolite. This machine is capable of recording high-velocity objects from very far away, and are used in civil supersonic aviation also. It sits atop a platform with the rest of the carefully-vetted news media, watching an anti-ship guided missile roar into life and sail in a graceful ark into the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Vekllei is small, and highly populated, a special prohibited air corridor guides the missiles west of Montre and out into the North Vekllei Sea. The arctic seabed is littered with many prototypes of this kind, and is patrolled regularly by navy ships to discover enemy submersibles seeking to engage in deep-sea espionage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many dozens of little trains wind their way around mountain peaks in the centre of Vekllei. They stop at upland villages and towns of sometimes only a few dozen people, before consolidating into larger terminuses that connect nearly every village in Vekllei by rail. It is possible, should the timetables align, that you can reach &lt;a href=&#34;https://i.redd.it/cv63rwy3kik31.png&#34;&gt;the capital&lt;/a&gt; from any part of the country in under 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sprawling rail network is ubiquitous with the Vekllei landscape, where images of simple agricultural life coincide with a train or tram. They are among the most beloved services of Vekllei society, from the vehicles themselves to the people that run them. Almost every precious memory and significant occasion of Vekllei life is preceded by a trip on the train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve posted another painting of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/busvvn/catching_a_steam_locomotive_to_school/&#34;&gt;Vekllei trains here&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>The Valley of Faith and Sorrow</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On her days off from her place of work in the village library, Zelda would descend the slope of the village into a great basin of creeks and flower-tundra. In the summer, when it was warm enough to sit in the sun, you could sit at one end of the valley and admire the wind rushing to meet you as it whipped through fields of flowers. For a few moments you could admire yourself for what you were — a small being in a landscape as old as the Earth. It put certain things in perspective. Some people needed to go out and look for a place that would finally make everything make sense. But, Zelda thought, sometimes you could reach the corners of the Earth and still stay where you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no greater struggle in a Vekllei person’s life than that with themselves. Work, like recreation and indeed like consumption itself, is social in this country. Most ordinary material whims of a person can be satisfied in a matter of hours, depending on the nearest station’s timetable. A handful of dreams are also accessible — a trip to the moon, for instance, is a matter of writing the Moon Office and waiting to receive tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without money, there is not much by way of commodity. And without commodity, the premises of life and identity have to be interrogated. A cultural intuition that hasn’t been seen in developed countries since before the industrial revolution has reawakened, and with it come uneasy existential questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are we doing here, on this planet? What am &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; doing here? How do I come to terms with the fact that everything is either moving away from or moving towards nothingness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the pit of material desire sits in other nationalities, the Vekllei person has a great deal of social anxiety. This phenomenon has only become more severe now that recovery from the Great Atomic War is nearly complete and Vekllei’s security in the world is mostly assured. Life for most people now engages with their immediate surrounds — family, community, and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While any combinations of these things can actualise a person, and even rehabilitate the directionless, it doesn’t work out like that for everyone. Family bonds often sever; communities can be transitory; love is elusive. Even with these things, the question of purpose is more pertinent than ever before, as the whole world approaches a reality without human labour. Just what is it that makes life worth living?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This explains, in part, why Vekllei people may not be much happier for all their enormous collective wealth. Despite the richness of their culture, optimism for their future and satisfaction with their conditions, none of these things properly emancipate the heart of utopia from its existential question — is it possible to automate humanity right out of humans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Vekllei people meet that golden horizon, and cross that rubicon, what waits for human intuition on the other side? Will it be endless days of poolsides and dinner parties? Or will it destroy the soul of our animalistic origins — leaving us desperate for value as useful people, and our purpose in work? Whatever the case may be, Vekllei is rapidly approaching it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourteen girls from the 23rd Chapel Explorer’s Club and two of their supervisors have been airlifted to safety after heavy rains overran the banks of the Rumoisen rivulet. The girls, aged between 10 and 16, found themselves stranded on the southern face of Mt Resner for three nights after the single bridge to the area’s trails was washed away in Thursday’s storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clear skies Saturday allowed air rescue services from Montre to reinforce the tiny Rumoisen Village fire brigade, and by Sunday morning a mammoth rescue operation involving two 45th Brigade helijets and several rescue teams brought Rumoisen’s girls home to safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, the risk of flash storms in early June is quite high, and are difficult to plan around,” Rumoisen Brigade Chief Toumisian de Angelo told press. “Always consult forecasts before embarking. We’re very relieved to have got everyone out safely.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chief of the 23rd Chapel Explorer’s Club announced Sunday that a wreath would be presented to their heroes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helijets are the backbone of Vekllei’s domestic air fleet. Not only are they employed in broad capacities for work, but also form a fleet of ‘air busses’ for public transport in Vekllei’s three largest districts: the Capital, Montre, and Copette. They depart from the roofs of large buildings, usually offices or department stores, and shuttle passengers to express destinations like airports or cosmodromes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They come in many forms and are manufactured by several companies in Vekllei, including the famous Ramoin-Dupont Aircraft Company and Vekllei National Aerocraft Factories, but most usually maintain flight through multiple turbojets attached to their sides and are propulsed by horizontal turbojets atop the stabilisers. By 2070, almost all are nuclear and use similar sunburst-style direct-air-cooled reactors found in Vekllei’s nuclear fighters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ones pictured here are Fire Jets, used usually for personnel transport and rescue operations, but can also be fitted with large water tanks for fighting bush and chemical fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although rotors are still used on some aircraft, most of the world has decided helijets are the future, and Vekllei, hardly coy around glamorous technologies, has followed suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tanny was twenty-five and as colourful as her flaming red hair implied. She was a once-in-a-generation editor, the kind of person who absorbed grammar rules on magical wavelengths beyond mortal comprehension and proceeded to violently enforce them. This was compounded by the Vekllei language, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://vekllei.city/language/&#34;&gt;its sublanguages and logography&lt;/a&gt;, leading to daily shouting matches in The Atlantic’s newsroom over sentence structure and colour as language. Although only a copy editor, there was no doubt in anyone’s mind that she would be head honcho one day. Already, in her youth, she wilted senior correspondents — middle-aged men — with her expressions of contempt as she thumbed her way through their drafts, licking her finger on every other page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Vekllei News Agency&lt;/strong&gt; is the bureau of the nation’s premier broadcaster and newspaper of record, and includes several companies you may already be familiar with, like the &lt;strong&gt;Vekllei Broadcasting Company&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/strong&gt; daily broadsheet. In Vekllei, a bureau is an organisation made up of the largest trade unions of the country, and is usually somewhat beholden to national direction and public interest. Many different companies can operate under a bureau, but at least outwardly the Agency is Vekllei’s singular national “public broadcaster and press”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Agency is one of Vekllei’s largest institutions and operates as a core pillar of Vekllei culture, as it publishes all matter of media material, from magazines to children’s programming. Television is popular in Vekllei, but as a particularly social country cinemas remain the most popular places to find newsreels, and documentaries are shown nationwide daily at six in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei has an endless supply of eager journalism students looking to report from abroad, and has consolidated news bureaus in almost every major city across the world, from Brisbane to Bogota. A special few go on to become war correspondents and foreign investigators, usually after receiving military training in mandatory service. Vekllei’s largest camera manufacturer, FilmFoto, produces specialised equipment for her news services that include gyroscope-mounted film cameras and portable audio equipment. Every Vekllei journalist carries a card guaranteeing them medical care across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Agency’s iconic “children’s blocks” logo has been in use since 2030, and is often simplified into three red squares without Vekllei characters. It is animated playfully to suit programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei is also home to the International Federation of Journalists, who maintain a headquarters in her Publishing District.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With nearly two dozen daily broadsheets, six news studios and countless independent rags, Vekllei enjoys a colourful and noisy media landscape that is suspended between the worlds of old and new, in a way that reflects the Vekllei as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foundations of a Vekllei neighbourhood, repeated so often to foreigners and children, is the community — a group of people larger than a family but small enough to have valuable social bonds through work and shared spaces. In a society without currency, value is almost entirely derived from your immediate surrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Municipal police, as distinct from Venrouiva police, appear in many different roles in Vekllei communities. There are officers as we’d understand them, but there are also many employees of the municipal police that deal exclusively with social work, mental health and substance dependency. These social workers, while employed by a neighbourhood police department, are not actually police officers and do not have the ability to detain people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All constables ride in cars built like European cruisers but styled like American ones, with many lights and an obvious presence on Vekllei’s empty roads. All of them are electric, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/a7ltvy/the_suburban_constabulary/&#34;&gt;motorcycles still use combustion engines&lt;/a&gt;. The type of car used varies between municipalities, but the markings are the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more of a concept sketch than anything, I&amp;rsquo;m just refining how I think it should look. Feedback appreciated, as always!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Vekllei, the economy is a social organ that lingers awkwardly between cultural and political interests. On one hand, the country is regressing (both politically and culturally) towards deindustrialised, decommodified life. On the other, it is irreversibly equipped with the benefits of automation and robotics, rendering large swathes of the labour-force obsolete. Work is now, for most purposes, a creative organ that facilitates society, culture and technology. This has led to a society not unlike most planned economies, in which employment is both essential and unnecessary, leading to vast wastage and consumption at scales a market would see as horrifically inefficient but in Vekllei is understood as an enormous social benefit. Some people must still work — so everyone must work in fairness. In Vekllei, employment is casual and often unrecorded except by the syndicates, as per the foundations of Sundress Municipalism. As long as you are working, studying or otherwise justifying a life in Vekllei (raising your children or training for competitions, perhaps), then you’ll be left alone to do what you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since everyone must work, there are many archaic jobs in Vekllei, especially for those still figuring out what they want to do with their lives. The supermarket now rules across most of the world, but in Vekllei there are only a handful of chains with few stores, simply because the provincial self-interest of Sundress Municipalism is sympathetic to individual stores populated by a community, rather than chains. The corner grocer is king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since these supermarkets are often built in imitation of the west, and are remarkably un-Vekllei, the largest three chains are illustrated above for your benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comen Grocer&lt;/strong&gt; is the only pre-Atomic War supermarket company in Vekllei, and offers mostly special-interest or foreign products. It actually operates under the same retail bureau that runs the &lt;strong&gt;Farmer’s Syndicate&lt;/strong&gt;, but is independent. It is run by a board of representatives from each store, whom are elected. Roman here has platinum hair and is a good example of an ethnically Scandinavian Vekllei person, who has descendants dating back to the 11th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joyloaf&lt;/strong&gt; operates in the Lola district of Vekllei’s capital, and is a popular day job for artistic young women who otherwise do not have the means or time to socialise with people their own age. It started as a bakery in 2064 but has since grown to stock many different kinds of foods. It is quite fashionable in Lola, and appears in cultural material originating from that district (as seen in several comics and films). Tzipora has dark hair and a round face, but blue eyes and fair skin. She is a descendent of both Inuits and Scandinavians, making her a member of the second-largest ethnic group in Vekllei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Farmer’s Syndicate&lt;/strong&gt; is both a name and a description of Vekllei’s &lt;em&gt;venrouive&lt;/em&gt; food retail arm, which means that it is beholden to the direction of the country and would be the organisation called upon to provide rations in the event of war. It is a collective of agricultural villages and organisations and operates as a distributor of these products directly. It almost exclusively stocks Vekllei products, as well as “items of cultural significance” that are traditionally eaten in ceremony and ritual, but are otherwise most popular with Vekllei’s elderly population. The Farmer’s Syndicate is the largest supermarket chain in Vekllei, but very few of its stores are actually supermarkets — many individual grocers &lt;em&gt;senrouive&lt;/em&gt; business operate under the Syndicate’s structure, but often do not brand themselves as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supermarkets are fundamentally a novelty in Vekllei, which has a vibrant cafe reputation and in which most food prepared at home is grown locally. Food production is a very important part of Vekllei culture and Upen, and the desacralising effect of chains are symptoms of an industrial, globalised society. This is an unattractive proposition to a country rapidly approaching isolationist pre-industry, in which the cycles of production and consumption are both visible and important.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Cherry Car</title>

&lt;p&gt;A road trip around Vekllei in the summer is an experience that makes life worth living. In some ways, it is a spiritual detox than reinvigorates a person with the intimate, elusive premise of the Vekllei spiritual enlightenment. In others, it is a way of returning to the earth, and understanding the human place in the principles of &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/culture/religion/&#34;&gt;Upen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter your intention, be it holiday or rediscovery, the very best of Vekllei is on display. Liberated of the desacralising effect of routine, the villages and factories you’ll zoom past take on new and extraordinary light. Removed from it, you see better how society works. The complex web of logistics, from roaring trains on adjacent rail lines to squinting at a passing nuclear flying wing through the sun roof, are now aesthetic indications of petticoat society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The All-Atomic Auto Company betrays its name instantly by not offering a single reactor-powered vehicle in its entire catalogue. Indeed, commercial reactors are so heavy that they are only realistically mounted in truck frames, even in Vekllei’s insensitivity to cost. You simply cannot fit a fission reactor into a small auto. At least, not yet. In fact, in countries where costs are concern, it is feasible that reactor technology as we currently understand it will never be economical in the frame of a small auto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AAAC is actually an industrial concern of several Vekllei venrouive bureaus negotiating commercial atomics with the future. These include famous companies like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/a64ahs/the_cosmojet/&#34;&gt;General Reactor&lt;/a&gt;, which are at the forefront of global reactor technology and compete directly with Raytheon, and Common Battery. Several lesser known, unglamorous companies also contribute to the cooperative concern. Astrotransmissions supply transmissions and Montre-Rayon Foundry provide composite steels. The AAAC has an internal design house, but most of its staff are poached from appliance manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result are a series of small, playful cars with colourful paints and a friendly look. They’re sleek and fun without being toylike, and recall remarkable household appliance designs like Fettener Kettles or Vekllei Supernational television sets. Although AAAC autos are not yet atomic, they are almost entirely electric and fueled by Vekllei’s atomic and geothermal plants, legitimising the concern’s name partially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flagship of AAAC is the Cherry, the first mass-market vehicle the company has brought to international market. Several stereotypical errors were made introducing it to the non-Vekllei world, including the unusual name and even more unusual tagline — “The Future Car for an Eternal Summer.” In Vekllei, summer is a feminine, fragrant season of warmth and rebirth. The way it was transliterated makes it seem like a reference to the world’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/c21zvo/hot_summers_in_the_arctic_and_newda_architecture/&#34;&gt;rapidly destabilising climate and ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;, which is inching the globe towards economic collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The car was a flop in the States, but saw moderate success in Europe. In Vekllei, it is one of the most common cars you’ll find in autopools today and is a favourite among road-trippers circumnavigating Vekllei’s diverse coast.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The People of Vekllei’s Railway (plus Dog)</title>

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint yellow&#34;&gt;
  ❖ This article predates the project, and &lt;strong&gt;should be considered non-canon&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m starting a series looking at the lives and machines of domestic Vekllei life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei National Railways, or ‘VK Rail’ was the bastard of six major pre-war rail companies that were extinguished along with the society that housed them. Today there are three rail companies in Vekllei, but all of them operate under direct supervision of a Vekllei Industry Bureau (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/blqcwl/utopia_the_participatory_economy_of_vekllei/&#34;&gt;making it Venrouiva&lt;/a&gt;, in other words) and are only broken up for reasons of logistics. So even though a train may run under the Montre Inclinantor Rail Company, it is fundamentally a Vekllei National Railways train much in the same way that all regional airlines are actually fully subsumed by Vekllei International Airways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few characters you’ll find at every manned Vekllei station have been illustrated below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first, the &lt;strong&gt;locomotive engineer&lt;/strong&gt;, drives a train in four hour shifts. They wear a shoulder plate to distinguish them from other miscellaneous station staff and carry a pedigree in Vekllei culture, as a country dependent almost entirely on rail internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each station has a &lt;strong&gt;station master&lt;/strong&gt;, who manages the station. In small stations, they do many types of work including maintenance and assisting public enquiry. In large stations, like Vekllei Central Terminus, there are dozens of station masters commanding multiple platforms each and are extremely demanding jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most stations also have a most unusual employee, nicknamed in Vekllei a ‘&lt;strong&gt;daughter&lt;/strong&gt;’ or ‘&lt;strong&gt;son of the station&lt;/strong&gt;,’ who are usually children or teen-agers particularly interested in entering employment with Vekllei Rail and are thus apprenticed in many different roles. They are usually taught some English in a special extracurricular programme and are used as guides for tourists, as Vekllei signage is usually written only in the country’s native tongue. After a few hours of miscellaneous works a child of the station might ride the trains, checking carriages and platforms for cleanliness and observing passenger behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, stations have been adopting &lt;strong&gt;station dogs&lt;/strong&gt; to help lift spirits among commuters and tourists alike. These dogs, usually of breeds too large for Vekllei apartment lifestyles, have no work but to meet people and offer pets to passing commuters. Some are trained in rescue and as service dogs to those who need them, but for the most part they are simply large dogs in uniform who wander with the station master or child of the station to look for love from strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At nearly 20,000kms of rail, Vekllei has one of the most dense and intricate rail systems in the world. Stations are built to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/busvvn/catching_a_steam_locomotive_to_school/&#34;&gt;receive modern transonic maglevs and century-old steam engines simultaneously&lt;/a&gt;, and nearly 15,000 people are employed in some form to keep these railways running.&lt;/p&gt;
