      <description>Archived from the original article here  The Vekllei word for a robot is automasiosn, or ‚Äòautoman‚Äô. When we talk about Vekllei being a ‚Äúpost-scarcity society,‚Äù it is by automen through which it happens. They are found across the entire country in all types of hard and boring work, forever dutiful, forever mindless. It is not that the robot has replaced the human worker, since about 90% of Vekllei people are employed.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  The New Year in Vekllei rings out during its months of darkness and cold. This calendar runs the regular affairs of the country, like it does the modern world. To Vekllei people, however, it is plain that New Years occurs not in darkness but instead in the summer solstice in June, the way it has for thousands of years in the dramatic cycles of light and dark in the country.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  There‚Äôs a thousand years of history in Vekllei‚Äôs armed forces, though you‚Äôll find very little of it recalled casually today. Almost everything about Vekllei‚Äôs prewar society was scorched by the bombs, and the scraps of military infrastructure that survived were appropriated in the subsequent British occupation.
Since independence, a slate has been wiped clean, and a modern fighting force has replaced the colonial legions and battleships of yesteryear.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  This is Bea, an energetic Botanist with the Landscape Bureau of Vekllei. People know her as an eccentric young woman easily persuaded by cottage-fashions, but she takes her work very seriously and spends most of her waking hours documenting the dense temperate rainforests of Vekllei‚Äôs coastal lowlands. These are not particularly adventurous expeditions ‚Äî most of her work is performed along old trails and paths, but Bea finds the sublime amidst the mundane and has contributed enormously to the ecological understanding of local flora in the borough of Holsyim, where she was born.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  It would be misleading to characterise Vekllei as environmentalist in the usual idea of the word. Vekllei is no such thing. This is obvious in subtle ways, like Newda‚Äôs Dumousiantopet, or ‚Äúbeautiful and seperate,‚Äù which advocates the separation of human and natural design. It is also policy; Vekllei is dependent on its landscape as part of Autosuffisouitopet, or ‚Äúself-sustenance,‚Äù and to this end sinks forests for hydroelectric dams and topples mountains for novel urban projects.</description>

This article appeared in Issue #5 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.  In Vekllei, uniforms are prevalent across all levels of society. They are perhaps the most obvious example of the opaque contradictions at the heart of Vekllei life, caught between wholly opposing ideas: between tradition and progress; liberty and control; and, most crucially here ‚Äî between individualism and the burden of society.</description>

Newda is Vekllei‚Äôs national architectural ideology, applied flexibly in a range of modernist styles developed domestically in her architecture schools. Broadly, Newda buildings emphasise distinction from the surrounding landscape (called Dumousiantopet, or ‚Äòbeautiful and seperate‚Äô), natural decay, and honesty in material and construction.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  üåº Featured in the Atlantic
This article appeared in Issue #1 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.  East of Montre, West of Tjornes, waits a rare sight among Vekllei‚Äôs hard igneous slopes ‚Äî a crown of gentle sedimentary cliffs packed with ruddy sandstone, which melt glacially into the sea chasing blue-sky bergs.
Tzipora was, at the time, making her way on foot from Montre-Lola to Ada, which was a coastal town in the North-East known for its luxurious health spas.</description>

Today:
 Up in the ro, the Vekllei flower-tundra home to spirits and people alike, green slopes and igneous monument make an ample crucible for myth and magic.
 Out here, there was a very keen sense of place and purpose. ‚ÄúLandscape‚Äù was neither revered nor ignored, since it did not exist here altogether. Every hill, rock and tree was taken at face value in its full honesty, with commodity dead and modernism suppressed.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Tzipora stood astride the bicycle luggage rack, and looked at her best friend Moise. She smiled at him, and looked to the town before them, and squinted at the clouds rising over the Atlantic horizon.
It was a warm late summer and there was salt in the air. Pebbles made better swimmers than Tzipora, but from up here she could admire the coast and fill her heart with the breeze.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Almost any other venrouive national bureau is more glamorous than Vekllei‚Äôs Hydroburo, but that fact does not detract from the organ‚Äôs critical function.
Although the sophisticated age of robotics demands the incredible yield of nuclear fission, a significant minority of Vekllei‚Äôs electricity is produced by hydroelectric dams, which are jointly operated by the Thunderburo and Hydroburo. Hydroelectricity appeals to the common Vekllei person strategically and culturally.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  The Americas Bureau at National Intelligence (AB/NI), a semiautonomous organ of the covert operations council of the War Department, is recognised as the busiest of the continental bureaus. There is a lot to be busy with ‚Äî the Dallas Secession, the Brazilian invasion of Bolivia, the Dallas nuclear lend-lease, and the reliability of Venezuelan oil production are all of some concern to Vekllei, and so AB/NI proactively has fingers in those pies.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  By 2047, Vekllei had a lot of broken men. Tens of thousands had alighted troop ships at the end of the War of Taiwan, only to find that pieces of their lives had unravelled overseas. Hardy, bronze-skinned boys were left with their ghosts, and those ghosts introduced them to drinking, and brawling, and suicide.
 As part of the Birmingham Convention and the second round of the Commonwealth War Trials, a young and recently defeated Vekllei nation was chained to a conflict that was beginning to fester in East Asia.</description>

In the days of the monarchy, it had been an unremarkable city, home to the empire‚Äôs submarine fleet. It was obliterated by bombs in the war, and the &amp;ldquo;new Montre&amp;rdquo; that has blossomed in its place is nourished by its ashes.
Among the most prolific creatures in Vekllei‚Äôs academic elite, including prestigious folk like physicist Thomas Weihennet and Chief Engineer of General Reactor Maya Ou, almost all of them were educated in Montre.</description>

Hot sand met a rising wind

      <description>Archived from the original article here  When Tzipora moved to study English and Vekllei literature at the university of Montre in 2075, she had to walk from the little home where she lived to Montre-Lola‚Äôs old concrete platform, which facilitated a single electric railcar each way, each day. If she was feeling lively, she could make it to the platform in a half hour. On the days where she dreaded sighting her plimsolls in the shoebox, it might take forty-five minutes.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Tzipora, illustrated here, is happy because her traditional dress makes her feel stylish and her cape is soft and warm.
Vekllei is an ancient culture with many inherited and vestigial artefacts. Nowhere is this more apparent than in her national dress, particularly that for women, where old and new collide as they do all across Vekllei. Pre-war, post-war and future are present here.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  The summer had rolled into the valley, and so the air smelled of hot grass from the fields. It was quiet at the station, where a single train clacked each way in the afternoon. The only sound was the wind, which caught the heads of dry grass and roared up the slopes of the mountain ranges around her.
It seemed an exaggeration to even call it a station, since the bare concrete slab had been laid fifty years ago and left to crumble.</description>

 The heavy clouds above were children of early spring, but among the steam vents it seemed like the whole sky was polluted by geysers. Large pools, opalescent with healthy minerals, were heated by the core of the Earth. In a volcanic desert of black sand, the geysers were an oasis, rising from the sulphuric fog like a little eden.</description>

Although the CN-1 Horizon Wing passenger jet was not a ‚Äúflying wing,‚Äù that didn‚Äôt stop Comen Aeroyards, the manufacturer, from celebrating it as such. Much like similar large-wing aircraft from McDonnell and de Havilland, the CN-1‚Äôs large vertical stabilisers and obvious centre fuselage precluded it from qualifying as an authentic ‚Äúflying wing,‚Äù which were already common in many air forces at this time.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  In this limited cross-section of a CN-1 ‚ÄúHorizon‚Äù Wing, the scale of the aircraft is immediately impressed upon the reader. It is nearly four times as wide as the older wide-body passenger jets of yesteryear, and twice as wide as most American and European supersonic jets. It is no coincidence that the ‚Äúflying wing‚Äù concept was only made possible by the development of supersonic jetport infrastructure, with their wide and long runways, at the turn of the century.</description>

In Vekllei economic lexicon, a bureau is the largest trade union of an industry, made up of many hundreds of others, and is partially beholden to the direction of government.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  It is very difficult to obtain papers for tourism in Vekllei as an American, despite the fact that the Arctic island nation is positioned obstinately between the Americas and Europe. It‚Äôs not made difficult for any discernible political reason, either ‚Äî relations with the U.S. are as good as they could be for a country like Vekllei. Nonetheless, tourism is regarded as a risk rather than an opportunity, and most Americans who visit for pleasure are wealthy enough to put up the sums of cash required to enter on the national carriers that exclusively operate in Vekllei‚Äôs airspace.</description>

 When you get into the idea of it, ‚ÄúThe Child‚Äù is a particularly unfortunate projection. It‚Äôs not something most would agree with, but that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs worked out in the late 2070s.

  Tzipora and Cobian, pictured here, have very different stories but both have felt something was not quite right about them. That difference, so it would turn out, would blossom into a preference for women as partners, in the unusual desexualised way Vekllei goes about homosexuality in the late 2070s.</description>

Compared to their girls, who are adorned with many layers of clothing and dazzling patterns, the schoolboys of Vekllei are unadorned. Lace and quarter-pleats give way to bolder forms and masculine colours.
As much of Vekllei‚Äôs uniform ideology straddles complex (and often precipitous) schisms of modern and traditional clothing items, boys have received considerably more progressive attention than their sisters.</description>

Life in Vekllei is filled with uniforms for work and in study, for a various historical and cultural reasons. In the late 21st century, in a society where work is social, they help distinguish and professionalise employment, which grants important psychological and social benefits.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  It is not uncommon for gangs to form in Vekllei, especially among immigrant communities otherwise marginalised by a complex logographic language and rigid belief system.
In fact, in a country of plenty, there is not much to otherwise identify with. Class is irrelevant in utopia, and the basic ideas of manhood and womanhood are being destroyed in hand with the abolishment of industry.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Welcome again to MoonMonth! It started a week ago and will go until I‚Äôve said all I can say. We‚Äôre looking at how Vekllei conquered the moon today.
Vekllei unequivocally won the space race. Not because it had the first man in space ‚Äî the Soviets succeeded in that. Nor were they the first to the moon ‚Äî the Americans had been there for nearly a century.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  MoonMonth will return tomorrow. As an interlude&amp;hellip;
 In Winter 2064, the changes made to the constitution of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) would be felt around the scouting world. By this point it was pretty clear that the globe had entered a ‚Äúhelter skelter‚Äù decline towards tragedy. The emerging fission technologies were too slow and expensive to mass produce, and the fossil fuels that lighted homes around the world were starting to run dry.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Welcome again to MoonMonth! It started four days ago and will go until I‚Äôve said all I can say. We‚Äôre looking at the space industry in Vekllei. This is just a quick piece I&amp;rsquo;ve done between some larger things.
The Copette Science Basin and Rocket Factory launches sixteen rockets a day. Those rockets are packed with robotic mining equipment and are sent chasing asteroids floating through our solar system.</description>

These posts are going to work a little differently ‚Äî we‚Äôre going to follow Tzipora through her adventures in Moon City and beyond, and learn about the moon in this world along the way. Strap in!
 Vekllei has put a great deal of effort into developing infrastructure for tourism across the lunar surface of the Vekllei Moon Zone.</description>

 Like most Vekllei people, Tzipora has visited the moon.

 Expo‚Äô74 was the 2074 World‚Äôs Fair, hosted in Vekllei for the first time in nearly a century. The country had made tremendous progress in recovery from the First Atomic War, and set to work nearly a decade in advance of the Expo to create a palatial fairgrounds between the districts of the Capital and Ro.</description>

The Vekllei de ra Couismenan Desnepotet, or the Vekllei Foreign Army, is an exclusively foreign fighting force employed by the National War Bureau. It accepts any person between the ages of 18 and 35.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  In the quaint ocean country of Vekllei, during their years of fecundity and fun, the calendar is divided into twelve festivals of various celebration and purpose. They include the Festival of the Sea in October, which celebrates Vekllei‚Äôs vast fishing navy and concludes with the detonation of a nuclear weapon off Vekllei‚Äôs coast, to the Festival of the Moon in January, which is quiet and acknowledged only through personal ceremony and decorations.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Hey everyone, I drew this a little while back after getting back from Woomera, South Australia. Woomera&amp;rsquo;s a closed government town that tests missiles. Not my finest illustration, but it is what it is.
Deep in the mountains around Montre, above a tangle of submerged forts and ballistic missile silos, there sits a Vekllei Rocketry Corps test facility called the Strawberry Site. From the peaks of the surrounding mountains, should you evade the helicopter patrols and dog teams, you can witness the next thirty years of missile technology unfolding before you.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Many dozens of little trains wind their way around mountain peaks in the centre of Vekllei. They stop at upland villages and towns of sometimes only a few dozen people, before consolidating into larger terminuses that connect nearly every village in Vekllei by rail. It is possible, should the timetables align, that you can reach the capital from any part of the country in under 2 hours.</description>

In the summer, when it was warm enough to sit in the sun, you could sit at one end of the valley and admire the wind rushing to meet you as it whipped through fields of flowers.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  The foundations of a Vekllei neighbourhood, repeated so often to foreigners and children, is the community ‚Äî a group of people larger than a family but small enough to have valuable social bonds through work and shared spaces. In a society without currency, value is almost entirely derived from your immediate surrounds.
Municipal police, as distinct from Venrouiva police, appear in many different roles in Vekllei communities.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  In Vekllei, the economy is a social organ that lingers awkwardly between cultural and political interests. On one hand, the country is regressing (both politically and culturally) towards deindustrialised, decommodified life. On the other, it is irreversibly equipped with the benefits of automation and robotics, rendering large swathes of the labour-force obsolete. Work is now, for most purposes, a creative organ that facilitates society, culture and technology.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  A road trip around Vekllei in the summer is an experience that makes life worth living. In some ways, it is a spiritual detox than reinvigorates a person with the intimate, elusive premise of the Vekllei spiritual enlightenment. In others, it is a way of returning to the earth, and understanding the human place in the principles of Upen.
No matter your intention, be it holiday or rediscovery, the very best of Vekllei is on display.</description>

Vekllei National Railways, or ‚ÄòVK Rail‚Äô was the bastard of six major pre-war rail companies that were extinguished along with the society that housed them. Today there are three rail companies in Vekllei, but all of them operate under direct supervision of a Vekllei Industry Bureau ( making it Venrouiva, in other words) and are only broken up for reasons of logistics.</description>
