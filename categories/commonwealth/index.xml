<p>An Oslolan <a href="/factbook/vekllei/#administrative-divisions">borough</a> is an unusual administrative designation, portioned originally by a set of vague criteria that includes size, history, its unique geography, culture, and its spiritual value. Population was evidently not a concern, and boroughs have great disparity in human settlement. Each borough takes the name of its largest city. You can see a partial list of them, arranged by region and alphabetically, below.</p>

<p><strong>The borough of Eyri</strong> is an administrative region on the far northwest coast of Vekllei, located in the Afouismeh Region north of <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/bakur">Bakur</a> and south of Basa. It is named after Eyri, an isolated coastal community employed mostly in controlled aquaculture by the Ocean Bureau. This quiet borough abounds with myth and legend related to its long seafaring history, emphasised only by the colossal wreck of the nearby icebreaking submarine <em>Sea Serpent</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In Eyri, the bones of an ancient beast warp and groan in the sun, red skin glinting in the whitecap churn of the shallows, oxidising, broken, ripped open by the sea.</em></p>

  History
  <a class="anchor" href="#history">#</a>

<p>Eyri was settled early in Vekllei&rsquo;s history, as sagas describe several coastal settlements established across North Afouismeh around 1000BC, suggesting a founding date similar to its neighbouring boroughs. Eyri&rsquo;s past is much more difficult to trace than its neighbours, however, as its cliffs have been significantly eroded and with them the earliest traces of settlement of the area. Like most towns of this period, Eyri relied heavily on fishing for food, and as existing fish stock was depleted near shore Eyri&rsquo;s people had to venture further and further out into open water to fish. It is often suggested that Eyri is one of several northwestern coastal boroughs responsible for the extinction of the Grey-Fin Tuna in the 16th Century.</p>
<p>For its small population of some 45,000 people, it has produced a remarkable number of famous artists, including naval painter Olivia Semesns (1863-1912) and frontman for <em>Ko Ko</em> Sizi Danosson (2015-).</p>
<p>In the early 2020s, Eyri saw tremendous investment by the Ocean Bureau into aquaculture infrastructure along its coast. Some 20% of Vekllei&rsquo;s Atlantic Salmon stock are raised here, which is remarkable considering Eyri makes up only 0.18% of Vekllei&rsquo;s human population.</p>

<p>Eyri is known best for its cliffs, which watch over fjords and beaches pummelled by enormous Atlantic swells and icebergs. Along the coast the roar of the ocean can always be heard. Eyri is also known, somewhat unfortunately, for its miserable rain and cold weather, as most of its towns are situated between the <em>Osmo</em> mountain ranges which funnel in cold arctic air.</p>

<p>Mirah is among several boroughs on Vekllei&rsquo;s West Coast settled thousands of years ago by Aleutian peoples, and many residents of Mirah have family histories that trace back hundreds of years. In 1924, the Mirah Port opened to welcome fishing traffic returning from deep Atlantic waters and Greenland.

<p><strong>The borough of Miyatvousi</strong> is an administrative region in northern Vekllei, located in the Lava Region north of Groisniyah and southwest of <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/lita/">Lita</a>. Its area is highly volcanic and is home to several natural features, including the Gismavik Dome and the Miyatsimi Geyser Fields. The area outside of the city of Miyatvousi is sparsely populated and mostly claimed by flower-tundras and Crown Land.</p>

<p><strong>Miyatvousi</strong> is an <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language/#history">Old Vekllei</a> combination of the words for &ldquo;mineral&rdquo; and &ldquo;vision,&rdquo; which in this case refer to indigenous mythos around still, mirror-like pools common to flower tundras in the area. Its name implies a connection between the physical landscape of the Miyatvousi area and the spirit world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All pools, under the dormant skin of the Earth, lead to other realms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ndash; Verse 112, <em>God Saga</em>, 11th Century</p>
<p>Although Miyatvousi has been recognised as a significant cultural site in Upen, the borough housed no major settlements until the formal incorporation of the town of Miyatvousi into the eastern dominion of the Atlantic Junta in the 17th Century. Previously, the land was inhabited by minor agricultural communities, most tending to livestock. Cultural artefacts found in the borough suggest human settlement may date back to the 10th Century, but by the end of Vekllei&rsquo;s Middle Period the borough was regarded as an empty Spirit Land.</p>
<p>In Vekllei&rsquo;s Late Period, the town of Miyatvousi remained small and agricultural, and was considered an insignificant settlement.</p>
<h3 id="postwar-development">
  Postwar Development
  <a class="anchor" href="#postwar-development">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Shortly after independence in the postwar period, Miyatvousi was surveyed by the Electric Company of Vekllei (now Magma-Electric Commission of Vekllei/Thunderburo) for its proximity to exploitable geothermal sites. In 2025, construction began on what is now the sprawling Miyatvousi Magma-Electric Power &amp; Flash Plant, which began operation in 2029 and was expanded with several satellite wells and turbine plants in the the subsequent decades.</p>
<p>The city of Miyatvousi has since become a major so-called &ldquo;Magma Town&rdquo; with a growing population employed directly by the M.E.C.</p>
<p>The town of Poka, in the south of the borough, was the setting of the popular <em>Six Rings</em> film franchise, and is a minor domestic tourist attraction.</p>
<p>The borough is now a major contributor of lamb towards Vekllei&rsquo;s food pool, and is home to several agricultural shows throughout its villages and townships each year.</p>
<h2 id="geography">
  Geography
  <a class="anchor" href="#geography">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Miyatvousi is sparsely populated and highly volcanic, and the majority of its land-area is characterised by flower-tundras, geysers, steam pools and other geological phenomena. Its largest settlements are in the east of the borough, with its west dominated by the Miyatvouosi-Lavavik Crown Lands.</p>
<p>Miyatvousi&rsquo;s Gismavik Dome is one of the largest dormant volcanoes in Vekllei, and is constantly monitored by the Volcanoes Bureau and Geological Survey for shifts in volcanic activity. The size of its magma pool is of serious concern, since an eruption would be catastrophic to the greater Miyatvousi/Groisniyah area.</p>
<h3 id="miyatvousi-mirror-pools">

  <a class="anchor" href="#miyatvousi-mirror-pools">#</a>

<p>Large coloured mineral pools are common to the flower-tundras, produced either by underground superheated springs or from runoff from geothermal power activity. The largest of these are popular local attractions, and are traditionally bathed in by locals for health or religious reasons.</p>
<h2 id="infrastructure">

</h2>
<p>Miyatvousi is linked to the coast via the Vekllei Central Highland Bullet Train, which has contributed to its postwar presence as an arterial link to Vekllei&rsquo;s North Coast. The borough is best known for its production of geothermal power and support facilities which contribute a majority amount of electricity to Vekllei&rsquo;s East Coast Supply.</p>

<p>The Miyatvousi Magma-Electric Power Plant (M.E.C.A.) is a sprawling complex of geothermal power facilities located west of the city of Miyatvousi. Expanded several times over its five-decades-long life, the facility now includes several distinct power plants, numbered 1 through 4. M.E.C.A. is a supercritical geothermal plant, and was the first of its kind in Vekllei.</p>

<p><strong>Trolls</strong> are human-sized creatures with rough grey skin and black eyes described by Vekllei sagas. They live in mountains and glaciers, where they hide in caves. If they are caught in daylight, they turn to stone. According to the sagas, the bodies of trolls eventually became the drumlins that litter Vekllei&rsquo;s mossy plains.</p>
<p>Per the legends of the sagas, the borough of Troll was the site of a troll city, which was destroyed by lava spirits. This fact contributed to its naming upon its incorporation in the early 19th Century.</p>

<p>Although Troll has a signicant cultural history within Vekllei, it is a relatively recent borough. The town of Troll received a trading license in 1823, which is considered its founding as a borough. Little is recorded about its settlement prior to its incorporation, but it is known that nomadic Algic Vekllei had remained in the area for hundreds, if not thousands of years prior.</p>
<p>Although an important cultural site in <a href="/factbook/society/culture/religion">Upen</a>, the area around Troll is highly volcanic and spiritually complicated, and its status as isolated, resource-poor land prevented permanent settlement for most of Vekllei&rsquo;s history.</p>
<h3 id="postwar-development">

<p>Troll has overall shrunk in population since the war, when many of its able-bodied adults moved to the urban coasts in search of employment. Since the late 2050s, the borough has seen a minor revitalisation after the establishment of the Vekllei Highlands Bullet Train, which links it to the larger boroughs on the coast. The economic changes under floral society have also benefited rural boroughs like Troll, since industry is less dependent on proximity to business.</p>
<p>In 2036, a major eruption from the Houismeyvik volcano disrupted air travel in Vekllei and Western Europe for eighteen days.</p>

<p>Troll is situated in the heart of Vekllei&rsquo;s volcanic highlands, surrounded by minor glaciers and meltwater rivers. It is an extraordinarily pretty borough, and is a place of dramatic hues that shift with the landscape. From its main population centre, the town of Troll, the Vatnayoskusl Glacier is visible. Its water is some of the cleanest in the world, and highly prized overseas as a health tonic.</p>
<h3 id="houismey-volcano">
  Houismey Volcano
  <a class="anchor" href="#houismey-volcano">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The Houismey Volcano, called Houismeyvik in Vekllei, is a basaltic volcano located to the north-west of an outlet glacier called Vosmaspesteh. It is a subglacial volcano situated underneath the surface, and the intersection of magma and meltwater causes phreatomagmatic explosions that can trigger eruptions. It is one of the most active volcanoes in Vekllei, though the size of its eruptions remain small.</p>
<h3 id="troll-national-park">
  Troll National Park

<p>The Troll National Park is one of seventy-two national parks in Vekllei. As a National Park, rather than a Crown Land, it is designed for human visitation and operated by Parks of Vekllei. It is located in the southwest of the borough, and its facilities include boardwalks, rest stops, and hiking trails. It is also the end point of the Vatnayoskusl Track, an extreme hiking trail that crosses the glacier.</p>
<h3 id="troll-lava-fields">
  Troll Lava Fields

<p>The Troll Lava Fields are a series of flat extinguished lava flows, which are the site of Vekllei&rsquo;s last troll city. They can be found north of Houismeyvik, and are part of the Troll Crown Land and Troll National Park. Although they are well-known within Vekllei, they are considered a site desecrated by the spirits and most visitors to the area are from overseas.</p>

<p>Troll is a minor borough that is mostly resource-poor. Its major contribution to the coasts is its abundance of clean fresh water that flows out of Vekllei&rsquo;s largest glacier, Vatnayoskusl. Although little of the glacier itself is located in Troll, most of its rivers and outlet glaciers flow through the borough, and so Troll&rsquo;s largest industries are supported by the Hydroburo&rsquo;s vested concerns in the area.</p>

<p>As a midpoint of the Vekllei Highlands Bullet Train, an auxiliary bullet train depot and maintenance yard was established in the town of Troll.

<p>&ndash; Tzipora Desmoisnes, after visiting Voya Voya for the first time</p>
<p>Voya Voya&rsquo;s area originally included several small villages founded in the early Middle Period, which by the 19th Century had developed into satellite suburbs of the industrious capital area. This expansion was encouraged by the Atlantic Junta from the mid-1850s through to the early 1930s, during which Voya Voya tripled in population. By the mid-20th Century, it had become apparent that the sprawling Capital metro area had become overextended, and threatened to link up further with boroughs in Vekllei&rsquo;s interior, beyond the glaciers. A &lsquo;green belt&rsquo; programme was announced in 1956, and saw significant portions of Voya Voya and its nearby boroughs preserved as untouchable forests. During this period, Voya Voya was known mostly as a working-class satellite to the wealthier coastal boroughs of the capital.</p>
<p>During the Atomic War, the area&rsquo;s permanent rainforest was protected from firestorms by the scorched impact craters in the neighbouring boroughs of Coyenstisn and Lava, and nearby Cusi Lake.</p>

<p>The Atomic War collapsed the capital area, and dramatically reduced the population of Voya Voya&rsquo;s neighbouring boroughs. Although the borough itself did not receive direct strikes, the subsequent fallout and social collapse saw starvation and emigration from the borough throughout occupation and into independence.</p>
<p>In the Floral Period, protections first developed by the Junta for Voya Voya&rsquo;s green belt were extended by the Floral Government, including the establishment of a <a href="/factbook/vekllei/#administrative-divisions">Crown Land</a> in its north and the clearing of rubble and replanting of rainforest throughout its inhabited interior. The architects of early independence reduced the density of the borough dramatically, clearing land for parks that now characterise the city.</p>
<p>In 2076, Voya Voya was named Borough of the Year by the Festival Commission, which saw it heavily reported by documentary films and tourism material.</p>

</h2>
<p>Voya Voya is flat and low-lying, though its border extends to the dramatic hills of the southern Thanveler Glacier. It is cool and wet, and has large areas of temperate rainforest typical of Vekllei&rsquo;s southern coast. Rainforest flora are also found in the city of Voya Voya, where tree ferns grow in alleys and in roundabouts. The city itself is medium-rise, like much of the capital, but checkered into planned areas of habitation and parkland. Aqueducts carrying water from the Hydroburo collectors in Thanveler criss-cross its streets and parks.</p>

<p>Voya Voya&rsquo;s Crown Land is an area of forbidden rainforest north of the city area, and was officially struck from Floral Government sovereignty in 2025. It remains a densely forested area belonging to the Land Sovereign, and has tremendous influence on both the culture and composition of the city.</p>
<h3 id="cusi-lake">
  Cusi Lake
  <a class="anchor" href="#cusi-lake">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Cusi Lake is a natural body of water to Voya Voya&rsquo;s southwest, which has doubled in size since the construction of the Cusi Hydroelectric Dam in 1965. Its area is split between the boroughs of Voya Voya, Lo, Coyenstisn, and Lava. As a controlled lake, it is popular for watercraft and swimming, though is extremely cold throughout the year due to runoff from distant glaciers.</p>
<h2 id="infrastructure">
  Infrastructure
  <a class="anchor" href="#infrastructure">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Although Voya Voya is best known for its parks, it is also highly accessible from the capital, linked by a variety of rail lines including bullet trains to the South Coast, Lonne and Thanveler. It is also the origin of the capital area&rsquo;s aqueduct system, a network of open-air water bridges originating in southern Voya Voya, which were first built in the 19th Century and rebuilt in the 21st. Although tourist infrastructure is sparse, it remains a popular borough for day-trips from coastal hotels, a trip made trivial by the density of the capital&rsquo;s rail network.</p>
<h3 id="the-water-commission-aqueduct-pumpworks">

  <a class="anchor" href="#the-water-commission-aqueduct-pumpworks">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The Water Commission (Hydroburo) Pumpworks in Voya Voya supplies pressure for aqueducts in the city and its neighbouring boroughs. It pulls water from both Cusi Lake and open aqueducts from Thanveler, and pushes water through an elevated network of bridges across the area. After its elevation, water is pulled by gravity with pressure from water towers. The aqueduct system provides water for all parkland in Voya Voya. The Pumpworks is a large brick/Newda facility on Cusi Lake, and its pumps are powered by on-site geothermal steam wells, as they have for a century. Small railcars called Microsweeps run along the open-air aqueducts to clear blockages and sediment.</p>

<p>The Voya Voya Botanical Gardens are a complex of green areas covering about 12 city blocks, housing mostly indigenous flora. While the Royal Botanical Gardens in Vekllei Proper feature international gardens sampling every continent on Earth, Voya Voya&rsquo;s Gardens are managed as educational public spaces celebrating local landscapes and rainforest. Its facilities include a fair and parade ground, Newda parks, lakes and ponds, rainforests, and greenhouse infrastructure. The Botanical Gardens are the site of festivals in Voya Voya, and often celebrate live music and theatre.</p>

<p>In celebration of 50 years of independence, in 2065 the Hydroburo embarked on an ambitious public art project to celebrate the South Coast&rsquo;s ancient aqueduct network. Coordinated from Voya Voya, the site of the Aqueduct Pumpworks, Voya Voya&rsquo;s aqueducts were embossed with tiled murals over the course of about ten years, and were finally completed in March 2076. Its contruction employed nearly 1,500 artists and locals in its peak. Voya Voya&rsquo;s aqueducts are widely recognised as some of the most beautiful pieces of civic infrastructure in the world.</p>

<p><strong>The borough of Bakur</strong> is an administrative region on the far northwest coast of Vekllei, located in the Afouismeh Region north of Tanger and south of <a href="/factbook/vekllei/boroughs/eyri/">Eyri</a>. It is named after Bakur, an ancient fishing town with history that predates unified settlement in Vekllei. It has the smallest population of any borough in Vekllei, at only 7,500 permanent residents, which fluctuates seasonally. It is most famous for being home to the site of Vekllei&rsquo;s Deep-Sea Cartography Mission, an initiative of the Ocean Office of the Vekllei Government. This also means Bakur has the highest population of scientific personnel per capita of any borough in Vekllei.</p>

<h2 id="history">
  History
  <a class="anchor" href="#history">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Artefacts recovered from north of the town of Aya in Bakur date to nearly 1000BC, approaching earliest estimates of known settlement in the Vekllei Home Islands. Bakur&rsquo;s first residents were likely nomadic arctic peoples immigrating from nearby Kala (Greenland) looking for hunting grounds in winter. Sagas confirm the town of Bakur was established in the 14th Century AD to support the creation of an arctic naval fort, but the fort was abandoned less than a hundred years later and few residents remained, leaving Bakur mostly abandoned until the early 19th Century, when it was reestablished as a base of operations for Vekllei&rsquo;s colonial whaling fleet. Today it remains a shrinking fishing town, bolstered only by seasonal workers imported by the Ocean Office.</p>
<p>The town is the birthplace of celebrated Vekllei folk songwriter Tohs Viskaismesn (1847-1912).</p>

<p>The Bakur borough is home to some of Vekllei&rsquo;s most spectacular subarctic scenery, dominated lava slopes, ice fields, and fjords. Its position among the Westernmost boroughs in Vekllei makes it a great staging town for Vekllei&rsquo;s expansive fishing fleet, including line and trawling vessels.</p>

  History

</h2>
<p>Holsyim was founded as a fishing village in the late 19th century, but it&rsquo;s likely that it was inhabited for many hundreds of years before that in smaller, undocumented settlements. The emergence of a new volcanic islet in 1942 was first reported by residents of the nearby village of Spisek, now known as Little Island. The town of Holsyim is home to an annual nude swim each winter.</p>

<p>Holsyim is well known for its adjacency to the Holsyim Crown Land, a preserved area of temperate rainforest that hosts thousands of different species of plants, animals and mosses. As Crown Land, it remains undeveloped and officially unrecognised by the Vekllei government, but nonetheless is documented extensively by local ecologists. The town of Holsyim sits on Vekllei&rsquo;s Southern Coast, and has some of the largest beaches in the Vika Region.</p>

<p><strong>Kalina</strong> (commonly <em><strong>The Kalina Islands</strong></em>) is a sovereign commonwealth island chain situated in the Antilles, situated south-east of the British Virgin Islands and north of Guadeloupe. In the anglophonic world, it consists of the island cherishes of Anguilla, St Martin, St Kitts and Nevis, Antigua, Barbuda, and Montserrat. In the Kalina language, these are called Angua, Martin, Liamuiga and Oualie, Antam, Barbuda, and Montesur respectively. These islands are federated under the Kalina parliament, which itself is a full member of the Vekllei commonwealth.</p>

</h2>
<p>The Kalina Islands have been inhabited for thousands of years by Carib peoples called the <em>Kalinago</em>, who make up the majority of Kalina&rsquo;s 350,000 people today. Traditionally seafaring and seminomadic, Kalina and its neighbours in the Lesser Antilles were devastated by the arrival of Europeans in the 16th Century. Kalina was originally colonised by almost all colonising nations of the European colonial period, but were eventually united under Spanish rule in 1638 as part of the Treaty of Barbuda and the end of the Franco-Spanish War.</p>
<p>Kalina was purchased from the Spanish by the Vekllei city-state in the late 17th Century, and indicated Vekllei’s initial intention to exploit the New World. This ambition was scuppered with the collapse of the Vekllei monarchy, which established forts across Kalina&rsquo;s islands but could not muster the resources to occupy continental America. Vekllei’s colonial efforts were blunted for centuries after, and excluded the country from major participation in the slave trade and the colonisation of Africa.</p>
<p>Vekllei was forcibly decolonised during British occupation between 2005 and 2015, and Kalina during this period was reorganised as a British territory. After independence in 2015, the Vekllei Home Islands renegotiated Kalina&rsquo;s independence as a member of the Vekllei Commonwealth (alongside other former colonial posessions), which was established in 2017.</p>
<p>Today, the Kalina Islands are the most populous member of the Vekllei Commonwealth, and has thrived in the Floral Period as an new country under its own government.</p>
<h2 id="geography">

  <a class="anchor" href="#geography">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Kalina is tropical and partially volcanic, incorporating hundreds of islands and islets that form a boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. Kalina comprises most of the Leeward Islands of the Lesser Antilles, and is composed mostly of low-lying tropical islands ranging in size from a few hundred square kilometres to sand reefs.</p>
<p>Montesur is actively volcanic, and sees minor eruptions every few years.</p>

<p>Kalina shares the Vekllei city-state&rsquo;s unusual parliamentary system and geographic electoral districts. The country is independent, but like other full members of Commonwealth it shares much of its constitutional legislature and state structure with the Vekllei city-state. The Crown Armed Forces are responsible for defence of Kalina, which also contributes personnel and land to the supranational defence initiative. The Kalina Islands are positioned strategically in the Caribbean and host several important military facilities throughout its island chains. The Commonwealth also coordinates Kalina&rsquo;s foreign affairs through the Overseas Affairs Office of the Commonwealth Culture Secretariat.</p>
<p>The Kalina Parliament acts as a federal parliament for the smaller, national island cherishes it governs. The Cherishes are semiautonomous and maintain their own ministries, but their legislatures are consolidated in the Kalina Parliament.</p>

<p>The <a href="/factbook/society/government/#parliament-of-the-commonwealth">Commonwealth of Vekllei</a> is a multinational political, defensive and trading bloc that includes the Vekllei City State, Kala, Aismious, Demon, Azores, Mira, and Kalina. It includes territories of the Vekllei city-state (Kala, Aismious, Demon) and independent countries (Azores, Mira, Kalina) that are closely aligned with postwar Floral constitutional principls and Bureau economics. In this sense, most of the commonwealth closely resemble Vekllei&rsquo;s society.</p>
<p>Vekllei uses a Hare-Clark single transferable vote system to elect two prime ministers, one man and one woman, the only such system in the world. Vekllei has a bicameral legislature, consisting of an upper house (the <em>Crown Senate</em>) of 100 senators and a lower house (<em>People&rsquo;s Assembly</em>) of 200 members. Although voting is participatory and the country does not maintain a poll tax, electoral enrolment is mandatory from age 16 onwards.</p>
<p>Since Vekllei is nonpartisan, it does not allow formal participation of parties within elections. Despite this, informal associations of elected representatives exist, in the form of <em>sociopartit</em>, or <em>Party Associations</em>. The largest of these include the Vekllei Industrial Working Concern, the Atlantic Party, and the Crown Brotherhood, and although membership is permitted among elected members they are otherwise disallowed within the electoral process.</p>

<p>Krafla is named after the petty demon Fismiosn Krafla mentioned in the <em>Saga of Origins</em> and <em>Saga of New Earth</em>. The demon was murdered by the Early God Vis for his planned coup of the First Palace. Krafla was buried in the far west of the current borough boundary, deep beneath the Hagsoraefi Lava Fields.</p>

<p>Some of the boroughs, they just sort of made up, didn&rsquo;t they?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ndash; Tzipora Desmoisnes</p>
<p>Like many of Vekllei&rsquo;s interior boroughs, Krafla&rsquo;s origins are agricultural. It is named after the demon Fismiosn Krafla, vanquished in the <em>Saga of New Earth</em> in Upen mythology. Until the 19th Century, Krafla was inhabited by a handful of farming settlements and seminomadic Algic tribes. Fording the Joskuslsa river was rare until borough unification, and settlements either side of the river were largely isolated. By the 17th Century, most permanent settlement east of the Joskuslsa had died out.</p>
<p>Krafla was insulated from Christianisation of northern Vekllei in the 15th and 16th Centuries, and has been dominated by Algic Upenist beliefs since its earliest recorded settlement in the 4th Century.</p>
<p>In 1911, the Krafla Hydroelectric Dam collapsed, washing away much of Krafla&rsquo;s downstream riverside township and killing nearly half the population of the town. Krafla was rebuilt at a higher elevation.</p>
<p>The borough remained heavily agricultural up until the Atomic War, comprising mostly of traditional co-operative farms.</p>
<p>In the Floral Period, life in Krafla remains agrarian, but the borough does attract some regional tourism as a thoroughfare into the deeper highland interior.</p>
<h2 id="geography">
  Geography
  <a class="anchor" href="#geography">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Krafla is extremely flat, glacial and dominated by lava fields. Snow settles across its wide basalt plains and contributes to seasonal melting that feeds into the Joskuslsa River. Krafla has extraordinarily fertile soil, and its satellite farm towns of Krafla-Vis and Voya Vema are dominated by centuries-old farming communities. The &lsquo;Borough Town&rsquo; of Krafla resembles a moonscape.</p>

<p>Krafla&rsquo;s historic agricultural community, including several large stone structures, were swept away in the 1911 Krafla Dam Disaster. The dam collapse flooded the town, killing 48 people. Most of the town was not rebuilt. The ruins of the larger stone structures are still visible in winter.</p>

<p>The Joskuslsa River, Vekllei&rsquo;s second-longest river, flows through Krafla. It is the source of major flooding in the low-lying areas of West Krafla, and features several canyons leading up to the Three Crown Falls in neighbouring Kotaismoyeh.</p>
<p>The river is a discharge of the Vatnajoskusl ice cap, and is a fast-flowing glacial river with the highest flow in the country. It is bridged in Krafla by the New Oak Bridge, which was constructed in 1952.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>&ndash; Retelling of Algic legends, Verse 880, <em>Saga of New Earth</em></p>
<p>In the highlands on the far side of the Joskuslsa river are Krafla&rsquo;s mysterious &ldquo;empty basins,&rdquo; unique geological formations that appear as shallow craters. They are covered by a layer of basalt crust, and are likely much deeper than they appear. The slopes of the basins are flush with flora and fauna, and the deepest of them, called &ldquo;Fismisosndera,&rdquo; features a small lake at the bottom.</p>

<p>Krafla is dependent on its arterial M224 highway and regional rail connections. As part of the agricultural belt in the north glacial lava fields, Krafla lacks heavy industry or the presence of bureau commerce. It is a traditional borough characterised by Vekllei co-operative (<em>socialistzesm</em>) farms and minor regional tourism.</p>

<p><strong>The borough of Lita</strong> is an administrative region in the east of Vekllei, located in the Lava Region west of Copette and south-east of <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/krafla/">Krafla</a>. It is named after Lita, its largest population centre and science town nestled in the glacial basins made by millions of years of freshwater runoff. It is well-known in Vekllei as the site of the Lita Cosmodrome, the primary launch site for industrial and scientific spacecraft. It is also the <em>de facto</em> headquarters of the <em>Cosmos Office</em> (Cosmoburo), even if its operations remain <em>de jure</em> centred in Vekllei Proper. The population of the town of Lita and its neighbouring villages is heavily affected by the Cosmodrome, transforming the borough into one of the primary astronomy and astrophysics hubs of the country.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Royal Borough of Lita was not far from Copette, one of the Five Crown Boroughs of Vekllei, but this was Vekllei’s glacial interior and it felt a million miles from anywhere.

<p>Lita is relatively isolated from the coasts by its dramatic mountain ranges and glacial terrain, and remained uninhabited until the establishment of the Vekllei Missile Programme in the mid-20th Century. Lita first served as a closed government town supporting the Vekllei Rocketry Corps (today the <em>Rocket Navy of the Vekllei Commonwealth Armed Forces</em>). Lita was occupied by the British military during occupation. Since independence, the town has opened and is served by multiple rail lines from the capital, including the <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/miyatvousi/">Miyatvousi</a> bullet train.

<p><strong>Lola</strong> is the spirit-god of the sea in <a href="/factbook/society/culture/religion">Upen</a> mythology, and is generally considered Vekllei&rsquo;s most important living spirit. Since Vekllei is an island country with a historical dependence on the oceans around it, Lola has long blessed Vekllei with plentiful fish stocks and, beginning in the 19th Century, an improving temperate climate via the Atlantic Gulf Stream. The name Lola appears throughout Vekllei, though the borough predates its use elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="history">
  History
  <a class="anchor" href="#history">#</a>
</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only seen the sea three&hellip; Four other times before&hellip; And let me tell you, this is the best of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ndash; Tzipora Desmoisnes</p>
<p>Lola has been settled for at least 3,000 years by Vekllei&rsquo;s Algic peoples, when it was known as Oslola. Reykjavic, located on the eastern peninsula of Lola, would become the first settlement inhabited primarily by European Scandinavians in 1100BC, when it was named &ldquo;Smoke Cove&rdquo; for its geothermal springs by Norsemen. The interactions between Vekllei&rsquo;s indigenous Oslolans and Norsemen are among the earliest recorded, and are considered the beginning of Vekllei ethnic and cultural diffusion that contributes to many of the contemporary cultural features of Vekllei today. In this sense, Reykjavic is the birthplace of modern Vekllei, and would become the seat of power for successive regimes that united the island under a common government.</p>
<p>Reykjavic and its surrounding villages were agricultural for most of Vekllei&rsquo;s Common Period until the rise of Vekllei&rsquo;s monarchy in the 3rd Century, which established Oslola as the capital of Vekllei and Reykjavic as its seat of power. This time saw Reykjavic grow dramatically as it developed into the military and economic base of the monarchy, which succeeded in establishing the state of Vekllei and uniting its southern coast under its rule. By Vekllei&rsquo;s Middle Period in the 8th Century, Vekllei was a powerful port city-state predicated on continental trade in Reykjavic&rsquo;s docks.</p>
<p>Vekllei&rsquo;s Late Middle Period saw multiple famines and peasant uprisings by Vekllei&rsquo;s Norse ethnic population, which succeeded in instigating a civil war that installed Aismo Desimou as king. Although the name &lsquo;Vekllei&rsquo; had been in use since at least the 3rd Century, it was under Deismou&rsquo;s rule that the island commonwealth became known as the Commonwealth of Vekllei, with a formal capital established west of Reykjavic in the present-day neighbourhood of Altanehs. The western coastal region of Lola would continue to grow outwards during this time, and farmland had reached the Esja Mountains by the 13th Century.</p>
<p>As Desimou-era rule failed in the 14th Century, Reykjavic&rsquo;s influence over the commonwealth waned and saw powerful economic towns established on Vekllei&rsquo;s East Coast during the Period of Rest. Rising concerns over Algic nationalism saw the Commonwealth Navy launch a coup against the Reykjavic monarchy and topple the king, installing a junta known under several names in its place. The renewed colonial ambitions of the Junta established Lola as a colonial metropole, and the wealth of Vekllei&rsquo;s Late Period transformed the borough. Reykjavic by this time had come to resemble a continental European capital, with an urbanising cityscape marked by stone fortresses and elaborate public gardens.</p>
<p>Lola would remain the capital of Vekllei throughout Vekllei&rsquo;s Late Period and into the 20th Century, until the destruction of Reykjavic in the First Atomic War and its occupation by the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The Atomic War saw nuclear strikes in Reykjavic and Geofyourd, destroying both the Junta&rsquo;s Palace of the Commonwealth and most of the Port of Vekllei. The port was reconstructed under British occupation between 2005 and 2013, but the Palace was unsalvagable and to this day remains a preserved ruin.</p>
<p>Upon independence, the <a href="/interim/">Vekllei Interim Government</a> moved the capital of Vekllei to the newly-founded Borough of Vekllei (also known as Vekllei Proper) on the South Coast, which would become a planned city home to most of the country&rsquo;s political structures and bureau headquarters. The reconstruction of Reykjavic and decontamination of Lola took over fifteen years, and radically changed the appearance and demographics of the former capital. Agriculture was reintroduced into the neighbourhoods of Alveg and Hosfyourd to combat Vekllei&rsquo;s 2016 famine and the construction of the Southwest Canals in the 2020s saw most of southern Lola industrialise rapidly.</p>
<p>Lola has historically been a multicultural borough because of its status as a colonial metropole, and this trend was intensified under the rapid growth of the Floral Period. Boroughs like Seispri have large Southern European communities, and nearby Vogah is one of Vekllei&rsquo;s few historically black neighbourhoods comprised mostly of descendents of Caribs.</p>
<p>Lola in the contemporary Floral Period is a borough of hills and narrow, prewar roads symptomatic of its history. It is a major manufacturing borough in contemporary Vekllei and is home to some of the country&rsquo;s greatest design firms and artisans, whose works are often the products of knowledge inherited through thousands of years. It is also a modern borough of cosmopolitan and forward-facing dispositions, home to a people who have inherited the trauma of the Atomic War and are eager to leave it behind.</p>

<p>Lola is coastal and low-lying, and is made up of peninsulas, islands, islets, coves and straights. During the Ice Age, it was covered by a glacier. The borough is threatened by rising seas, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.</p>
<p>The neighbourhoods of Lola cover almost all of the borough, which has no contemporary Crown Lands. The borough does feature substantial parkland in the neighbourhoods of Seispri, Alveg and Geofyourd, which extent up into the Esja Mountains.</p>
<p>The climate is coastal and temperate, seeing mean temperatures of 20C in summer and about 5C in winter. Snow settles in Lola for one or two weeks in the winter, and for most of the season in the Esja Mountains.</p>

Historically industrial, today it is primarily settled by Southern and Eastern European migrants who arrived in the early 2020s. It is relatively material-poor and working-class, and is still marked by war ruins. It is known for its canvas industry.</p>

</h3>
<p>The Esja Mountains are a range located north of Reykjavic, marked by Mt Esja at 910m above sea level, its highest point. The mountain is situated in the borough of Geofyourd, and has been settled up to 500m. Its iconic peaks are unusually light-coloured because of extensive Rhyolite deposits, a byproduct of volcanism. Esja is a popular hiking destination among locals, but can be dangerous in winter because of the greater risk of avalanches.</p>

<p>The Lola Geothermal Springs are located in Camro, in eastern Lola. Now part of a public park, there are some 250 geothermal pools that give off heavy steam year-round. About half are safe to bathe in, and form part of Camro&rsquo;s famous Bath District.</p>

<p>With industry inherited from a thousand years of settlement, Lola remains a major manufacturing base of Vekllei. In the Floral Period it is characterised mostly as a working-class suburb of migrants and manual labourers, a trend that continues today. Much of its heavy engineering is a legacy of the borough&rsquo;s status as a colonial port, and among Lola&rsquo;s oldest companies are shipbuilding firms that have existed for over 600 years.</p>

<p>Lola is serviced by Vekllei Rail West, a part of <a href="/factbook/society/industry/rail/">Vekllei National Rail</a>. Like most boroughs of the Capital Region, it is heavily serviced by trams.</p>
<p>As a coastal borough, Lola is home to the historical Port of Vekllei, one of Vekllei&rsquo;s major deepwater ports. Unlike the Dohyo Free Port, the Port of Vekllei services mostly Commonwealth-flagged ships and naval vessels.</p>

<p>The Vekllei Naval Yards are the primary drydocks, nuclear refueling facility and ship construction base of the Royal Navy of the Vekllei Commonwealth. The Naval Yards make up some 12 city blocks in the neighbourhood of Hosfyourd in Nismisn Bay, and are primarily tasked with maintaining Vekllei&rsquo;s bluewater naval vessels and aircraft carriers. Adjacent to the Naval Yards are firms contracted by the Commonwealth Navy, including Dze S.q.M. and Propeller S.q.M. The facility is also home to the Vekllei Naval Museum, which features preserved examples of Late Period sailing ships and Vekllei&rsquo;s first nuclear destroyer, the R.C.S. <em>Desimousves</em>.</p>

<p>Government House is a building located in Altanehs, near the ruins of the Palace of the Commonwealth. It was part of Vekllei&rsquo;s People&rsquo;s Assembly during the Junta period, a minor legislative advisory body to the autocratic regime of that time. It is not the oldest such structure in Vekllei &ndash; the Parliament House in Althing predates the construction of Government House by nearly 600 years. Still, it remains next to the Palace of the Commonwealth as a physical legacy of Junta&rsquo;s long rule, and is preserved as a museum of the Late Period.</p>

<p>The Vekllei Cenotaph is a monument to all Vekllei servicemen killed during wartime. Its main feature is a 60 meter oblisk at the top of Memorial Hill, built out of granite. At its base is a list of every war in which Vekllei was a participant, and its surrounding grounds contain nearly 400 memorial stones with names of fallen soldiers enscribed. Its contents is mostly historical, since contemporary rememberence takes place at the Vekllei War Memorial in Vekllei Proper, and Atomic War rememberence at the Atomic War Memorial in the neighbouring borough of Lava.</p>

<p>The Royal Hotel of Vekllei, shortened to the Royal, is among Vekllei&rsquo;s oldest operating hotels and also its most luxurious, catering primarily to the international wealthy and the famous. Unlike Hotel International in the borough of Callaisn, most of the Royal&rsquo;s guests visit for pleasure rather than business. Part of the Royal Hotel complex includes the former Summer Residence of the Vekllei Monarch, inside of which are Vekllei&rsquo;s most expensive (and exclusive) hotel suites. The Hotel is serviced by a dedicated untimetabled train line that runs between the Royal Hotel in Hosfyourd and the <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/pharos/#vekllei-world-jetport">Vekllei World Jetport</a> in <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/pharos/">Pharos</a>.</p>
<p>The Royal is ranked among the world&rsquo;s most luxurious hotels and is a subject of fascination for Vekllei people, who are unlikely to ever visit it unless accompanying a paying foreigner.</p>

<p>The abundance of volcanic springs in the neighbourhood of Camro has encouraged Vekllei people to bathe there for over a thousand years. These springs are now at the centre of the Camro Bath district, an area of the neighbourhood famous for its bath houses. These include the Atlantic Baths, its most prestigious institution, as well as themed and roman-style bathing facilities. These baths are tremendously popular among locals, who often travel between boroughs to reach them for the quality of their facilities and superstition of the geothermal pools.</p>

<p>Lola&rsquo;s east is home to several combined heat and power plants, which produce both electricty and useful heat from natural geothermal activity. As part of Vekllei&rsquo;s commitment to decentralised electricity, three plants provide the majority of Lola&rsquo;s power and heat (numbered S.M.1 through 3), which are operated by Vekllei&rsquo;s Magma-Electric Commission. Useful heat is piped into Lola&rsquo;s homes, but is also used to power large geothermal greenhouses that contribute fresh produce for Lola&rsquo;s markets.

<p><strong>The borough of Mumen</strong> is an administrative region on the southwest coast of Vekllei, located in the Capital Region south of Pharos and west of Little Vekllei. It is named after Mumen, the city neighbourhood to which it belongs. It is home to one of Vekllei&rsquo;s primary immigrant processing centres, and now hosts a thriving immigrant community populated mostly by Southern Europeans. It is best known for its touristy seaside and bright white beaches, which take advantage of Southwest Vekllei&rsquo;s warm gulf climate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The main beach in Mumen, the nicest of the seaside districts, is constructed out of sand imported from the dunes of Africa. Where the rest of the country has black sand, a symptom of its volcanic turbulence, Mumen has nice yellow sand.</em></p>

<h2 id="history">
  History
  <a class="anchor" href="#history">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Although people have lived in Mumen since the earliest days of Vekllei settlement, the Borough of Mumen was incorporated in 1996 from two previously existing municipalities, called <em>Sizm</em> and <em>Musma</em>. When we talk about Mumen today, we usually talk about its vibrant immigrant fusion cultures, made up of Greeks, Croations, Italians and Spanish migrants that arrived throughout the late 20th Century.</p>
<p>In the late 1990s, Mumen was revitalised as part of a broader effort towards modernising Vekllei&rsquo;s tourist infrastructure, much of which survived the atomic bombing. The borough&rsquo;s signature white beaches, along with its seaside resorts and promenades, were constructed during this time. Although highly visited by foreign and domestic tourists alike, the city of Mumen is less travelled, and retains the dense migrant community districts of its prewar years. It has some of the best food in the Capital Region.</p>
<p>The town is the birthplace of former Prime Minister Come Des Desvouisan (1982-2067).</p>

<p><strong>The borough of Ou</strong> is an administrative region in the central Ro Highlands of Vekllei, located southwest of Laisiyo and north of Kyala. It is named after Ou, a prominent agricultural town of Vekllei&rsquo;s Middle Period that was transformed in the 20th Century into the cultural and military centre of the Ro Region. At nearly 1.2 million residents, Ou was narrowly excluded from becoming one of Vekllei&rsquo;s five Crown Boroughs in 2021, but remains the second-largest borough of the Ro Highlands, after Lonne. Its importance to <a href="/factbook/society/culture/religion/">Upen</a> leads most Upen-observing Vekllei people to regard Ou as a sacred borough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Many townsfolk in Ou are employed in operation of the dam, either through the Thunder or Hydroburos. It is also the site of a small Vekllei National University laboratory which examines the dam environment and trains its staff.</em></p>

<h2 id="etymology">
  Etymology
  <a class="anchor" href="#etymology">#</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Ou</strong> is a <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language/#history"><em>Topyas</em></a> pure <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language/#diphthongs">Ocean Vowel</a> meaning &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; or &ldquo;personhood&rdquo;, and in its written form is considered a core <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language/#4-rapotenne">Rapotenne</a> rune in <a href="/factbook/society/culture/religion/">Upen</a>. Ou is regarded as the birthplace of demons in Upen mythology, who emerged from the Valley of the Dead to return humans to the spirit world. For this reason, Ou is considered a sacred borough in Vekllei and much of its territory remains untouchable <a href="/factbook/vekllei/#administrative-divisions">Crown Land</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">
  History
  <a class="anchor" href="#history">#</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Ou</strong> was settled originally as a rest stop between the burgeoning trading town of Montre and the southern port city of Vekllei circa 1440, and by 1480 had developed into a &ldquo;glorious township&rdquo; subject to the sovereign monarch of Vekllei. Its settlement was originally plagued by crop failure, which was considered a curse for encroaching on the sacred land of the nearby Valley of the Dead.</p>
<p>In 1520, as a result of the ongoing food scarcity in the wake of the Junta&rsquo;s rebellion, Ou suffered a famine that killed the majority of its population.</p>
<p>In the late 19th Century, Ou was incorporated into the Atlantic Junta&rsquo;s electrification program, which incorporated the borough and its major towns into the Southern Vekllei power network. The town of Ou was a major staging point for network extensions northward, which would see Montre electrified in 1886.</p>
<p>The town is the birthplace of Yelsi Visma (1976-2063), who represented Vekllei in gymnastics at the 2000 Paris Olympics and was the recipient of the 2025 Vekllei Person of the Year.</p>
<h3 id="significance-in-upen">
  Significance in Upen
  <a class="anchor" href="#significance-in-upen">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The <em>Saga of Spirits</em>, an undated oral myth dating at least to 150BC, describes the region around Ou as the birthplace of demons.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[There were] sick mountains, falling to spirits, between Sko and Nuc [present-day Mt Scohe and the Adey Range], the spirit went there to die, and from the place he died emerged a creature of misfortune, blessed by Ku [god of death].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ndash; Verse 16, <em>Saga of Spirits</em></p>
<p>Demons in <a href="/factbook/society/culture/religion/">Upen</a> are creatures that emerge from the places spirits die, and access the human world through the resting places of souls (most commonly flower-tundras). The <em>Saga of Spirits</em> suggests that demons were created accidentally by a selfish spirit and the death of a wicked man, and that Ku, the god of death, learned from this event how to entice their creation.</p>
<p>As demons remain an important aspect of Upen mythology, Ou&rsquo;s Valley of the Dead (the place described in the passage above) is regarded as one of the most sacred sites in Vekllei. Its closest town, Tiamoin, is the site of Vekllei&rsquo;s Festival of Rest, a spectacle designed to attract the attention of demons to allow human souls easy passage to the spirit world. Since the Valley of the Dead&rsquo;s flower-tundra is considered especially close to the spirit world, many other rituals take place here, including <a href="/posts/2020-04-01-ego/">sumoirnesdenen</a> (ego-death) and communion with spirits.</p>
<h3 id="hydrotown-development">
  Hydrotown Development
  <a class="anchor" href="#hydrotown-development">#</a>
</h3>
<p>In 1912, Vekllei&rsquo;s dwindling economic outlook and failing electrification programme led the governing Atlantic Junta to explore the establishment of hydroelectric dams, to put the unemployed to work and stabilise the southern power network. The construction of Ou&rsquo;s first dam in 1916 marked the beginning of a broader hydroelectric initiative in the region, which had a radical effect on the cultural makeup of the borough. Two of Ou&rsquo;s major towns, Ada and Tiamoin, were first founded as &ldquo;hydro towns&rdquo; by migrant Chinese labourers employed by the Hydro-Electric Commission (HEC), which to this day represent major centres of Vekllei&rsquo;s Chinese population.</p>
<p>After major construction by the HEC ceased in the early 1930s, Ou&rsquo;s towns continued to support the hydro infrastructure and power plants that supplied electricity to Vekllei&rsquo;s north coast in Afouismeh and Lava.</p>
<h3 id="postwar-redevelopment">
  Postwar Redevelopment
  <a class="anchor" href="#postwar-redevelopment">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Shortly after independence in 2015, Ou was ranked by the Vekllei War Recovery Bureau as a borough of &ldquo;critical need&rdquo;. Its preexisting status as a Hydro Borough prompted research towards the expansion of the newly-formed Hydroburo&rsquo;s presence in the area, looking to replicate the prewar success of the borough&rsquo;s original hydroelectric initiative.</p>
<p>In 2018, new construction began on the Ou Hydroburo Office, a pumping and power plant complex designed to establish a postwar Hydroburo presence in the borough and supply fresh water to communities in the Ro Region. The construction accompanied a housing revitalisation effort towards the city of Ou and its nearby towns, building new apartments and parks to facilitate immigration from Southern Europe after the Atomic War.</p>
<p>The Floral Period in Ou, much like the rest of the country, was marked by widespread immigration and population growth, which saw the city of Ou double in size between 2015 and 2046.</p>
<h2 id="geography">
  Geography
  <a class="anchor" href="#geography">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Ou lies in the heart of the central Ro Highlands, a region dominated by dramatic mountain ranges, minor volcanoes, and flat highlands flower-tundras central to the Vekllei physical identity. Ou is known especially for the density and beauty of its flower-tundras, making it a popular tourist region and pilgrimage destination for Vekllei people. All of Ou&rsquo;s major towns are shielded by its surrounding mountains, keeping weather mild and clear throughout the year. Ou also receives good sun, and is considerably warmer than its southwestern neighbours. It is also home to Stelavik and Cosmivik, two active volcanoes that erupt periodically.</p>
<h3 id="valley-of-the-dead">
  Valley of the Dead
  <a class="anchor" href="#valley-of-the-dead">#</a>

It is one of the largest such tundra in Ou, covering nearly 2000 acres west of Tiamoin.

<p><strong>The borough of Pharos</strong> is an administrative region in the south-west of Vekllei, located in the Capital Region on the Coast of the Americas, north of <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/mumen/">Mumen</a> and west of <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/lola/">Lola</a>.

<blockquote>
<p><em>These were pleasant, poor boroughs of the Capital lighted by all corners of the world.

</h2>
<p>Pharos was originally called Asmelola (lit. Southern Oslola) by its Algic inhabitants and for most of its history under the Middle and early Late Periods of Vekllei, but was renamed in the early 20th Century after the Pharos of Alexandria, an Egyptian lighthouse and ancient wonder, in an immodest declaration of the emerging Atlantic port&rsquo;s importance as a bridge between the Old World and the Americas. The name&rsquo;s origins as a candidate for the Asmelola area coincided by the ambitious plans to construct a deepwater port on the Coast of the Americas. The name was retained after the Vekllei defeat in the First Atomic War and into the Floral Period today.</p>
<h2 id="history">
  History

</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable. I mean, I almost can&rsquo;t believe it. It&rsquo;s something you read about as a child, but it&rsquo;s never something I&rsquo;d imagine I&rsquo;d get to see. And here I am, about to visit the moon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ndash; Tzipora</p>
<p>Pharos has a long history of settlement, twinned with <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/lola/">Lola</a> (then Oslola) as Vekllei&rsquo;s first urban area. It has evidence of settlement dating back 3,000 years. Algic peoples used the borough&rsquo;s sheltered coastline for hunting and fishing, and tools from 2,000 BC have been found in the present-day municipalities of <a href="#uclo">Uclo</a> and <a href="#pharos">Pharos</a>. The borough was first settled permanently by Irish settlers in 1200 BC, who exploited the rich soil of the area to feed the growing agricultural settlement in Oslola.</p>
<p>By 400 BC, Pharos (then Asmelola) was a meeting place between Norse and Algic peoples for trade and commerce, uniting the Algic settlements along the Southern and East coastlines with the principle Scandinavian settlement in Oslola. This would advantage the borough as a place of domestic commerce well into the Vekllei Common Period and beyond. An Iron mine was established in Asmelola in 400 AD, which attracted settlement from the Oslola city outskirts towards Asmelola, a trend which would position the town as an industrial power-base of the regimes in Lola. Although still primarily agricultural, Asmelola would slowly develop into a small city of craftsmen into the 8th Century and beyond.</p>
<p>Asmelola entered a long decline after the Desimou dynasty faltered in the 15th Century, shifting political power in Vekllei towards its East Coast. Its decline was halted by the overthrow of the monarchy in the 17th Century, which dragged power from the Coasts towards Lola, and restored Asmelola to prosperity, which rapidly developed the city away from its agricultural roots.</p>
<p>In the late 19th Century, it was apparent that the Port of Vekllei in Lola had become crowded and dangerous, evidenced by the Great Fire of 1841. The Atlantic Commonwealth under Jos Jehansson nominated Asmelola as a successor for a new port, which was established in 1856. Further expansion of the Port of Asmelola was undertaken in 1860 and 1872 to increase its warehousing and shipping capacity.</p>
<p>By the early 20th Century, the Port of Asmelola had also become overcrowded and under-equipped for emerging forms of cargo, and would soon be incapable of docking newer, larger ships from Europe and the Americas. In an effort to revitalise the ports of the Vekllei and drag the city-state out of its looming recession, the commonwealth government renamed Asmelola to Pharos and made plans to expand the Port of Pharos dramatically, dredging huge new shipping lanes to facilitate transatlantic trade. A recession in 1918 and another in 1923 effectively bankrupted the regime and halted further construction on the great port of Pharos, which remains a minor commercial port to this day.</p>
<p>Pharos suffered atomic strikes in the First Atomic War in 2005, leaving craters in both <a href="#sandeyri">Sandeyri</a> and <a href="#faro">Faro</a>.</p>
<p>After independence in 2015, Pharos was restructured as a borough and became one of Vekllei&rsquo;s most multicultural boroughs, and is the site of most migrant processing in the country.</p>

</h2>
<p>Pharos is low-lying and coastal, and today is home to many immigrant neighbourhoods that settled in the cheap real estate surrounding the industrial port area after the war. It is a deeply multicultural and international borough, and not just for its jetport and migrant residents. Once promised by the Atlantic Junta as a gateway to the world, Pharos has realised this vision in the post-war Floral period as a place of opportunity and culture.</p>

<p>Copetpek is a multicultural municipality best known for its craftsmanship and legendary Artisan&rsquo;s Quarter, home to multigenerational and historic woodworkers, writers, and metallurgists. Very little of Copetpek&rsquo;s business district is commercial, and generally does not produce goods for public consumption. Because of the municipality&rsquo;s depiction in Vekllei cinema, it is highly romanticised and on most days is full of sightseers hoping to meet these mysterious creatives or tour their workshops.</p>

<p>Faro is the so-called &lsquo;gateway to Vekllei,&rsquo; since it is the municipality where most Vekllei depart upon arrival to the country. It is also the site of post-war migrant processing and immigration via the Faro Immigrant Processing Complex, which has integrated millions of migrants since 2015. Today, the neighbourhood is home to a dense network of row-houses and coffee shops, most of which house migrant workers and new immigrants. Faro is also the site of the School of Vekllei, a language school constructed to ease foreigners into the complex <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language">Vekllei language</a> and introduce postwar cultural behaviours and moneyless living.</p>

<p>Keflavic is an ancient municipality in Pharos. It was originally a trading post between Norse and Algic settlement in the 4th Century BC, and remains today a neighbourhood of great history. Keflavic&rsquo;s oldest building, the Kesndosn Turf House in the south of the town, is among Vekllei&rsquo;s oldest standing structures and is believed to be over 1,000 years old. Keflavic is also home to the Keflavic Whalers, one of the greatest cricket teams in Vekllei and who won the Cricket World Cup in 2036.</p>

</h3>
<p>Petty Shanghai (the colloquial name for West Keflavic) is a municipality home to Vekllei&rsquo;s largest ethnic Chinese population, composed primarily of immigrants from Hong Kong and the People&rsquo;s Republic of China. Located adjacent to immigrant processing facilities in <a href="#faro">Faro</a>, the density of Chinese inhabitants is largely due to the appropriation of war-damaged housing by the Vekllei Housing Commission for new migrants. Contemporary policy now aims to immerse migrant communities, and so enclaves like Petty Shanghai are less common today.</p>
<p>Petty Shanghai is well-known in Vekllei as a sort of &lsquo;Chinatown,&rsquo; both for its exquisite local cuisine and the intense foreignness of its culture and lifestyle. Many early Chinese migrants were poorly integrated by the failing government language programmes in the early postwar years, so many older residents speak mainly Cantonese or Mandarin.</p>
<p>Petty Shanghai is centred around a public area called Shanghai Neu, or Keflavic Commons. Much of its neighbourhood architecture is dilapidated and pre-war, and the redevelopment of the area is key to an ongoing fight between residents and the Pharos Borough government.</p>

<p>These include projects like <a href="#uclo-experimental-social-housing-project">the Towers</a>, as well as pre-war municipalised housing designed to home Vekllei&rsquo;s growing migrant population. Because of this history, neighbourhoods within Uclo are quite distinct from each other.

The uniting feature of Uclo, then, is Green Woods beach and its cool, clear waters &ndash; a feature hard to imagine surviving the full scale of the Junta&rsquo;s &lsquo;Port of Vekllei&rsquo; ambitions, should they have succeeded in displacing the Port of Vekllei.</p>

It is these luxuries and conveniences that keep the Towers desirable even 40 years on. Although successful in their goal to prove a new form of plentiful, comfortable housing, social housing policy shifted in the years after their construction, and Vekllei rarely builds apartment towers today.</p>

<p><strong>Santes</strong> is the Vekllei word for &ldquo;saint,&rdquo; and dates back to the Christianisation of Vekllei&rsquo;s Middle Period sometime prior to the 16th Century. Its earliest appearance was traced to the Santesoavis chapel (lit. All Saints) near the city of Santes, built sometime in the 15th Century by Danish settlers, to which the parish and eventual borough owes its name. Outside of Christian contexts, Santes in Vekllei can also refer to noble spirits, the communicative spirits of <a href="/factbook/society/culture/religion/"><em>Upen</em></a>.</p>

  History

</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you know what happens when God meets a spirit? Do you have any idea? It is a place of blessings. It&rsquo;s huge! We <em>have</em> to find this shrine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ndash; <a href="/factbook/characters/#tzipora-zelda-desmoisnes">Tzipora Desmoisnes</a>, convinced of hidden shrines in Santes</p>
<p>Vekllei&rsquo;s northern coast was settled predominantly by Scandinavian settlers, who were displaced from Vekllei&rsquo;s south in the centuries prior to the 15th Century. For this reason, the cultural and religious segregation of the north coasts produced unusual settlements unique from both southern Vekllei culture and Scandinavia. Settlements in present-day Santes and Moma were heavily christianised, but upon Upen&rsquo;s reformation by King Desimou IV these populations were forcefully integrated into Vekllei&rsquo;s feudal hierarchy and were ethnically displaced by Algic Vekllei.</p>
<p>Despite this, Santes would remain culturally isolated from Vekllei&rsquo;s powerful southern metropole, and remained somewhat politically independent until the late Junta years. By the early 19th Century, a road was established between Montre and the city of Santes, followed by a direct rail line in 1922. By this time, the Junta had consolidated control over all settlements in the Home Islands, and Santes was subsidised heavily by political centres in Montre and Vekllei Proper.</p>
<h3 id="postwar-development">
  Postwar Development
  <a class="anchor" href="#postwar-development">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Immediately after the war, Santes succumbed to a minor famine that killed nearly a tenth of its population. The borough was largely neglected until independence from British occupation in 2015, when the Interim Administration took control of the Home Islands. It was linked to the VNR Coastal Bullet Train Network in 2044.</p>
<p>Santes&rsquo;s historical isolation from Vekllei&rsquo;s coastal regions has left many of its fjords undeveloped, which have become minor tourist attractions. Today, the borough is best known for its natural features, and as the origin of <em>Fisk Ferva</em>, or Vekllei&rsquo;s modern raw fish cuisine.</p>
<h2 id="geography">
  Geography
  <a class="anchor" href="#geography">#</a>
</h2>
<p>As a northern coastal borough, Santes sees wet summers and cold winters. Icebergs routinely wash ashore along its coast throughout the year, pulled south from the arctic by the Vekllei Gulf Stream. The borough itself is marked by cliffs and steep fjords, and most of its large settlements are some 100-200 meters above sea level. It is extremely lush, and features some of Vekllei&rsquo;s most visible and saturated coastal temperate rainforest.</p>
<h3 id="coastal-fjords">
  Coastal Fjords
  <a class="anchor" href="#coastal-fjords">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Santes&rsquo;s glacial fjords appear as dramatic fingers of igneous rock, puncturing its coast with thousands of deep-water inlets. Since the borough is still dominated by aquaculture and minor agriculture, small villages are often found at the base of these inlets. This dramatic landscape and coastal treelessness is described in old Upen sagas, which contribute to the borough&rsquo;s interest among pilgrims.</p>
<h3 id="inlet-biosecurity-zone">
  Inlet Biosecurity Zone
  <a class="anchor" href="#inlet-biosecurity-zone">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Most inlets in Santes are protected by the Inlet Biosecurity Zone of Santes, a national legal protection that seeks to maintain the populations of open-water fish that live in them. Under these laws, only residents of Santes are permitted to fish among its fjords.</p>
<h3 id="santes-rainforest">
  Santes Rainforest
  <a class="anchor" href="#santes-rainforest">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Santes has several crown land rainforested regions, which prohibit sovereign visitation. Since the harsh weather of the coasts has depopulated most of the fjords of trees, these rainforests are mostly found around the city of Santes and further into its interior. The largest of them is the Mus Mus Crown Land, which includes nearly six thousand acres of rainforest.</p>
<h2 id="infrastructure">
  Infrastructure
  <a class="anchor" href="#infrastructure">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Santes is considered a minor borough and is not home to much venrouive/bureau proper activity. Most factories are consolidated in the city of Santes, which mostly produce fish products and metal components.</p>
<h3 id="santes-magma-electric-power-plant">
  Santes Magma-Electric Power Plant
  <a class="anchor" href="#santes-magma-electric-power-plant">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The Santes Magma-Electric Power Plant is a facility operated by the Magma-Electric Commission of the Thunderburo. Its massive steam bores supply most of the power to Santes and Moma, and the waste water of this process is pumped into the Santes Mineral Lagoons, an open-air mineral spa open to the public.</p>

  Overview
  <a class="anchor" href="#overview">#</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Vekllei</strong> is best conceptualised as a union of islands across the Atlantic Ocean. It is a commonwealth,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> the fourth in a series, and consists of many island republics that are connected by politics and prosperity, not geography or race. These islands range in size from the Selvas Islands of 160 people to the island of Oslola, of 8 million. Together, they amount to a single superstate that spans the entirety of the Atlantic as a great power.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth which unites them is highly centralised and built on common systems of governance and economic management. Member republics, known as <a href="/constituents/">Constituents</a> cede aspects of governance like security, health and education to the Commonwealth. The country is colloquially known as <em>Vekllei</em>, an Algic <a href="/corcidi/">corcidi</a> word meaning <em>people of the sea and stars</em>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> It is also known as the <em>Commonwealth of Oceans</em>.</p>
<p>The capital of Vekllei is <a href="/comet/">Comet</a>, located west of the Azores Commonwealth in the Meteor Islands.</p>
<p>Vekllei is often regarded a nation by will, rather than of culture or geography. It consists of distant autonomous republics with many cultures and languages, and it has attracted millions of immigrants since independence looking to participate in building the unique aspects of its governance and society.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oslola, raging and now blinded, drew deep wounds into the Earth. Out of these wounds came fire, and out of fire came her child Oslola.</p>

  <summary>What is Vekllei?</summary>
  <div class="markdown-inner">
    Vekllei is a country that consists of many island republics in the Atlantic. The largest of these is called the <em>Oslola</em>, which is its most populous island. Vekllei is the setting of this fiction, and is the home of most of its characters.
  </div>
</details>

<details >
  <summary>Where is Vekllei?</summary>
  <div class="markdown-inner">
    Most of Vekllei&rsquo;s islands are found in the North Atlantic and Caribbean seas. Its northernmost territory is Helvasia (Svalbard) and its southernmost territories are on the Antarctic continent. It also has a claim on the moon.
  </div>
</details>

<details >
  <summary>When was Vekllei founded?</summary>
  <div class="markdown-inner">
    The Commonwealth of Oceans (Vekllei) was founded in 2017 after independence in 2015, and is the 4th in a succession of historic Commonwealths based in the Kalan and Oslolan Islands. The first, known as the Nord Commonwealth, was the world&rsquo;s first parliament and among the first democracies in the world.

  <div class="text">The diversity of the Commonwealth is reflected in its history. Vekllei as we know it today may have roots in in the Oslola-Kalan Union and Kalina nationalism, but its story begins in 1995, during the First Atomic War and British Occupation of its former colonial territories for 20 years. That occupation, and the complete restructuring of Atlantic society beneath it, lay the foundations for a new and pluralistic union of republics called Vekllei.</div>

<p>Many Commonwealth republics have been inhabited for thousands of years, and have strong cultures and traditions that encompass many unique languages and faiths. The Kalina Isles and Oslola have archaeological evidence indicating settlement since at least 3000BC, and much of Oslolan and Kalan history has been recorded through poetry and <a href="/sagas/">Sagas</a>.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth of Oceans has precedence in the Oslolan Commonwealths that existed sporadically between 700 AD and 1600 AD. For this reason, the Vekllei Commonwealth is sometimes referred to as the &ldquo;4th Commonwealth,&rdquo; a phrase that draws a direct connection between Vekllei and the Oslolan Commonwealths.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Common history of the republics begins in 1710 AD, when Oslola and Kala capitulated to the Kingdom of Great Britain and became subjects the British Empire. In 1836, the British colonies in the Atlantic were reincorporated as the British Atlantic Territories. This colony was granted autonomy in 1838 and achieved dominion status in 1926, and lay the groundwork for Oslolan independence in 1935.</p>
<p>After the Second World War, the Oslolan Republic struggled through a series of crises that culminated in the fall of government and the establishment of the Atlantic Council in 1963, which severed ties with the UK. Rising territorial ambitions and erratic council rule saw relations strained and culminated in the Oslolan Civil War in 1992 and the exchange of nuclear weapons with the UK in 1995.</p>
<p>Oslolan territories, including Kala and Demon, were occupied between 1995 and 2017. Independence was granted in 2015, in which occupied territories ceded local rule to a union called the Vekllei Commonwealth. This Commonwealth is the foundation of modern Vekllei.</p>
<p>Other member-states,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> including Kalina and former Atlantic Portuguese territories, joined beteen 2020 and 2040.</p>

  <div class="text">Vekllei contains a lot of ideas colliding with each other, which break into fragments and fuse to create new elements. This is a result of its similarly chaotic history, uniting a patchwork of republics that have been subjugated by other powers over time. These elements have evolved to become a new kind of nation-state, unique in the world and history.</div>
</blockquote>

<p>The Commonwealth is foremostly a union of Atlantic and Caribbean islands which, freed from colonial rule, have established a federal system to share common burdens and improve the lives of their oceangoing peoples.</p>
<p>Vekllei is a constitutional, federated country including <a href="/constituents/">six individual commonwealths</a> which share political features established by the <a href="/rose-council/">Council of Roses</a>.</p>
<p>It has a unique kind of federalism, with republics and territories orbiting central Commonwealth control at different distances. A common means of petitioning membership, or &ldquo;acceding&rdquo; to the Commonwealth is via its international organisation called the <a href="/oceans-council/">Council of Oceans</a>.</p>
<p>Although regionally and culturally diverse, Commonwealth government is centralised and the state functions as a single country. These republics have large degrees of autonomy, but are unilaterally governed by the central Commonwealth government as an intact state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vekllei&rdquo; is the phrase for the culture and ideology of the Commonwealth state, and is used interchangeably to refer to the country.</p>
<h3 id="territories">
  Territories
  <a class="anchor" href="#territories">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The Commonwealth spans the length and width of the Atlantic and Caribbean oceans. Its northernmost island in the Commonwealth is Helvasia (<em>Svalbard</em>) in the Arctic Ocean, and its southernmost island is Southern Thule, in the Sude island chain (<em>South Sandwich</em>). The Commonwealth also has Antarctic and Lunar territories. They are united by a strong central government, and administered in a cascading federal system.</p>
<p>These islands are diverse in both size and geography, and range from barren subarctic rocks to flourishing Caribbean archipelagoes,</p>
<p>A major motivator of membership in the Commonwealth is its trade influence and wealth, since <a href="/constituents/">constituents</a> and <a href="/territories/">territories</a> are entitled to the same standards of living as its major industrial territories. The most recent member is Cabo Verde, acceding in 2038 after two decades of membership in the <a href="/oceans-council/">Council of Oceans</a>.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth has explored petitions for membership from non-island countries including Suriname, though these have been unsuccessful.</p>

<p>The Commonwealth has a hybrid moneyless system called <em>commons</em>, in which money is not used in daily life. In the place of money, the commons system exists as a series of social economies and usufructs. Rather than purchasing products as consumers, staples like food and clothing are subsidised by groups of companies known as <a href="/bureaus/"><em>bureaus</em></a>. Everything else is produced in the colloquial moneyless market, often unreliably.</p>
<p>Money is used in a seperate industrial and financial market called the <em>financialised commons</em>. In this market, Vekllei has two currencies known as <a href="/factbook/society/state/finance/#vekllei-crown-vk"><em>Vekllei</em></a> and <a href="/factbook/society/state/finance/#government-crown-ak"><em>Government Crowns</em></a>, which used by the government, industry and foreigners to interact with the Vekllei economy and purchase securities and financial instruments. Money is also used as a means of exchange between Commonwealth republics as a privilege of the state.</p>
<p>The country has maintained high unemployment since independence, sliding between 5-10% for most of the postwar period.</p>
<p>The commons economy relies on a system of participatory work, encouraged by the simple and universal rule to be employed, called <a href="/consosva/">Consosva</a>. The standard of living in Vekllei is quite good and is unique among modern societies today.</p>
<p>In industrialised regions like Oslola, the <em>commons</em> has a sophisticated network of incentives and social engineering to facilitate its quality of life. In other regions, particularly scattered across the many archipelagos and small islands of the Commonwealth, self-sufficiency is more common and dependent on fishing, community and codependence.</p>

<p>Employment in Vekllei has many unique features, not least of which is its functional moneylessness. Except for Verde,<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> no republic of the Commonwealth uses money in daily life. Work in Vekllei is characterised by lifetime employment and seniority-based advancement, though this culture is changing in some industries. Most larger businesses in Vekllei function as cooperatives, often as part of a <a href="/bureaus/">Bureau</a>.</p>

<p>This work environment ranks highly for competitiveness but lowly for economic freedom, as the structure of the commons inhibits scaling businesses beyond social dimensions. Private business ownership is most common in small communities with strong social bonds, particularly in rural or agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Vekllei people generally have aspirations of power rather than wealth, and work towards that goal in the absence of a wage. Other reasons for work include its strong social dimensions and relaxed ethic, which are facilitated by a professional but gentle work culture that retains short working days and frequent tea breaks.</p>

<p>Vekllei separates its markets to allow for money to be used by industry and the government as part of trade and business.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Commons</strong> is the moneyless and participatory domestic market.</li>
<li><strong>The Financialised Commons</strong> are the moneyed industrial and international markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most Vekllei people never interact with the financialised commons, but it plays a significant role in the economy. Vekllei&rsquo;s history as a series of entrepôts and its international neutrality have made it desirable as a place of business and investment, and many foreign companies bank in Vekllei. Vekllei is a major commodities and securities exchange, via the <a href="/factbook/society/state/finance/#international-markets">Vekllei International Market</a>.</p>
<p>Despite its international investment and low barriers to trade, the Commonwealth government is a major participant in the financialised commons and contributes significantly to its currency pool. Vekllei has the second-largest foreign currency reserves in the world.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth has major financial hubs in Bermuda, the Bahamas and the Azores.</p>

<p>Parts of Vekllei are highly industrialised,<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> and the country has modernised its economy since independence through labour-saving automations, centralisation and new technologies like <a href="/computers/">robotics</a>.

<p>Major industries in Vekllei leverage the creative productivity of its enthusiastic and well-educated population, and leads markets in financial services, design, banking, electronics, telecommunications and research.

<p>The right to property is protected by the <a href="/constitution/">Vekllei Constitution</a>, and important in North Vekllei culture. Home ownership is a foundation of <a href="/municipalities/">Atlantic Municipalism</a>, and is determined by stewardship of land.</p>
<p>In the Vekllei legal system, land has three competing agents:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Steward &ndash; the occupier and worker of the land</li>
<li>The Public &ndash; the community, municipality and state</li>
<li>The Sovereign &ndash; the land itself, as a seperate sovereign kingdom of nature</li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than defined legal owners, land ownership in Vekllei is a pluralistic competition between these three agents. The claim to ownership grows with time and use, and so it is possible for any agent to litigate property provided a reasonable claim to ownership can be provided.</p>
<p>In North Vekllei, where <a href="/upen/">Upen</a> folk metaphysics are practiced, the Sovereign is treated literally as a competing agent. In other parts of Vekllei, like the Kalina Isles, it is treated as nature itself or the environment. In both cases, the interests of the Sovereign are established by special prosecutors in court.</p>
<p>Nearly 96% of Vekllei people own their homes, among the highest rates of home-ownership in the world.</p>

<p>Vekllei has championed the nonalignment movement since independence. Situated between NATO powers (North America and Western Europe) and between exploited developing regions (South America and West Africa), the Commonwealth uses nonalignment simultaneously as an instrument of peace and intervention. It has close relations with other nonaligned countries, including Yugoslavia and India.</p>
<p>This historical neutrality and geographic accessibility has encouraged the founding and relocation of international organisations to Vekllei. Vekllei chairs the <a href="/oceans-council/">Council of Oceans</a> and has many international organisations headquartered across its republics, including the International Federation of Journalists and the new United Nations Office.</p>
<p>Many Vekllei people work overseas for a period of time, either individually or as part of Commonwealth-sponsored programmes. The country is among the largest exporters of doctors and teachers in the world, many of whom work in West and Southern Africa.</p>

<p>Commonwealth society is internationalist owing to its internal distance and diversity, and so aspects of its political and cultural beliefs are considered universal. Atlantic Laicity overrules religious practice where it violates Commonwealth values or law &ndash; for example the wearing of long veils in schools and public institutions is prohibited. Similarly, the Commonwealth considers democracy to be a foundational human right and belief in it is essential for participation in society.</p>
<p>Because the unmoneyed <em>Commons</em> economy is essentially unregulated beyond the <a href="/basic-laws/">Vekllei Basic Laws</a>, Commonwealth society has strong anarchist currents.</p>

<p><strong>The West Antilles</strong> (commonly <em><strong>The Leeward Isles</strong></em>) is the common name of three autonomous islands that make up the West Antilles, situated offshore of northern Venezuela in the Caribbean Sea. Like the <a href="/factbook/landscape/territories/west">Kalina Isles</a></p>
<p>The Kalina Islands have been inhabited for thousands of years by Carib peoples called the <em>Kalinago</em>, who make up the majority of Kalina&rsquo;s 350,000 people today. Traditionally seafaring and seminomadic, Kalina and its neighbours in the Lesser Antilles were devastated by the arrival of Europeans in the 16th Century. Kalina was originally colonised by almost all colonising nations of the European colonial period, but were eventually united under Spanish rule in 1638 as part of the Treaty of Barbuda and the end of the Franco-Spanish War.</p>
<p>Kalina was purchased from the Spanish by the Vekllei city-state in the late 17th Century, and indicated Vekllei’s initial intention to exploit the New World. This ambition was scuppered with the collapse of the Vekllei monarchy, which established forts across Kalina&rsquo;s islands but could not muster the resources to occupy continental America. Vekllei’s colonial efforts were blunted for centuries after, and excluded the country from major participation in the slave trade and the colonisation of Africa.</p>
<p>Vekllei was forcibly decolonised during British occupation between 2005 and 2015, and Kalina during this period was reorganised as a British territory. After independence in 2015, the Vekllei Home Islands renegotiated Kalina&rsquo;s independence as a member of the Vekllei Commonwealth (alongside other former colonial posessions), which was established in 2017.</p>
<p>Today, the Kalina Islands are the most populous member of the Vekllei Commonwealth, and has thrived in the Floral Period as an new country under its own government.</p>

alina shares the Vekllei city-state&rsquo;s unusual parliamentary system and geographic electoral districts. The country is independent, but like other full members of Commonwealth it shares much of its constitutional legislature and state structure with the Vekllei city-state. The Armed Forces of the Commonwealth of Vekllei are responsible for defence of Kalina, which is positioned strategically in the Caribbean and hosts several important military facilities throughout its island chains.</p>

  The Vekllei Commonwealth
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-vekllei-commonwealth">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The Commonwealth of Vekllei is a multinational ideological, political, defence and trading bloc that includes the Vekllei City State, Kala, Aismious, Demon, Azores, Mira, and Kalina. It includes territories of the Vekllei city-state (Kala, Aismious, Demon) and independent countries (Azores, Mira, Kalina) that are closely aligned with postwar Floral constitutional principls and Bureau economics. In this sense, most of the commonwealth closely resemble Vekllei&rsquo;s society.</p>
<p>Vekllei uses a Hare-Clark single transferable vote system to elect two prime ministers, one man and one woman, the only such system in the world. Vekllei has a bicameral legislature, consisting of an upper house (the <em>Crown Senate</em>) of 100 senators and a lower house (<em>People&rsquo;s Assembly</em>) of 200 members. Although voting is participatory and the country does not maintain a poll tax, electoral enrolment is mandatory from age 16 onwards.</p>
<p>Since Vekllei is nonpartisan, it does not allow formal participation of parties within elections. Despite this, informal associations of elected representatives exist, in the form of <em>sociopartit</em>, or <em>Party Associations</em>. The largest of these include the Vekllei Industrial Working Concern, the Atlantic Party, and the Crown Brotherhood, and although membership is permitted among elected members they are otherwise disallowed within the electoral process.</p>

  <div class="text"><strong>Vekllei</strong> is land of plenty and small pleasures, afforded by a post-scarcity system that positions competing systems against each other. It is made up of a startling series of contradictions &ndash; one after the other, each more unusual than the last. Vekllei is a planned economy; it is also a free market. Property ownership is obfuscated by portioned sovereignty of land and product. Decommodification has devalued products in a country based on manufacturing. There are many contradictions, inefficiencies and unusual mechanisms in the Vekllei domestic market, which total to benefit the living conditions of the average person.</div>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="fc">A</span>
<strong>lthough</strong> a major power, Vekllei has an unusual hybrid market system called the <em>Vekllei Bureau System</em> (known colloquially as <em>Petticoat Socialism</em>), which incorporates state-owned socialist planned economics and deregulated syndicalist vertical <em>bureaus</em> to benefit a free, unregulated informal market system. Most unique about the Vekllei economy is its functional moneylessness, in which domestic society has abolished currency. No widespread currency substitutes are used in ordinary life. Each citizen owns a share of the <em>Labour Bank of Vekllei</em>, a portion of the <em>Government Securities Bureau</em> designed to allow emigration from the country, and so is theoretically entitled to an equal portion of the Bank.</p>

</p>
<p>Trade and materials are provided by biosynthetic robotics infrastructure and participatory work, and is supplemented in places by mandatory military service. Vekllei people enjoy a high standard of living and access to most consumer goods.</p>
<p>Postwar Vekllei economics champions free association, home-ownership and informal markets. Although microeconomically Vekllei is highly liberalised, most essential goods of the country are produced in vertically integrated in labour-union <em>Bureaus</em>, which, although representative of private companies and independent from the government, are associated with the general political processes of the country.</p>
<p><em>Bureaus</em> (also <em>Bureaus Proper</em>, as distinguished from informal <em>Petty Bureaus</em>) are trade unions that organise business in the country, and the largest of them include thousands of individual companies and concerns. Companies are generally cooperative enterprises in Vekllei, and so worker votes are consolidated into &ldquo;Company Ballots&rdquo; used to influence political affairs within a <em>Bureau</em> and the country at large.</p>
<p>Although moneyless domestically, the nation maintains two currencies, known as the <em>Vekllei Crown</em> and the <em>Government Crown</em> for foreign trade.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Vekllei Crown</strong> is representative of Vekllei&rsquo;s export-import mechanism known as the <em>International Market</em>. It is gold-backed, and represents the bullion value of the Market. Since the <em>International Market</em> is completely closed and independent of the domestic economy, its value is controlled directly by the so-called Government Bank. It is one of the few gold-backed currencies in a developed nation today.</li>
<li><strong>The Government Crown</strong> is not minted and used only as an investment mechanism, backed by government “white bonds” which are usually measures of labour-hours or refined materials. It is, in a sense, a fiat currency alongside a gold-backed currency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both currencies are used for trade internationally, and float on the labour-power of the domestic economy. The Vekllei Crown is minted as a novelty, but otherwise no money is printed in the country, since Government Crowns are essentially labour-backed state bonds. Moneylessness benefits citizens in many ways, as Vekllei people do not typically maintain debts, have access to unlimited small commodities, and enjoy some of the shortest workdays and working weeks in the world, with all citizens afforded two months holiday each year.</p>
<h3 id="employment">
  Employment
  <a class="anchor" href="#employment">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Vekllei has a high unemployment rate for a developed country, reported at 12.5%. About 80% of Vekllei workers belong to a trade union, usually <em>Pettiburos</em> or <em>Bureaus</em>. Nearly 2 million Vekllei people are enrolled in higher education full-time, significantly reducing the nation&rsquo;s labour pool. These are accounted for politically as natural fluctuations of the deregulated Bureau System, and unemployment in the country has seen a stable reduction since the initial decades of independence. Although many citizens in Vekllei are immigrants, the country has few foreign workers, and those employed in the country tend to be high-skill and high-wage workers.</p>
<p>Since no work is compensated by money in the country, international standard metrics for poverty and income per capita are obfuscated. It is generally understood that urban populations have easier access to consumer goods, but inferior access to local produce and genuine meat products. Rural populations are also more likely to take on informal work in their village or town, and may not necessarily hold membership in an industry bureau.</p>
<h3 id="industry">
  Industry
  <a class="anchor" href="#industry">#</a>
</h3>
<p>All commercial enterprise in Vekllei is founded along two legal and cultural classifications:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Venrouive</strong></em> is business managed by a <em>Bureau Proper</em>, an organ consisting of trade unions in an industry. While <em>Bureaus</em> are independent from government, they are for the most part bound to their concern, and so in practice <em>Venrouive</em> businesses are beholden to the democratic processes of the country.</li>
<li><em><strong>Senrouive</strong></em> is business not managed by a <em>Bureau Proper</em>, though it may still hold membership in a <em>Petty Bureau</em>. It is analogous to private enterprise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vekllei&rsquo;s sovereign wealth fund, the Government Securities Bureau, is the largest such fund in the world with commodity and non-commodity holdings totalling over VK❦45 trillion. It is the primary investment mechanism of the Vekllei state and has generated controversy around its substantial economic power and commodity holdings abroad. Vekllei is the second-largest logistics hub in the world, and as a maritime city-state sees millions of tonnes worth of shipping traffic each year pass through its ports.</p>
<p>Vekllei&rsquo;s Dohyo Free Port is the largest in the Atlantic and among the busiest in the world. Most of Vekllei&rsquo;s liquid currency assets, denominated as Government Kroner, are generated through a shipping Goods and Services Tax (GST) on all foreign business in the country of approx. 10%, of which the Dohyo Free Port contributes VK❦12 trillion each year.</p>
<p>Vekllei primarily exports manufactured goods, which are produced by both human and automatic labour via commodity imports and extraterrestrial materials mining as part of the Solar Concern of the Vekllei Commonwealth Materials Bureau (or Solaburo).</p>
<p>Most personal or private business in Vekllei is structured as either single-person shops (<strong>S.p.A.</strong>, or <em>senrouiva pettetie anaproiouya</em>), co-operative businesses (<strong>S.q.A.</strong>, or <em>senrouiva qualitie anaproiouya</em>), or village factories (<strong>S.p.M.</strong>, or <em>senrouiva persimonaya manufacturie</em>). Any commercial enterprise larger than S.p.M. tends to hold membership in or is directly administered by a <em>Bureau Proper</em>, though there are exceptions.</p>
<h3 id="tourism">
  Tourism
  <a class="anchor" href="#tourism">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Tourism is a major source of foreign income in Vekllei, and the country attracts some 6 million tourists annually. Although the number of tourists is low compared to popular destinations in North America and Europe, Vekllei&rsquo;s strict entry requirements and state monopoly on hotels and tourist infrastructure means that most visitors are high-wealth business travellers or affluent foreigners, which together contribute around 0.5% of the country&rsquo;s GDP annually.</p>
<p>Vekllei sponsors tourism abroad via the Social Government Bank, which allows Vekllei people to withdraw superannuated cash savings for tourism and travel abroad.</p>

<strong>ekllei</strong> has one of the highest population densities in the world, skewed largely by the populous Capital Region. Vekllei considers itself a city-state, and to this end fosters &ldquo;commonhoods&rdquo;, represented by <em>common practice</em>, <em>common work</em> and <em>common landscape</em>. Although Vekllei has been settled for thousands of years, postwar advocation of <em>commonhoods</em> emphasises <em>landscape</em> in place of the historic <em>blood</em> in wake of Vekllei&rsquo;s growing migrant population and multiculturalism. Nearly 30% of Vekllei people were born overseas, though this number is trending down as immigration quotas (set by emigration) restrict inflow in recent decades.</p>
<p>Vekllei is experiencing a slight demographic trend towards an older population, and the average age of the country stands at 35 years old.</p>
<p>Vekllei maintains a stable fertility rate of about 1.8 children per woman, indicating a slight decline in population. Vekllei enjoys high rates of immigration, sponsored by the government, and sees settlement from Western and Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, South-East Asia and South America. Vekllei has also experienced high rates of emigration since independence, although many expats retain citizenship and later return to residence in Vekllei at some point. To this end, Vekllei is one of the largest exporters of skilled workers and tradesmen in the world.</p>

<p>Modern Vekllei language (referred to simply as <em><strong>Vekllei</strong></em>) is the national language of the country and spoken universally within the Home Islands and Vekllei&rsquo;s various Atlantic possessions. It is notable for its varied sublanguages, which include a signed language called <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language/#6-upotenne"><em>Upotenne</em></a> and various extant utility scripts.</p>
<p>Vekllei is spoken by around 25 million people, and a further 800,000 people around the world. Its relative complexity and provinciality lend to Vekllei&rsquo;s cultural obscurity abroad, since few Vekllei people are English literate.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><em>Upen</em> is the nondenominational animism of Vekllei, and is practiced nearly universally throughout the country in various forms and traditions. As much a secular cultural tradition as an organised religion, <em>Upen</em> coexists alongside abrahamic and miscellaneous faiths in the country, integrating most immigrant populations in Vekllei into its scripture on landscape and <em>sumoismiaya</em>, or the &ldquo;spirit of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Vekllei has no state religion, <em>Upen</em> is thoroughly integrated with Vekllei culture and policy, and informs life and practice in this country as an agonistic feature of culture. Vekllei&rsquo;s Floral Constitution prohibits governmental regulation of religion or prohibition of faith. Despite this, <em>Upen</em> is taught in state schools and practiced frequently, reinforcing its relevance across younger generations in a broader resurgence of traditional folklore in the postwar era.</p>
<p>Although most people in the country observe <em>Upen</em> apolitically, several other religious cultures hold sway in the country, including Catholicism (11%) Judaism (9%), Buddhism (4%), Islam (2%), Hinduism (1.3%) and Sikhism (0.7%). Despite this, Vekllei has some of the lowest rates of religious adherence in the world, estimated at a mere 6%, signifying <em>Upen</em>&rsquo;s cultural influence on personal practice and informal ritual.</p>
<h3 id="education">

<p>Education in Vekllei is structured as a <em>State Requisite Bureau</em> (rather than department) under the <em>requoisesiasn amourisocietie scolastie</em>, or A.r.E. Schooling is mandatory and universal between the ages of 5 and 14, and most schools in the country serve all ages between these years. All schools in Vekllei, aside from a half-dozen religious schools, are coeducational and operated directly by the A.r.E.</p>
<p>All institutions of higher learning, including universities, trade schools and adult education, are structured under the A.r.E.. <a href="/posts/2020-09-08-uniforms/">School uniforms</a> informed by <a href="/posts/2020-01-11-dress/">traditional dress</a> are provided and worn from preschool through to university, and faculty staff also often wear them.</p>

<p><span class="fc">U</span>
<strong>nlike</strong> manufacturing and general industry, public infrastructure in the country is almost entirely monopolised by the government Utilities (A.r.Un.) and Construction (A.r.Lo.) state requisites, organs in Vekllei analogous to nationalised government industry. Infrastructure consistently ranks among Vekllei&rsquo;s greatest national expenditure, with trillions of Kroner each year poured into projects across the country.</p>
<p>Most large infrastructure projects, including transport, education, health, military and extraterrestrial interests, are completed in cyclical phases similar to Soviet half-decade plans, including production quotas and hard deadlines for completion. This system of construction has allowed the country to recover quickly from its devastation in the Atomic War and develop one of the most comprehensive public infrastructure systems in the world. Vekllei is a major transport hub for international flights and Atlantic ocean crossings, served largely by the <strong>Vekllei International Jetport</strong> and the historic <strong>Port of Vekllei</strong> respectively.</p>
<h3 id="transport">
  Transport
  <a class="anchor" href="#transport">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Most Vekllei people do not own private autos, though they are available. Only 6% of the population possesses a driver license, and so most Vekllei people are dependent on the free and comprehensive network of transit systems that link settlement in the island, including trains of various guages, maglevs, trams, trolley busses, ferries, canal steamers, helijets, jets and light aircraft.</p>
<p>Vekllei has one of the highest density rail networks in the world, with some 14,000 kilometres of rail of various gauges. Trains vary from maglev hypertrains that connect Vekllei&rsquo;s Five Crown Cities to steam locomotives still in use for cultural reasons in the Home Island&rsquo;s rural interior. Vekllei&rsquo;s smallest rail gauge used in commercial service spans fifteen inches, and is commonly found in mountainous local service. Vekllei simultaneously has the oldest passenger locomotives in regular service in the world alongside some of the newest, including regular overhauls and innovations in maglev and bullet train types.</p>
<p>The Vekllei coast is ringed by various rail types, including the Coastal Bullet Train Network and a series of fast trams. A coastal highway, known as Motorway One, links Vekllei&rsquo;s single continuous neighbourhood by road. Motorways are not generally speed limited in Vekllei.</p>
<p>For most Vekllei people, automobiles are accessed via <em>autopools</em>, shared vehicle depots that operate like rental cars for trips not easily made via public transit. Licenses are required to drive, though this is rarely enforced and few drivers renew their licenses, especially outside of Vekllei&rsquo;s urban centres.</p>
<p>Vekllei has <a href="/posts/2019-11-19-stewards/">five state air carriers</a>, which constitute a government monopoly on all air travel in the country. The international flag carrier is <strong>Vekllei Overseas Airways</strong>, which serves air routes internationally with a fleet of various aircraft, including nuclear monowings and supersonic jets.</p>
<h3 id="housing">
  Housing
  <a class="anchor" href="#housing">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Vekllei&rsquo;s borough municipalities maintain a monopoly on real estate purchase in the country, although the national government and high court retain the right of compulsory acquisition. Most neighbourhoods are planned by municipal architects, leading some to call Vekllei an &lsquo;architocracy&rsquo;. Homes in planned neighbourhoods are often awarded via a lottery system in places of high demand, or are otherwise floated freely on the market. It is common for housing to be dependent on employment, especially in the Capital Region, and real estate often forms part of <em>viede compaszion</em>, or &rsquo;life compensation,&rsquo; which is how most business in Vekllei rewards labour.</p>
<p>Land ownership is common and usually proven by stewardship. Place-metaphysics in <em>Upen</em> also portion ownership between multiple agents simultaneously; the municipality, the land itself, architecture and the homeowner may all share ownership over land, awarded by common interest, community and utility. Although this muddies a traditional understanding of property, all homes in Vekllei are <em>de facto</em> owned by their residents, except in certain professions.</p>
<p>Homes are also commonly inherited in Vekllei. All Vekllei people are guaranteed a right to home and property under the Petticoat Constitution. Some 92% of adults own their residence in Vekllei.</p>

Vekllei operates sixteen nuclear power plants, but most nuclear energy is sold to Europe via undersea cables. All domestic electricity is supplied by Geothermal power plants and Hydroelectric dams for political and religious reasons, making Vekllei one of the only countries of its size to rely exclusively on renewable energy supply for residential and commercial services.</p>

<p><strong>The borough of Yana</strong> is an administrative region in central Vekllei, located in the far-western Lava region north of Tiyousn and east of Laisiyo. It is named after Yana, a city of some 45,000 people isolated along Vekllei&rsquo;s sparse, moonlike volcanic interior for which the Lava region is named. Yana makes up part of an agro-belt of depopulated boroughs that sit along the Sesmiousvianneh river, which washes rich igneous minerals north to towns downstream. The town of Yana is best known for its proximity to the spectacular molten lava fields common in the area.</p>

<p><strong>Yana</strong> was the name of Vekllei&rsquo;s first spirit ambassador in <a href="/factbook/society/culture/religion/">Upen</a> mythology, who met human farmer Armond Volusksson at the base of <em>Mose</em>, a volcano associated with lava spirits. Although the meeting (as described in the <em>Molten Wind</em> sagas) took place in the present-day borough of Askayaisn, it remains a common Blood Name in the country and was chosen for Yana&rsquo;s settlement to protect it against seismic activity.</p>

<p>Yana is very beautiful, yes. It&rsquo;s a very serious place, in the sense that you can feel the volatility of things around you. Out on the coasts, growing up is very different. The weather is better and the cities are bigger; there&rsquo;s more to do. In Yana, it was quite a serious place to grow up, you see. You are in better contact with the Earth &ndash; not in some abstract sense, but in a very real fear of what it might produce.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ndash; Ayn Rumouisen</p>
<p>Yana has been inhabited since the 17th Century or so, dated mostly to the erection of the town of Yana&rsquo;s community hall in 1644. Like many of its neighbouring boroughs, its initial settlement was spurred by an interest in its mineral-rich volcanic soil, which offered good growing for staple Vekllei foods like wheat and potatoes.</p>
<p>In 1856, the Beri Railroad Bridge was constructed across Sesmiousvianneh river, which allowed for easy export to Vekllei&rsquo;s wealthy coastal communities. The structure operated for nearly a hundred years, until the wooden bridge was washed away in 1948 by heavy rains, taking Locomotive No. 6004 and its engineers with it.</p>

<p>In May 2006, heavy rains over the <em>Skusme</em> glacier caused the Sesmiousvianneh river to swell over its banks and flood the town of Beri, washing away several homes and a mill. Nearly 150 people died as their homes were swept away, making it the largest flooding disaster in recent Vekllei memory, and is remembered each year across all towns of the borough.</p>

<p>During the Floral Period, Yana was marked by the Vekllei Beautification Bureau as a successful example of &ldquo;traditional Lava [region] community living and culture,&rdquo; and suggested using it as a blueprint for further development of Lava&rsquo;s isolated and often agricultural villages. The town of Yana was further recognised as Vekllei&rsquo;s &ldquo;10th most beautiful city&rdquo; in the architecture/holiday magazine <em>Alive</em> in 2044.</p>

<p>The area around Yana is ringed by flower-tundras, though the settlements within it are characterised by low-lying grass plains and cold-weather mosses. Ancient lava flows form striking stone rivers across the interior of the borough, making it among Vekllei&rsquo;s most alien inhabited landscapes. Thermal pools are common, scattered across the landscape like mirrors, and plumes of volcanic steam can be seen from all of its towns.</p>
