	  <description>߷ This page lists completed articles on Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s boroughs ⚠️ This list is evolving, and will be expanded in future. Over the next year I&amp;rsquo;ll be completing this list of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s 100 boroughs, and linking them to images and posts produced in the project. Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s five Crown Boroughs (once included) will be highlighted in bold. A Vekllei borough is an unusual administrative designation, portioned originally by a set of vague criteria that includes size, history, its unique geography, culture, and its spiritual value.</description>
