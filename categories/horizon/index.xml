	  <description>Genesis of Utopia # Vekllei did not originate in Lola &amp;ndash; according to the Saga of Origins, Vekllei emerged from the corpse of a petty creator god named Oslola. But there was some truth in casting Lola as the genesis of the Vekllei nation-state, since this is where Scandinavian settlers first landed over three thousand years ago, and was where the 1st and 2nd Commonwealths consolidated their power and united the Vekllei Islands.</description>

	  <description>A New Format for Stories from Vekllei # Vekllei has one hundred boroughs that are usually characterised as the foundation of the Vekllei city-state. Some, like Bakur, have only a few thousand people in them. Others, like the Great Coast, have over a million.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on this project for a while now, about five years counting backwards, and in that time what Vekllei means to me has matured.</description>
