      <title>Atlantic Boredom</title>

      <description>For a brief period of time, Zelda and Cobian took it upon themselves to make something of their youth. Cobian fancied herself a gymnast, and though this ambition arrived too late and left too soon, she was quite good at it for a while. Tzipora was better suited on the trampoline, where her stiff leg didn‚Äôt give her as much trouble.
They trained for about two hours, and after practice they met up to travel home together.</description>

      <title>Absolute Quiet</title>

      <description>There were plumes in the sky, sent from bunkers buried deep in the well of the Earth, killing with switches. Vekllei went to war, and so Tzipora went to war with it.
The throbbing machinery of another world began turning, and anyone who saw the bomb would hear it. Passing seconds dislocated and caught heartbeats. The plumes were pretty. It was such a shame, those plumes. It was a quiet afternoon in the flower-tundras.</description>

      <description>Unique among girls #  There are a lot of things Tzipora does differently to everybody else, and they start to make a lot more sense when you realise Tzipora either does not realise she is unusual, or does not care.
She has a lot of endearing characteristics that give great character to her mannerisms and physicality. She has a small overbite that makes her look a little froggy, and ritually pulls on her shirt and wipes her nose in anxious conversation.</description>

      <title>Base Camp</title>

      <description>Just a paint-sketch.
The puffin scouts set up camp not far from the rest, just outside of Krafla in the Lava region. When they moved south tomorrow, thick native grasses and trees would give way to flower-tundras and bare hills, and by Tuesday they‚Äôd be in the heart of Lava ‚Äî empty and extraterrestrial and volcanic.
The Krafla high-energy communications tower was visible from all over the region. It provided uninterrupted radio to most of North Lava, and could relay signals through satellites.</description>

      <title>Tzipora‚Äôs ‚ÄòEvery Day Carry‚Äô</title>

      <description>Like a lot of girls of poverty, Tzipora was very possessive of her things. No food was ever left on her plate. There was a deep anxiety that whatever wasn‚Äôt claimed would be lost.
She was also naturally obsessive and material-oriented, keenly aware of the importance of objects measured by metrics in her own silly head. You can discover a lot about a person from their trinkets and toys ‚Äî let‚Äôs discover a bit about Tzipora.</description>

      <title>A Most Beautiful Woman</title>

      <description>When Tzipora first laid eyes on Ayn, hours after her arrival in the country, she thought, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the most beautiful woman I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äù
It wasn‚Äôt just her features or figure that captured Tzipora‚Äôs attention ‚Äî it was also her confident, inconspicuous movements and a quiet self-assuredness that seemed obvious in her gentle expression and posture. Tzipora was not quite sure how to describe it. Her beauty was very alive in the way she inhabited a space, as she walked into the hotel lounge to meet them.</description>

      <description>Tzipora had been ejected from the operations room once the guys arrived. She knew what was going down, anyway. No specifics. But you didn‚Äôt bring in uniformed soldiers for regular business. National Intelligence liked to work with their own people.
Five days prior, Baron hailed an EB/NI company car and it pulled up beside him. The electric passenger window slid down. Baron nodded at the passenger.
‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs in here. There‚Äôs more if you need it.</description>

      <title>The Last Train Out of Ada</title>

      <description>They both watched as train 416 pulled away from the platform. And that was that ‚Äî there would be no school in the morning. That was how it worked in rural Vekllei, a million miles from the automatic trains on endless timetables. Out here, you paced life around the station.
There was not much to say about this, between the two of them. Tzipora looked at Cobian and pulled a froggy smile that tried to express that it was nobody‚Äôs fault.</description>

      <title>The Trials of Cobian</title>
      <link>https://wiki.millmint.studio/posts/2020-05-02-trials/</link>

      <description>According to her friends, Tzipora‚Äôs contemporary afflictions were tragic. Her medical problems; her violent childhood; her sensitivity and melancholy ‚Äî you could feel sorry for her, because a lot of her problems were not her fault. She invoked sympathy.
Tzipora never considered herself particularly tragic. It seemed straightforward, if difficult; she continued to live ‚Äî and so she lived. Tzipora&amp;rsquo;s sympathy was instead reserved for her first and closest friend: Cobian.</description>
