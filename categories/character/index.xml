This article appeared in Issue #6 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.   For a brief period of time, Zelda and Cobian took it upon themselves to make something of their youth.

This article appeared in Issue #5 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.   People are not sure what to make of Baron. They are not sure what to make of his daughter, Tzipora, either. To that end, they are lucky to have found each other.

She had found adult life completely disappointing, and never moved out of home. In her last summer, she developed a desperate fascination with her receding childhood, and eventually took her own life outside of the classroom she’d studied in as a third-grade student.</description>

The puffin scouts set up camp not far from the rest, just outside of Krafla in the Lava region.

This article appeared in Issue #3 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.   Like a lot of girls of poverty, Tzipora was very possessive of her things. No food was ever left on her plate. There was a deep anxiety that whatever wasn’t claimed would be lost.
She was also naturally obsessive and material-oriented, keenly aware of the importance of objects measured by metrics in her own silly head.</description>

This article appeared in Issue #2 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.   When Tzipora first laid eyes on Ayn, hours after her arrival in the country, she thought, “that’s the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen.”
