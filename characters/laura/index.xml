	  <![CDATA[Laura drives an Avro GTV for work. Less than 10% of Vekllei people have drivers licenses. The only good thing about working for the Bureau of Housing, as far as Laura is concerned, is that she gets a company car.
Because government cars are made to the same standard as police cruisers, they&rsquo;re actually really sporty little things beneath their plain exterior.]]>

	  <![CDATA[Astrid (left) likes her job. Laura (right) is only here because she dropped out of chemistry at Montre University. Astrid and Laura are junior inspectors for the Bureau of Housing, which fields concerns from homeowners in municipalised homes.
In Vekllei, land &ldquo;owns itself&rdquo; as a seperate entity, and state and private ownership are a contract with that land. As such, land ownership is an overlapping claim by these three agents.]]>

<p>Astrid and Laura are junior inspectors for the <a style="color: var(--color-commons)" href="/bureau-of-housing/"><span class="fi fi-min-commons fis"></span> Bureau of Housing</a>, which fields concerns from homeowners in municipalised homes.</p>
<p>In Vekllei, land &ldquo;owns itself&rdquo; as a seperate entity, and state and private ownership are a contract with that land. As such, land ownership is an overlapping claim by these three agents.</p>
<p>Inspectors like these assist courts by reporting the condition and stewardship of land, since stewardship (i.e. use, improvement and care of land) is often a determining factor of ownership.</p>
