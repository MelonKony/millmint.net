I have a research proposal due today, and since I'm pretending to still be a university student I suppose I'd better do it.

I spend a lot of time thinking about what the hell I'm doing with my life, and after a while I get hungry. Banjos -- a very Australian name for a bakery chain -- satiates my existential hunger with two bacon and cheese pull-apart loaves for $10. I don't know what that would be in American money. Probably like $6.80 or some bullshit because our exchange rate is absolutely not very fair dinkum at the moment.

I suppose what I'm saying is I eat as lot of bread, and I appreciate you guys being here for it. I despise the idea of myself blogging but sometime I need an outlet.
