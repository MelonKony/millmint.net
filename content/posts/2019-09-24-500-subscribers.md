Thank you very much everyone. It's very exciting for me. I ordered a cake from Banjos to celebrate but Tzipora got it all over the floor and herself.

Thanks for subscribing. I've been pushing myself a bit too hard and my writing's suffered for it. I'm not sure I can slow down, I'm just not that kind of guy, but I want to promise some exciting adventures in the future as we hang out with Zelda and her loved ones.

Here's to a thousand! My goal is to get bigger than the main worldbuilding subreddit. Only a few hundred thousand to go.

In the meantime, feel free to stick around, enjoy the party, scrape whatever cake you can off the floor and have a good time with Zelda and me.
