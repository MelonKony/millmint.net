Sorry for breaking my streak everyone, I'm on beta software and it totally shit the bed these last couple days. I'll be doing my best to hobble along until full release :)

Tzipora is easily squished. In this picture Moise would be around 16, Cobian 15, and Tzipora about 18.

Moise has lost a lot of weight and has been blessed with a hefty frame befitting his temperament. Tzipora 's tastes in clothes are specific and mostly unchanging, except for a brief phase a few years after her arrival where she started poaching neckties for her own use. Cobian is conscious of and struggles with the fact that she is not particularly photogenic.
