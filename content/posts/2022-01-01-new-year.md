‚ùñ **Welcome to 2022,** year of Vekllei. Here's to a great year of art, dreams and love.

Tzipora spent the lunar solstice of 2067 with Ayn and Baron on one of the warm steam lakes of Flous. The lake was near where Ayn's parents lived, and they sailed across it on a wooden boat her father had made nearly 50 years before. Time was cyclical out here; it folded in on itself.
