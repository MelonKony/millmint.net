Hello everyone,

Hobart here, creator of this whole thing. For a couple years now I've maintained a small [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/vekllei) for those interested in supporting my work. Like most Patreons, this has operated monthly.

From now on, **patrons will only be charged on the release of a comic chapter**. This could be once a month, but will more likely be a bit longer. This means a little less money for me, but also less anxiety about producing enough public work to earn the money pledged to me. It seems more fair, and the comic will be worth it.

So what will change? For patrons, **nothing will change except that you will be charged less frequently**. You will continue to recieve precisely the same benefits I've promised, including future merch and roles on the Vekllei Discord.

**I will continue to produce standalone posts,** much as I always have -- but instead of battling a creeping anxiety of losing patrons if I don't meet a post quota, I'll be working more creatively and flexibly according to the needs of the comic. My work will be better for it, I reckon.

**In summary:**
* Supporters will now be charged on the release of each chapter of the comic, instead of monthly.
* Merch and Discord rewards will be the same.
* You won't pay as frequently and will get more for your money as chapters come out.
* If you'd like to support me in other ways, maybe buy a postcard when the MillMint Shop launches!

If you have any questions, just leave a comment below and I'll help you out.

Thanks always,

Hobart/MelonKony
