Coming up on 2am here in East Australia. Had a rough day at work. Feeling pretty isolated and my other job starts in a few hours. I don’t know if it’s intrusive thoughts from OCD or just something everyone has, but four or five times a day I’ll have some sort of regret pop right into my head. I can’t seem to move on from much. Tzipora’s the same. She’s probably thinking about physical education from early that day. She’s thinking about faking a sick note so she doesn’t have to do it anymore. She cringes and curses under her breath and then the memory passes.

I like drawing her at home, but the proportion’s all shot to shit and it took way too long for such a simple sketch. Doesn’t matter though, it turned out pretty close to how I wanted.

You got any similar experiences or anything, feel free to comment.
