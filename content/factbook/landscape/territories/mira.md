## Overview

The **Island Commonwealth of Mira** (also ***Madeira*** in Portuguese) is an island archipelago situated in the Atlantic, 520km west of Morocco. Originally a Portuguese overseas territory, Mira became an independent member of the [Council of Oceans](/oceans-council/) in 2025 and entered the [Commonwealth of Oceans](/vekllei/) as a [Constituent](/constituents/) in 2030. As such, its primary languages are Portuguese and English, and as of the mid-21st Century it is still integrating with Commonwealth government.
