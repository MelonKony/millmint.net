The **Second Portuguese Republic** (commonly *Portugal*) was a Portuguese state that existed between 1926 and 2014. It succeeded the democratic First Republic and Portuguese Empire, and was ruled by the *Estado Novo* regime.

Portugal was incorporated into Iberia following the Spanish invasion of Portugal at the turn of the 21st Century. Portugal's defeat and subsequent annexation ended its independence and brought an end to the Portuguese Colonial War, which in turn decolonised most of its former empire.

Several former Portuguese territories are part of [<span class="fi fi-com"></span> Vekllei](/vekllei/) today. These include:
