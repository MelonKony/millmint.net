A **constituent** (also *constituent commonwealth*) is a type regional government in {{<link/vekllei>}} that exercises control over multiple [republics](/republics/). It is an intermediate administrative body with special privileges and responsibilities.

Constituent commonwealths have their own suite of [ministries](/ministries/) and a {{<link/assembly>}}, and exercise power comparable to a state in other federal countries. In practice, they are represent common regional interests of individual [republics](/republics) in the [Commonwealth government](/government/).



## Public Policy

The Commonwealth devolves certain aspects of public policy to Constituents. In practice, many devolved matters practice parity with Commonwealth [ministries](/ministries/) and [councils](/councils/), and so are functionally identical to Commonwealth central policy.

* Environment
* Fire and rescue services
* Health services
* [Municipal matters](/municipalities/)

Many other aspects of government and public administration are facilitated by Commmonwealth secretariats directly. Further, many devolved matters rely on guidance from Commonwealth agencies to operate (e.g., distribution of utilities requires coordination with Commonwealth electric and water bureaus).
