## Public Policy

The Commonwealth devolves certain aspects of public policy to Constituents. In practice, many devolved matters practice parity with Commonwealth [ministries](/ministries/) and [councils](/councils/), and so are functionally identical to Commonwealth central policy.

**Devolved Matters**
* Agriculture and resource development
* Culture
* Economic development
* Environment
* Fire and rescue services
* Health services
* [Municipal matters](/municipalities/)
  * Housing
  * Utility distribution networks
* Sport and recreation
* Tourism
* Town and country planning

Many other aspects of government and public administration are facilitated by Commmonwealth secretariats directly. Further, many devolved matters rely on guidance from Commonwealth agencies to operate (e.g., distribution of utilities requires coordination with Commonwealth electric and water bureaus).
