## Overview

Through its Economic Development Office attached to the {{<link/ministry-of-commerce>}}, Vekllei still courts foreign investment as persistently as it did during its uncertain years of independence. Emerging

## Practice

Vekllei does not withold tax on money made by overseas companies, and so Vekllei's capital area is abundant with regional offices from General Electric, Teletype, Fawkes & Hastings Ltd., etc.
