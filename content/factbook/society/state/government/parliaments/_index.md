The Commonwealth *councils*, known as *secretariats* in Vekllei, are a superior kind of ministry headed by a secretary. Vekllei Ministries answer to the Commonwealth Parliament, whereas *councils* report directly to the [Commonwealth Council](/council/). In practice, *councils* are federalised and so carry out their roles directly, unlike the devolved ministries.
