The *National Mint of Vekllei* (also the *Mint*) is the sole producer of currency in Vekllei, tasked with minting and melting the Vekllei Crown. It also regulates gold bullion in the country, and manufactures bullion for use in the International Market. It is headquartered in Vekllei Proper, in the Home Islands. The Mint also produces paper government certificates and security documents.

The Mint is the custodian of the Commonwealth Bullion Depository, which holds reserves of over 6,000 tonnes of gold bullion belonging to the Commonwealth and over 60 other countries, and is among the largest such reserves in the world.

The Mint is well-regarded internationally for the purity of its metals and intricate commemorative coins, leading international numismatics in colour and variety.
