The <span class="fi fi-min-commsec fis"></span> **Commonwealth Securities Exchange** (Commsec, or CSX) is a [government corporation](/state-industry/) that operates the national securities and commodities market in {{<link/vekllei>}}. It is supervised by the {{<link/bureau-of-securities>}}. The corporation is itself listed on the CSX.

The CSX is measured by two common indexes: the CSX All Ordinaries and the CRC/CSX 50.

* The CSX All Ordinaries index lists the top 500 constituents by market capitalisation, reflecting the size of the overall CSX share market.
* The [CRC/CSX 50](/ratings/) indexes only the top 50 constituents and implements liquidity requirements to improve tradability and act as a benchmark for investor returns.

The All Ordinaries is rebalanced annually, whereas the CRC/CSX 50 is rebalanced quarterly.

The CSX maintains systems to aid foreign investment, and is often characterised as the entry point to the Vekllei industrial economy. Since most Vekllei people are unbanked and do not handle money, the CSX is primarily a mechanism for government, industry, and private foreign investors.
