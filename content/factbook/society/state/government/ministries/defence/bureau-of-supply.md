The *Bureau of Supply* is a specialised defence organ that coordinates supply and logistics for the Crown Armed Forces and security services of Vekllei, including its policing and intelligence services. The Bureau of Supply also administrates the network of Crown Ordnance Factories and the production and acquisition of aircraft and vehicles. It is not responsible for strategic decisions about the make and type of supply, only the facilitation and distribution of the purchase.
