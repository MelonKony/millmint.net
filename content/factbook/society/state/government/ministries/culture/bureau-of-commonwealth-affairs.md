#### Religious Affairs Office

The COLSEC *Religious Affairs Office* (COLSERE) is responsible for reporting religious trends across the Commonwealth, particularly as they intersect with religious infrastructure (places of worship and natural shrines) and organised religion. Its focus is mostly external, since the *Upen*'s animism in the Home Islands lacks conventional religious hierarchies. COLSERE also serves as an advisory body to COLSEC command and as reporting agency for discrimination and concerns of faith.
