The Commonwealth Affairs Office is a body of the [<span class="fi fi-min-culture fis"></span> Ministry of Culture](/colsec/) responsible for the documentation of the general disposition, welfare, culture and demography of the people in {{<link/vekllei>}}. This includes political attitudes towards the Commonwealth itself, as well as how decisions made by other Secretariats impact public opinion. It is also the body-advocate of the public of member states who are unable to appeal to their local government directly.
