{{</note>}}

The <span class="fi fi-min-light-and-water fis"></span> **Commonwealth Water Commission** (commonly *Hydroburo*) is responsible for providing potable drinking water, wastewater and stormwater services across {{<link/vekllei>}}. Water in Vekllei is universal and of good quality. The Hydroburo also maintains offices for sewerage, conservation, and construction.

In {{<link/oslola>}} and Kala, most drinking water comes from fresh glacial runoff that requires minimal treating. Industrial water consumption is provided by nuclear desalination plants operated by the Hydroburo.
