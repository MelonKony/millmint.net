The *Vekllei Water Commission* (Hydroburo) is responsible for providing potable drinking water, wastewater and stormwater services to the Vekllei Islands and most Commonwealth members. Water in Vekllei is universal and of good quality. The Hydroburo also maintains offices for sewerage, conservation, and construction.

In the Vekllei Islands and Kala, most drinking water comes from fresh glacial runoff that requires minimal treating. Industrial water consumption is provided by nuclear desalination plants operated by the Hydroburo.
