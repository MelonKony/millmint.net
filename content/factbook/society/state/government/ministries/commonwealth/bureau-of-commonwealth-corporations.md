The *Bureau of Commonwealth Corporations* manages state-owned companies across the Commonwealth, particularly those with considerable international trade. These include several major industrial firms in Vekllei, like General Reactor S.A. and International Rocketry S.A. Though the State Assets Directorate functions as an administrator, state-owned companies in Vekllei are operated independently of COSMOCOM and maintain their own budgets and finances.
