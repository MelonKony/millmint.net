The *Bureau of Commonwealth Corporations* manages state-owned companies across the Commonwealth, particularly those with considerable international trade. These include several major industrial firms in Vekllei, like {{<link/general-reactor>}} and International Rocketry S.A. Though the State Assets Directorate functions as an administrator, state-owned companies in Vekllei are operated independently of COSMOCOM and maintain their own budgets and finances.
