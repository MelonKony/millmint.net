The <span class="fi fi-min-commonwealth fis"></span> **Ministry of the Commonwealth** (COSMOCOM) is the organ through which the Interior Parliament communicates and cooperates with the Commonwealth Parliament and its secretariats. Its primary responsibility is cooperation between member states and standardisation, and publishes reports and manuals towards this goal. It is also the primary ministry through which the subordinates of the Commonwealth influence the Interior Parliament. COSMOCOM is also responsible for ensuring changes made to the Floral Constitution are implemented domestically. Common responsibilities of COSMOCOM include:

* Advising, training and auditing local accreditation and qualifications in line with Commonwealth standards and directives.
* Ensuring that the Vekllei interior state meets standards determined by the Commonwealth parliaments and international commitments.
* Developing and enforcing standards in technical, industrial and brand features of the Interior Government and its responsible state assets and bureau partners.
* Training and maintaining the workforce for the Interior civil service and Interior state assets in line with Commonwealth standards and directives.

COSMOCOM's commitments to the transnational Commonwealth Parliaments go both ways -- the ministry ensures domestic compliance and also advises Commonwealth policy and standards, since the Vekllei Interior Government is the largest and most industrious member-state of the Commonwealth.
