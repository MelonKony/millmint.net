The *Civil Service Academy* (CSA) is a training school for middle and senior civil servants and interior policy researchers. Headquartered in [<span class="fi fi-mira"></span> Mira](/mira/), it primarily trains servants of the domestic government apparatuses, and provides tertiary courses in governance and management related to its primary disciplines. The CSA also trains directors of key state assets, and provides education resources for bureau industry.

Most Vekllei nationals in Commonwealth offices are also trained at the CSA, which has sister offices in most independent Commonwealth member-states.
