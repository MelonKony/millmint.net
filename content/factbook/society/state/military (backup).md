The armed forces of {{<link/vekllei>}} are part of the {{<link/ministry-of-defence>}}, and consist of the combined armed capability of the country, as well as services for public emergencies, law enforcement and civil defence.

Unlike common practice overseas, Vekllei does not have seperate military branches, and instead administers all aspects of defence as a single armed organisation originating as part of the Navy. As a union of island communities, the Vekllei Navy is its historic and contemporary primary means of defence, and Vekllei doctrine favours an integrated command. As such, all air and land warfare is conducted as part of the Navy under a unified defence command.

Because all services operate within the Navy, different roles are organised into different services. For example, the traditional surface navy of the [Maritime Service](#maritime-service) does not operate its own seaborne aviation, since all aircraft are part of the Navy's [Air Service](#air-service). In this context, "Navy" is a synonym for "Military" in Vekllei, and equipment, signage and vehicles are marked as such.

## Vekllei Military Services

A Vekllei military service is a component of the overall armed forces, and so they overlap and intersect. Unlike most other militaries, which are divided between different branches and coordinated by a central command, Vekllei military services are effectively interchangeable, and form *interarmes services* for specific missions. A single *interarmes service* may even involve regiments from all services simultaneously, which would operate as a single unit under a unified command.

Vekllei is a seagoing country of island communities, and so the Marine Services are the backbone of its strategic forces. They are the oldest military organisations of Vekllei and revered by the country.

{{<hint>}}
**Note**

In numbered Vekllei services (e.g. Terrestrial & Air Services, etc.), numerical order is preserved and units are not permanently identified by a particular number. Unit numbers are administrative and assist in formation of interarmes services, so units may change numbers regularly. Instead, unit identity and honours are attached to ceremonial and historical names that remain with the unit.

### <span class="navicon">⚓️</span> Marine Services

The Marine Services consist of the armed forces most commonly associated with seaborne warfare and supply, and include equivalents to the Navy and Coast Guard. It is an administrative rather than conceptual distinction, as many other aspects of oceangoing warfare are folded into the air and territorial services, such as naval aviation and marine infantry.

{{<hint panel>}}
#### Maritime Service

The **Maritime Service** (the **Navy** or *Navy of the Public*) is the traditional naval warfare component of the Vekllei military and consists of its surface ships and submarines.

{{< details title="Maritime Service Fleet" open=false >}}
##### Commonwealth Fleet

The Commonwealth Fleet (*Sovereign/Central Fleet*) of the Vekllei Maritime Service is the largest naval formation in Vekllei and is tasked with defence of the country's central corridor, a triangular area with points in {{<link/oslola>}}, Verde and {{<link/summers>}}

##### Home Fleet

The Home Fleet of the Vekllei Maritime Service is a reserve frigate fleet stationed across the 70 island city-states that make up the country. Each Vekllei city-state serves as a home port to a particular frigate. While they serve a pseduo-ceremonial role, they are active warships that perform littoral maritime security duties and can be federalised into other fleets as necessary. The Home Fleet also consists of auxiliary and littoral vessels designed for service in the Vekllei Caribbean.

### <span class="navicon">🗡️</span> Land and Army Services

{{<hint panel>}}
#### Territorial Service

The Vekllei **Territorial Service** is the closest analogue to a conventional army in the Vekllei military and comprises the majority of its professional fighting force. All Rifles regiments are trained as marine infantry, and Vekllei does not maintain dedicated marine regiments. All Territorial regiments are a part of the [Commonwealth Guard](#commonwealth-guard) and are federalised the same way, but are distinguished by their professional service and expeditionary posture.

{{<details "Rifles Service Structure">}}
##### Rifle Regiments
Rifles regiments consist of 1,000 men, and can be assembled into larger divisional units. Regiment numbers are administrative only and so can change, and regiments are identified with inherited names with honours instead. Rifles are mechanised with armoured cars.  Policy is to have a standing army 50,000 strong, but the 26th-50th Rifles regiments are activated as they are combat-ready, and so the 50th and 49th are often deactivated between training.

All Rifles are trained as both marine infantry and air assault regiments, and are

##### Commonwealth Guard Regiments

The Commonwealth Guard is the national militia and primary reserve force of the Territorial Services. It is federalised by default, and contributes its servicemen for the Rifles and other territorial regiments. As such, all Territorial servicemen are part of a Commonwealth Guards regiment, but in regular service are assigned to active units in other services. Only reservists, trainees and officers remained attached to the Guard while it is federalised.
