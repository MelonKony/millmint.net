߷ This *[ministry](/ministries/)* is part of {{<link/vekllei>}}.
{{</hint>}}

The armed forces of {{<link/vekllei>}} are part of the {{<link/ministry-of-defence>}}, and consist of the combined armed capability of the country, as well as services for public emergencies, law enforcement and civil defence.

Unlike common practice overseas, Vekllei does not have seperate military branches, and instead administers all aspects of defence as part of the Navy. As a union of island communities, the Vekllei Navy is its historic and contemporary primary means of defence, and Vekllei doctrine favours an integrated command. As such, all air and land warfare is conducted as part of the Navy under a unified defence command.

Because all services operate within the Navy, different roles are organised into different services. For example, the traditional surface navy of the [Maritime Service](#maritime-service) does not operate its own seaborne aviation, since all aircraft are part of the Navy's [Air Service](#air-service).
