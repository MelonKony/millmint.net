**The Army Construction House** (ACH) is the largest construction company in the Commonwealth by gross revenue and number of employees, most of whom are conscripts in the [compulsory service scheme](/corsosva/). It is a part of the Armed Forces of Vekllei, and subsequently reports directly to the palace. In practice, it consists of dozens of smaller companies that are administered by the Ministry of Defence in its local member-state.
