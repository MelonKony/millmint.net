**Commonwealth Airways** (formerly *Commonwealth Royal Airways*) is the flag carrier of {{<link/vekllei>}} and its largest airline. It is a [government-owned corporation](/assets/) [jointly owned](/bulletin/government-ownership/) by the [<span class="fi fi-min-commons fis"></span> Bureau of Aerospace](/bureau-of-aerospace/), and operates most of the country's civil air infrastructure.

The Commonwealth Airways corporation is the parent of several airlines that serve different roles. Commonwealth Overseas Airways, for example, provides international services and specialises in foreign bookings and money-handling. Commonwealth Airlink on the other hand is a domestic service, primarily serving routes between Vekllei's many small islands with light aircraft.
