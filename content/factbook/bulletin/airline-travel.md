**Summary**

* Most people in Vekllei do not use money and are essentially unbanked. This raises interesting problems of fairness in cases of scarcity.
* As a common example of how ticketing works in Vekllei, we can look to airlines and how they allocate seats.
* Air travel is generally accessible to ordinary Vekllei people. Commonwealth Airways helps connect the distant republics of Vekllei and emphasise their shared values.


. Traditional booking 6 months out with 20% reserved. Remaining 20% is reserved and allocated via staff travel system with companies granted slots

Almost every Vekllei person flies, and some fly frequently. They fly with the only airline that will take them -- Commonwealth Airways (previously Commonwealth Royal Airways). Founded in 1918, it is the oldest airline still operating.
