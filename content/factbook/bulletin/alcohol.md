**Summary**

* Vekllei people like alcohol, and in their society it is widely available at no cost.
* These facts set the country up for catastrophe: alcohol abuse is a social disease that destroys lives and deeply impacts communities.
* Consequently, its consumption as enabled by the system must also be curbed by the system. This is helped by considered policy, but the Vekllei government targets another aspect of control: culture.
* As such, Vekllei is an interesting case study in how the country attempts to encourage social behaviours more broadly.

{{<link/vekllei>}} people, like many others around the world, like to drink. As a feature of their society and its [social economy](/social-economy/), alcohol is free and available. They drink often and socially, and is an important lubricant of conversation and merryment around the country.

Like any product of pleasure, however, unrestricted availability poses a severe problem for their society. The dangers are straightforward -- alcohol encourages all kinds of antisocial behaviours, and risks developing into chronic addiction that can ruin lives and destroy families. In this context, the tension between Vekllei's *laissez-faire* society and the common good are most pronounced, precisely because alcohol wears down the social norms that facilitate their close-knit and codependent way of life.

The solution they practice is twofold:

## Control through policy

Vekllei has controls on both the supply and consumption of alcohol. Public drunkenness, as well as adjacent antisocial behaviours, are a crime with straightforward legal repercussions. Onetime drunkenness in the street might result in a few hours of contributory service.[^service] Antisocial offences motivated by alcohol consumption carry weightier punishments. Repeat offending easily results in direct state intervention, and may manifest as time in rehabilitation centres or even mental asylums.

Vekllei also has strict laws on the service of alcohol. It has to be provided by licensed establishments.[^establishments] These laws also dictate responsible provision of alcohol. It is illegal to:

* Permit drunkenness on the premises
* Serve alcohol to drunk people
* Allow people who are violent, quarrelsome, disorderly or behaving indecently on licensed premises

Only drinks with low alcohol content and wine are typically available at home. Everything else must be drunk at licensed premises, and consequently are subject to these laws to curb their drinking.

## Control through culture

Perhaps more important, and often overlooked, is the way Vekllei uses policy indirectly to influence drinking culture. These approaches are often indirect, and lie outside the legal system. Despite its firm hand on the supply of alcohol, for example, Vekllei has no minimum drinking age at home. In fact, from fourteen years old, students may choose to have a small cup of red wine with their school meals.

Vekllei society, with guidance from government and industry, has attempted to minimise the harmful effects of binge drinking by, essentially, spreading alcohol consumption out throughout the day. Workplaces serve aperitifs in the afternoon, and a few drinks with dinner is common. Vekllei cuisine pairs alcohol with meals -- it is not inappropriate or unusual to have paired liqueurs in professional lunches, or entertaining clients.

Consuming smaller amounts more commonly has been shown, in most cases, to provide better outcomes for both health and behaviour. Introducing this practice to teenagers through school has also helped reduce the rates of early binge drinking in the country.

This is not to suggest that these two methods have resolved antisocial drinking or prevented alcoholism -- this is not the case. Vekllei is a large and diverse country, and though its quality of life has improved dramatically, the control of access to alcohol is not perfect, nor would perfect control totally prevent the disease of alcoholism. Vekllei ranks 13th for alcohol consumption per capita, and tens of thousands of Vekllei people die a year drinking it. They are a country that likes to drink, and they have poorer health for it.

What it does suggest, however, is the overall outline of Vekllei's approach to fostering a strong civic culture in their social economy. The whole system is predicated on it, because happy communities foster their own productivity and improvement. Their dual approach -- reinforcement of good (or at least preferable) habits through culture and restriction of bad ones through law -- is typical of the country's approach to social disease.

[^service]: Contributory service is the Vekllei equivalent of community service overseas. It is a light punishment, usually applied to misdemeanours and minor offences, that requires certain hours of work to alleviate the (usually antisocial) offence. The type of work required is scaled to the seriousness of the offence.
[^establishments]: In Vekllei, these are usually cafes, pubs, restaurants and bars, in that order of availability. Noncompliance with alcohol laws are a fast way to having your business shut down.
