**Summary**

* An understandable assumption is that [moneylessness](/social-economy/) would essentially separate Vekllei's *social economy* from real economic competitiveness or traditional valuation.
* This line of thinking recognises the radically different factors of labour and value in Vekllei, but does not adequately explain the extremely high measurements of productivity in the country, which correctly reflect its growth, competitiveness and high standards of living.
* In this sense, economic productivity in Vekllei is very high and of obvious interest to other countries, which have begun to experiment with the computerisation of economic data.
* The causes of this trend, as well as its future obstacles, are both

Productivity is an equation drawing data from technology, policy, and the social aspects of the {{<link/vekllei>}} economy. It measures overall the ratio between input and output, which can indicate efficiency, growth and competitiveness.

Conventional labour-value measurement is incomplete in the Vekllei system, however. While labour is inversely much more valuable in a moneyless economy for its secure and participatory nature, labour hours do not reflect the majority expense (and therefore input ratio) of the Vekllei economy.

The reason for this is straightforward -- Vekllei in its domestic market does not use money, and therefore employees are not paid and do not impose a salary burden on a company. Their remuneration is more complicated and harder to quantify materially, including public-provided goods and services (education, housing, food) and social relationships and gifts.

In capital terms, the largest average expense of most industries are [raw commodities](/bulletin/natural-commodities/), electricity, land use and imported technology that services the industrial economy. Consequently, productivity in Vekllei includes indexes of these factors, as a measurement of *total* or *multifactor* productivity.

Core drivers of productivity in {{<link/vekllei>}} are

{{<hint panel>}}
1. **High public investment from autonomous but coordinated productivity drivers like governments and firms**
	<br>
	The Vekllei economy is highly centralised in policy but devolved in structure, and there are clear lines of communication between municipal, republican, commonwealth and federal governments regarding opportunities for investment and improvement. Investment is spurred by the major firms of the Vekllei economy, some of which are [government-owned](/state-industry/). The country has historically high levels of public investment and the government plays a significant role in the economy.
2. **Rapid advancement of labour-saving technologies like robotics and automatic factory schematics**
	<br>
	The basic Vekllei standard of living is mostly the product of automatic factories. Food, housing, clothing, electricity and heat are produced by robots and universalised schematics.
3. **High standard of education, job performance and innovation among its workers**
	<br>
	Vekllei has among the highest rate of teachers per capita in the world, and education is universal and free from kindergarten through university. They
4. **An advanced and high-skill economy that makes good use of labour**
	<br>
	Much of the Vekllei economy is geared towards maintenance of their quality of life. Beyond this standard established by the government, exports.

Regarding labour, the *social economy* is a shorthand for the realities of labour working in Vekllei. As a diverse and vast federal country, the practices and laws regarding labour vary between [republics](/republics/), but there common factors across them:

{{<hint panel>}}
1. Social and voluntary remuneration
2. Short working weeks
3. Local and personal employment
4. High-education and high-skill labour
5. High-trust society
{{</hint>}}

This is a workforce that, without a compelling wage, reject low-skill work. This further advantages Vekllei productivity by forcing the automation of factory labour (or simply disregarding it, as Vekllei does not have a consumer society) and relocating employment to high-value industries in services, research, civil service and finance.
