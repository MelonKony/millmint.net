**Summary**

* Vekllei has only 24 million people, equivalent roughly to Australia or Syria, but has many times the global influence of those countries.
* This is because of three factors: trade, cultural soft power, and foreign policy.
* Foreign Policy in Vekllei serves the interests of their state, but that does not mean that its efforts are entirely self-serving. Co-operation, collaboration and investment are the core principles of their approach.
* In fact, their style of earnest and fair diplomacy has, in general, succeeded dramatically. Pragmatic and effective policy has guaranteed their voice in many parts of the world.
* The results speak for themselves. For example, Vekllei has closer diplomatic and economic ties to many former French colonies in West Africa than France itself.

While {{<link/vekllei>}} has tremendous wealth and cultural diversity that more or less guarantee a minimum presence in global diplomacy, foreign policy is an area of active investment there and has been since independence. The {{<link/ministry-of-foreign-affairs>}} is among the largest and best-equipped devolved [ministries](/ministries/), and Vekllei has a diplomatic mission in nearly every country. These missions, comprising consulates, interest sites and embassies, are packed with diplomats and analysts familiar with the local territory.

The Bureau of Economics of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is a particularly keen outfit, taking on a variety of roles that may at times be generous, predatory or both. The people of the Bureau of Economics are not ideologues and they are not there to promote the [*commons*](/social-economy/). In developed countries, they aid the interests of Vekllei business and trade. In others, they act as a channel for direct investment, nation-building and aid. None of it is given without thought, or for mere political purposes. They aim to establish a base of knowledge and influence, and use those things to build up the nation-state.

These policies have no single coherent economic principles, but they do reflect Vekllei interests. Key concerns are education and healthcare, followed by investment in however the local economy works to encourage
