**Summary**

* Urban design in Vekllei encourages use of public spaces as an extension of the home
* Caf√©s, Cinemas, Cabarets and Department Stores are all common hang-outs. Traditional public spaces like parks, fountains and beaches are common too.
* To this end, it is common to see people lounging, talking or studying in public spaces like city squares and parks.
* Vekllei has 'right to roam' laws protecting non-intrusive passage across private or government property.
* Vekllei homes, while high quality, are often smaller than American detached housing. This encourages making use of common spaces for leisure.
