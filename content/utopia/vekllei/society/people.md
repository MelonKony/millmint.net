# üìú The People of Vekllei
## 1. Introduction

**Vekllei language**, abbreviated to just **Vekllei**, has six core sublanguages that are used commonly today. Although they often intersect, these different systems of communication are distinct languages in their own right, used for different purposes in different arenas of communication.

{{< details title="Language Systems in Vekllei" open=true >}}
1. **Spoken Vekllei**, which is everyday spoken language. It draws from two glossaries with different meanings and feelings, called *Oa* and *Loh*.
2. **Topet**, which are logographic characters (occasionally characterised as hieroglyphs). Like other pictographic languages, *Topet* characters can be broken down into repeating components, called *Topotte*.
3. **Rapotenne**, is the traditional logographic language of names. It is much older than Topet, and has more in common with spiritual runes than modern logography.
4. **Potenne**, lit. ‚Äú*Hand-Talk*‚Äù, is a sign language that incorporates gestures and signing to add meaning to emotion to spoken language, and occasionally in place of it.
5. **Upotenne**, lit. ‚Äú*Spirit-Hand-Talk*‚Äù, as the recreation of runes in human form, used limitedly in spiritual ritual.
6. **Vekllei Semaphore** is the codification of colour and shape. Traditionally limited to colour, shape and pattern are now also included in *Vekllei Semaphore*, in which full sentences can be formed.
