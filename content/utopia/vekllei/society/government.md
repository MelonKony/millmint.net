## Overview
{{< hint pink >}}
߷ This article is about [**Vekllei**](/utopia/vekllei) society
{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint panel >}}
**Vekllei** is positioned uniquely between the anarchy and control. This article looks at its government, which facilitates and manages these competing instincts. As the representative of the Vekllei state, and the body of its human interests, the Vekllei Government is second only to the Sovereign in its authority over Vekllei society.
{{< /hint >}}

<span class="fc">T</span>
**he Government of Vekllei** refers to both the [Administration of the Interior](/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#administration-of-the-interior) of the Vekllei [Home Islands](/utopia/vekllei/) and the [international governing body](/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#administration-of-the-commonwealth) of the Vekllei Commonwealth. This article serves as a handbook to all departments of the Vekllei Government, and will help clarify the structure and responsibilities of its subordinate ministries and secretariats.

### Structure

What we know as the Vekllei Government is actually portioned between several powerful state bodies, each representing the natural political concerns of the modern Vekllei state. These are, in no particular order:

* The internal governance of Vekllei
* The maintenance, development and security of the Vekllei Commonwealth, including its territories
* The rule of the Land Sovereign and its presence in the state

Accordingly, the Vekllei Government is separated into two governing bodies.

1. **The Palace of the Land Sovereign**
2. **The Government of the Vekllei Commonwealth, including Vekllei and its Atlantic possessions**

The following passages outline their structure and purpose as a general framework and reference for the political structure of the country.

# Government of the Vekllei Commonwealth

{{< hint panel >}}
**Since most Vekllei people** catch a train each day, VNR is a uniquely intimate and treasured organ of the Vekllei state. It is somehow exempted from the public apathy and resentment of bureaucracy that targets other monopolies of the Vekllei state, and is routinely regarded as among the most beloved and appreciated "companies" in Vekllei.
{{< /hint >}}

The Government of Vekllei is made up of Ministries, Offices, Bureaus, Commissions, Directorates and Secretariats depending on the size, purpose and organisation of the organ.

---

## Administration of the Interior

The *Administration of the Interior of the Government of Vekllei* (also known as the *Interior Government*) represents the human state of the Vekllei Home Islands, as well as its dependent possessions 

### Ministry of Commerce {{<boxtag pink>}}COSMOSOL{{</boxtag>}}

The Vekllei *Ministry of Commerce* (COSMOSOL) regulates and initiates trade in the country. Despite the functional moneylessness of the Commonwealth, COSMOSOL remains among the busiest ministries of the Interior Government, since all international trade and entitled renumeration (the Vekllei turn-of-phrase for withdrawing from the [Labour Bank](/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#labour-bank-of-vekllei)) occurs through its subordinate commissions. Common responsibilities of COSMOSOL include:

* Regulation and taxation of international trade, particularly through Government "White Bonds" and Labour Bank "Blue Bonds".
* Advising the Parliament on economic policy and foreign trade.
* Monitoring and reporting on the health of foreign markets.
* Printing and transporting currency.

{{<section>}}
#### Labour Bank of Vekllei

The *Labour Bank of Vekllei* (commonly "*Bank of Vekllei*") is the central bank and currency store of Vekllei. It is operated by the Ministry of Commerce and maintains branches in most major borough capitals in the Home Islands, as well as across all member states of the Vekllei Commonwealth. It is not autonomous and is beholden to the policy decisions of COSMOSOL and, in certain cases, the Interior and Commonwealth Parliaments. Its sworn purpose, as instructed by the Floral Constitution, is to advocate for Floral Economics. 

Vekllei citizens are entitled to an equal share of the money stored in the Labour Bank, and in certain circumstances may withdraw their balance to emigrate or travel abroad.

## Administration of the Commonwealth

Although each member of the Atlantic Commonwealth is considered a full participant of equal importance, administration in practice occurs in the Vekllei [Home Islands](/utopia/vekllei/), its most populous and industrious member state. Many features of Floral Society are universal among Commonwealth members, and the Administration of the Commonwealth serves, maintains and standardises the values of Floral Society across the Atlantic.

### Commonwealth Culture Secretariat {{<boxtag pink>}}COLSEC{{</boxtag>}}

The *Commonwealth Culture Secretariat* (COLSEC) is concerned primarily with "cultural values and beliefs" of the Commonwealth, their protection, and foreign relations.

{{<section>}}
#### Commonwealth Affairs Office

The COLSEC *Commonwealth Affairs Office* (COLSA) is responsible for the documentation of the general disposition, welfare, culture and demography of the people of the Commonwealth. This includes political attitudes towards the Commonwealth itself, as well as how decisions made by other Secretariats impact public opinion. It is also the body-advocate of the public of member states who are unable to appeal to their local government directly.

##### Religious Affairs Office

The COLSEC *Religious Affairs Office* (COLSERE) is responsible for reporting religious trends across the Commonwealth, particularly as they intersect with religious infrastructure (places of worship and natural shrines) and organised religion. Its focus is mostly external, since the *Upen*'s animism in the Home Islands lacks conventional religious hierarchies. COLSERE also serves as an advisory body to COLSEC command and as reporting agency for discrimination and concerns of faith.

##### Veteran Affairs Office

The COLSEC *Veteran Affairs Office* (COLVET) is responsible for organising healthcare, housing and support for all former members of the Commonwealth Armed Forces. It also serves as an advocacy body for veterans themselves, especially in arguing for material support from other departments within the government. COLVET is also responsible for formulating and advising policy on veteran affairs to Commonwealth and Interior Parliaments.

##### Civil Affairs Office

The COLSEC *Civil Affairs Office* (COLSECA) is responsible for the health of the government of its member states and the maintenance of COLSEC guidelines on Floral Society. It serves as a political school for Floral politics and as the support mechanism for natural disasters, public unrest and other threats to the stability of its member states. 

##### Cultural Heritage Affairs Office

The COLSEC Cultural Heritage Affairs Office (COLSEHE)

##### Overseas Affairs Office

The COLSEC Overseas Affairs Office coordinates (COLSESEA) the foreign offices of the Commonwealth, particularly for states that lack their own foreign affairs offices in [Kalina](/utopia/vekllei/landscape/territories/kalina) and the [West Antilles](/utopia/vekllei/landscape/territories/west). It also serves as an advisory board for policy and trade with other countries, particularly as they interact with autonomous states.
