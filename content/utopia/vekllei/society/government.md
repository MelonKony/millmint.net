## Overview
{{< hint pink >}}
߷ This article is about [**Vekllei**](/utopia/vekllei) society
{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint panel >}}
**Vekllei** is positioned uniquely between the anarchy and control. This article looks at its government, which facilitates and manages these competing instincts. As the representative of the Vekllei state, and the body of its human interests, the Vekllei Government is second only to the Sovereign in its authority over Vekllei society.
{{< /hint >}}

<span class="fc">T</span>
**he Government of Vekllei** refers to both the [Administration of the Interior](/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#administration-of-the-interior) of the Vekllei [Home Islands](/utopia/vekllei/) and the [international governing body](/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#administration-of-the-commonwealth) of the Vekllei Commonwealth. This article serves as a handbook to all departments of the Vekllei Government, and will help clarify the structure and responsibilities of its subordinate ministries and secretariats. These centralised features guide the busy and anarchic Vekllei economies to produce a standard of living unlike anywhere else in the world, celebrating departmentalised, localised and democratic government in the 21st Century.

### Structure

What we know as the 'Vekllei Government' is portioned between several powerful state bodies, each representing the natural political concerns of the modern Vekllei state. These bodies are both autonomous and codependent, portioning the sovereignty and authority of the state across several governing organs of varying size and scope. These are, in order of sovereignty:

1. **The Crown of Vekllei** (also the *Crown Sovereign*, *Parliament of Spirits* and *Administration of the Crown* interchangeably), representing the rule of the Land Sovereign and its presence in the state.
2. **The Commonwealth Government** (also the *Parliament of the Commonwealth* and the *Administration of the Commonwealth* interchangeably), responsible for the maintenance, development and security of the Vekllei Commonwealth, including its territories.
3. **The Interior Government** (also the *Parliament of the Interior* and the *Administration of the Interior* interchangeably), responsible for the internal governance of Vekllei.

Under this arrangement, it is clear that the sovereignty of Vekllei and its Commonwealth members is somewhat obfuscated -- the Crown, Commonwealth and Interior administrations all share overlapping *de facto* control over the affairs of Vekllei territories. In addition, the word 'Vekllei,' commonly used to refer to the Vekllei Home Islands, is also used interchangeably to describe states beyond its geography. For example, the 'Vekllei Commonwealth' in fact refers to membership in the Crown, of which Vekllei is an equal member but does not otherwise, in principle, control as a legal metropole. The Kalina Islands, Kala, Demon and other full members of the Commonwealth are equal autonomous members, but nonetheless inherit the Vekllei name. 

In this state of affairs, Vekllei can refer to the powerful member-state in the North Atlantic, the Commonwealth it belongs to, or, indeed, the Crown Sovereign itself. Unfortunately for foreigners, its use is generally dependent on context.

{{< hint panel >}}
**Since most Vekllei people** catch a train each day, VNR is a uniquely intimate and treasured organ of the Vekllei state. It is somehow exempted from the public apathy and resentment of bureaucracy that targets other monopolies of the Vekllei state, and is routinely regarded as among the most beloved and appreciated "companies" in Vekllei.
{{< /hint >}}

The Government of Vekllei is made up of Ministries, Offices, Departments, Bureaus, Commissions, Directorates and Secretariats depending on the size, purpose and organisation of the organ. This is the government that people living in the Vekllei Home Islands vote for, via the nonpartisan representatives system.

---

## Administration of the Interior

The *Administration of the Interior of the Government of Vekllei* (also known as the *Interior Government* or *Interior Parliament*) represents the human state of the Vekllei Home Islands, as well as its dependent possessions. It includes all 100 [boroughs](/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/) of the Home Islands and its peripheral island possessions. Independent Commonwealth member-states Demon and Aismious lack the population to govern themselves independently, and so are dependent on the Interior Government.

The Interior Government is made up of 10 ministries.

### Ministry of Commerce 
{{<boxtag pink>}}COSMOSOL{{</boxtag>}}

The Vekllei *Ministry of Commerce* (COSMOSOL) regulates and initiates trade in the country. Despite the functional moneylessness of the Commonwealth, COSMOSOL remains among the busiest ministries of the Interior Government, since all economic policy, international trade and entitled renumeration (the Vekllei turn-of-phrase for withdrawing from the [Labour Bank](/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#bank-of-vekllei)) occurs through its subordinate commissions. Common responsibilities of COSMOSOL include:

* Regulation and taxation of international trade, particularly through Government 'White Bonds' and Labour Bank 'Blue Bonds'.
* Banking the Commonwealth state apparatus.
* Advising the Parliament on economic policy and foreign trade.
* Monitoring and reporting on the health of foreign markets.
* Printing and transporting currency.

Vekllei has a reputation as a financial capital for its political neutrality and location between Europe and the Americas, and is among the largest facilitators of international commerce and exchange in the world.

{{<section>}}
#### Bank of Vekllei

The *Labour Bank of Vekllei* (commonly "*Bank of Vekllei*") is the central bank and currency store of Vekllei. It is operated by the Ministry of Commerce and maintains branches in most major borough capitals in the Home Islands, as well as across all member states of the Vekllei Commonwealth. It is not autonomous and is beholden to the policy decisions of COSMOSOL and, in certain cases, the Interior and Commonwealth Parliaments. Its sworn purpose, as instructed by the Floral Constitution, is to advocate for Floral Economics.

The Bank of Vekllei was founded 1642 as the Royal Bank in [Lola](/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/lola/), and is the fifth oldest bank in the world.

Most banks in Vekllei are institutional or industrial, since the average Vekllei person is unmoneyed and, in a conventional definition, unbanked. Nonetheless, Vekllei maintains several commercial banks under the Bank of Vekllei umbrella, tasked primarily with:

* Cashing and underwriting White and Blue bonds.
* Selling government and financial (bureau) bonds internationally.
* International placement and borrowing services.
* Trading, settling and selling foreign currencies.

Vekllei citizens are entitled to an equal share of the money stored in the Labour Bank, and in certain circumstances may withdraw their balance to emigrate or travel abroad.

Despite foreign perception of Vekllei economics, the liquid and asset holdings of the Bank of Vekllei make it the second-largest bank in the world.

##### Commonwealth Bank of Vekllei

The *Commonwealth Bank of Vekllei* (COMMBANK) is an international investment subsidiary of the Bank of Vekllei, tasked primarily with banking in Commonwealth members and international markets. It has branches across every Commonwealth member-state and in most major economic hubs around the world, including throughout Europe, the Americas, and Asia. It also serves as the Central Bank of the Kalina Isles.

##### Import-Export Bank of Vekllei

The *Import-Export Bank of Vekllei* (VEKEXIM) is a state policy investment bank used to fund projects outside of the Commonwealth, particularly in developing countries. It is the primary investment mechanism of Vekllei foreign aid system, which uses export credits and low-interest bureau loans to build infrastructure overseas. It is among the most influential export banks in the world, and contributed to the Pan-African Railway and Hundred Dams projects as part of Vekllei's ongoing Trade Democracy economic scheme.

##### Development Bank of Vekllei

The *Development Bank of Vekllei* (DEVBANK) is a policy bank designed to organise and allocate funding for large-scale political projects, particularly in infrastructure. The Development Bank works as the engine of the Interior Government's policies, funded mostly with White Bonds issued internationally and labour-guaranteed certificates (a type of Blue Bond). It also creates loan arrangements, evaluates, and underwrites national government projects.

##### Petty Bureau Labour Bank of Vekllei

The *Petty Bureau Labour Bank of Vekllei* is the commercial lending bank of 'petty bureau' company syndicates and their workers. Its primary function is bureau negotiation and lending in order to facilitate the economic development of private business in Vekllei. It also acts as an intermediary between petty bureau companies and other banks or government financial apparatuses.

##### Bureau Proper Labour Bank of Vekllei

The *Bureau Proper Labour Bank of Vekllei* is the commercial lending bank of 'bureau proper' company syndicates and their workers. Similar to the *Petty Bureau Labour Bank*, it facilitates economic activity of bureaus and private industry primarily through asset management and mediation with the government and Bank of Vekllei.

#### National Mint of Vekllei
{{< hint >}}
❖ Read more: *[The Vekllei Crown](/posts/2020-06-24-crown/)*
{{< /hint >}}

The *National Mint of Vekllei* (also the *Mint*) is the sole producer of currency in Vekllei, tasked with minting and melting the Vekllei Crown. It also regulates gold bullion in the country, and manufactures bullion for use in the International Market. It is headquartered in Vekllei Proper, in the Home Islands.

The Mint is the custodian of the Commonwealth Bullion Depository, which holds reserves of over 6,000 tonnes of gold bullion belonging to the Commonwealth and over 60 other countries, among the largest such reserves in the world.

The Mint is well-regarded internationally for the purity of its metals and intricate commemorative coins, leading international numismatics in colour and variety.

{{<section>}}
#### Vekllei Securities Commission

The *Vekllei Securities Commission* (VECSEC) regulates securities in the Vekllei International Market. It advises fiscal decision-making to the Interior Parliament and legislates trade practices in the country, including the issuing and ownership of government bonds and bureau securities.

Since Vekllei citizens do not usually participate in the domestic securities markets, VECSEC lacks traditional legal authority over many of the foreign participants in its supervised markets, but does extradite and prosecute financial crime through the EUROVEK and USVEK extradition treaties. It is made up of the following departments.

* **General Council**: Advisory board to the Commonwealth.
* **General Procuratorate**: Enforcement of penalties and prosecution of financial crimes.
* **Department of Financing and Stock Exchange**: Regulation and monitoring of the Vekllei Stock Exchange and miscellaneous securities within the country.
* **Department of International Markets**: Regulation and monitoring of the Vekllei International Market and government bonds.
* **Department of Investments and Trusts**: Regulation and monitoring of the investments, securities and financial contracts of Vekllei citizens and companies.
{{</section>}}
{{<section>}}
#### Vekllei Trade Commission

The *Vekllei Trade Commission* regulates consumer protections and antitrust law, and organises trade information from other ministries and supervisory bureaus into policy recommendations and legislation. The Trade Commission also monitors and reports the health of foreign markets, and conducts research into broader geopolitical financial interests, particularly as they compete with domestic interests. It includes the following departments.

* **Department of Consumer Affairs**: Regulation of the consumer rights.
* **Department of Market Affairs**: Protection of fair markets and regulation of Bureau and Petty Bureau companies, including state monopolies.

Its primary responsibility is cooperation between member states and standardisation, and publishes reports and manuals towards this goal. It is also the primary ministry through which the parliaments and secretariats of the Commonwealth communicate with the Interior Government. COSMOCOM is also responsible for ensuring changes made to the Floral Constitution are implemented domestically.

#### Standardisations Directorate

The *Standardisations Directorate* (SSD, also Standards Vekllei) works to unify management and supervision of state bodies and assets in Vekllei. It also mandates the responsibilities and visual identity of all departments of the Government and boroughs of the Commonwealth, including the appearance and manuals of style of Commonwealth infrastructure and publications. Its work includes both operating procedures and major brand elements like flags and logos, and specific linguistic and typographic features including typefaces, preferred punctuation and symbols. It has considerable authority over other departments, which usually lack autonomy to enforce their own visual identity independently. Most visual work for the Standardisations Directorate is performed by in-house designers and artists.

The Standardisations Directorate also represents Vekllei in the International Organisation for Standardisation and other industrial standards bodies.

##### Standards Vekllei

The *General Office of the Standardisations Directorate* (GOSED), commonly *Standards Vekllei*, administrates the directorate, and determines its operations through direct liaison with the Interior and Commonwealth Administrations.

##### Standards Press of Vekllei

Publishing House organised vertically in the SSD to prepare and publish materials including technical manuals, standard compilation books, and industrial bulletins.

##### Industrial Standards of Vekllei

Insta is divided into sixteen technical committees that oversee particular industries.

##### Commercial Standards of Vekllei

The *Commercial Standards of Vekllei* (COMSTA) regulates standards of small and medium-sized commercial businesses that are otherwise 

Since private commerce in Vekllei exists outside of the bureau framework, the license of COMSTA are broader and flexible, and regularly relies upon contracted industry contacts to fill places on its less defined technical committees.

### Ministry of Defence 
{{<boxtag pink>}}COSMOKOS{{</boxtag>}}

The Vekllei *Ministry of Defence* (COSMOKOS) represents the Sovereign Armed Forces of the Vekllei Commonwealth in the Vekllei Government, which are consolidated under the Commonwealth Military Command. COSMOKOS does not exercise command authority over the armed forces of Vekllei, and serves instead as the ministerial liaison between the Commonwealth Military Command and the Interior Government. Common responsibilities of COSMOKOS include:

* Recruitment of citizens and foreigners into the Commonwealth armed forces.
* Procuring equipment to meet the Vekllei obligation towards the Commonwealth armed forces.
* Training citizens and foreigners for the branches of the Commonwealth armed forces.
* Conducting scientific military research.
* Policing and security of Vekllei territories and waters.

{{<section>}}
#### Armed Forces of Vekllei

The *Armed Forces of Vekllei*, arranged under the COSMOKOS ministry, are unusual in that they do not have control directly over troops or equipment. The actual armed forces of Vekllei, known as the [Royal](/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#royal-armed-forces-of-vekllei) or [Crown Armed Forces](/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#royal-armed-forces-of-vekllei), are a sovereign feature of the country and as such are placed under direct supervision of the Sovereign Administration -- seperate from the Vekllei and Commonwealth governments.

The purpose of the Armed Forces of Vekllei, an agency-level body under control of COSMOKOS, is to integrate the Crown Armed Forces with the interior government, and facilitate the employ of Vekllei people in the Armed Forces. 

##### Communications Bureau

The *Communications Bureau* is a bureau-level organisation of the Armed Forces responsible for coordinating public information about military activities.

##### Department of Compulsory Service

The *Department of Compulsory Service* (DoCS, also CS) oversees the Vekllei Compulsory Service Scheme, a hybrid civilian/military conscription law that requires four years from each citizen between the ages of 18 and 32. Despite reporting to the Armed Forces of COSMOKOS, the DoCS does not facilitate widespread conscription and mobilisation of the civilian population, a role served by the [DoM](/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#department-of-mobilisation). Instead, it is responsible primarily for supervising the fulfilment of the Compulsory Service Scheme, and administrating the conscription and training of Vekllei citizens, including in civilian and industrial roles.

##### Department of Foreign Affairs

The *Department of Foreign Affairs* (DoFA) coordinates military affairs with states overseas, including members of the Commonwealth.

* **Office of the Public**: Press office that prepares public announcements and controls information to the press.
* **Office of Overseas Affairs**: Flexible, reactive policy and long-term research objectives.
* **Office of Strategic Affairs**: Research that contributes to floral democracy, particularly as it operates at the borough and canton levels of government.

##### Department of Mobilisation

The *Department of Mobilisation* (DoM) is responsible for recruitment in peacetime, and conscription in the outbreak of war. In the Floral Period, Vekllei defensive doctrine aims to make the country "ungovernable," requiring widespread mobilisation and training of the civilian population. Unlike the [DoCS](/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#department-of-compulsory-service), the DoM is concerned primarily with the combat effectiveness of the mobilised population, and is generally distinguished in its strategic military thinking.

##### Department of Peacekeeping

The *Department of Peacekeeping* (DoP) coordinates Vekllei's overseas peacekeeping operations. Vekllei is among the largest contributors of men and equipment towards United Nations Peacekeeping Forces, which 

##### Intelligence Liaison

The *Intelligence Liaison* is a specialised office that coordinates military intelligence between Vekllei's security apparatuses, particularly those of the [National Intelligence Directorate](/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#national-intelligence-directorate). Intelligence gathering in Vekllei is performed by a variety of mostly autonomous espionage organs, and the purpose of the Liaison is to authenticate and prepare intelligence for military use. It includes the following branches.

* **National Intelligence Branch**: Coordination of intelligence gathered by security apparatuses with Armed Forces.
* **Civilian Intelligence Branch**: Coordination of intelligence gathered by industrial and civilian sectors (in occupied territories, for example) with Armed Forces and security apparatuses.
* **Strategic Intelligence Branch**: Coordination of intelligence gathered by the Armed Forces with security apparatuses.

##### Sovereign Liaison

The *Sovereign Liaison* is a specialised office intended to link the [Royal Armed Forces of Vekllei](/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#royal-armed-forces-of-vekllei) with COSMOKOS, an interior ministry with no direct control over troops of the Crown. Although it is the *de facto* office of communication with the Crown forces, in practice communication generally occurs directly with the relevant COSMOKOS department. The purpose of the Sovereign Liaison is mostly as a democracy-advocate, supervising the COSMOKOS departments as an anti-corruption watchdog similar to other democracy-advocates. It also ensures COSMOKOS operations do not affect sovereign operations

{{</section>}}

{{<section>}}
#### Police of the Parliament

The *Police of the Parliament* (VENOPOR) are the national and paramilitary police of Vekllei, responsible for internal security, riot control, counter-terrorism, disaster response, law enforcement and maritime rights protection. The VENOPOR is made up of a variety of organisations dedicated to specialised and tactical forms of policing unavailable to the [Police of the Public](/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#police-of-the-public). As a paramilitary force, the VENOPOR are also trained to support the [Crown Armed Forces](/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#royal-armed-forces-of-vekllei) in wartime, and coordinate broad mobilisation in the event of a defensive war.

The VENOPOR is

#### Vekllei Electric Commission

The *Vekllei Electric Commission* (VEC, also Thunderburo) is responsible for the state monopoly on electricity generation in Vekllei. Although the VEC is structured as a bureau company, its subsidiaries are state-owned and consequently operates similarly to other agency-level departments of the Interior Government. The VEC consists of multiple subcommissions dedicated to unique types of electricity generation in Vekllei, primarily through hydro-electric, geothermal and nuclear methods.

##### Magma-Electric Commission

The Vekllei *Magma-Electric Commission* (colloquially *The Magma*) oversees geothermal electricity production in Vekllei. Because of Vekllei's location over the rift of the European and American continental plates, widespread geothermal electricity production is widespread and makes up the majority of commercial and domestic electricity consumption in Vekllei.

##### Hydro-Electric Commission

The Vekllei *Hydro-Electric Commission* (colloquially *The Hydro*, not to be confused with the [*Hydroburo*](/utopia/vekllei/society/government/#vekllei-water-commission)) oversees hydro-electric electricity generation in Vekllei, particularly in the glacial regions of the Home Islands and Kala.

## Administration of the Commonwealth

Although each member of the Atlantic Commonwealth is considered a full participant of equal importance, administration in practice occurs in the Vekllei [Home Islands](/utopia/vekllei/), its most populous and industrious member state. Many features of Floral Society are universal among Commonwealth members, and the Administration of the Commonwealth serves, maintains and standardises the values of Floral Society across the Atlantic.

### Commonwealth Culture Secretariat 
{{<boxtag pink>}}COLSEC{{</boxtag>}}

The *Commonwealth Culture Secretariat* (COLSEC) is concerned primarily with 'cultural values and beliefs' of the Commonwealth, their protection, and foreign relations. Its subordinate offices are dedicated to key areas of concern designed to assist its smaller member-states which may lack the political infrastructure to facilitate their own offices. 

{{<section>}}
#### Commonwealth Affairs Office

The COLSEC *Commonwealth Affairs Office* (COLSA) is responsible for the documentation of the general disposition, welfare, culture and demography of the people of the Commonwealth. This includes political attitudes towards the Commonwealth itself, as well as how decisions made by other Secretariats impact public opinion. It is also the body-advocate of the public of member states who are unable to appeal to their local government directly.

##### Religious Affairs Office

The COLSEC *Religious Affairs Office* (COLSERE) is responsible for reporting religious trends across the Commonwealth, particularly as they intersect with religious infrastructure (places of worship and natural shrines) and organised religion. Its focus is mostly external, since the *Upen*'s animism in the Home Islands lacks conventional religious hierarchies. COLSERE also serves as an advisory body to COLSEC command and as reporting agency for discrimination and concerns of faith.

##### Veteran Affairs Office

The COLSEC *Veteran Affairs Office* (COLVET) is responsible for organising healthcare, housing and support for all former members of the Commonwealth Armed Forces. It also serves as an advocacy body for veterans themselves, especially in arguing for material support from other departments within the government. COLVET is also responsible for formulating and advising policy on veteran affairs to Commonwealth and Interior Parliaments.

##### Civil Affairs Office

The COLSEC *Civil Affairs Office* (COLSECA) is responsible for the health of the government of its member states and the maintenance of COLSEC guidelines on Floral Society. It serves as a political school for Floral politics and as the support mechanism for natural disasters, public unrest and other threats to the stability of its member states. 

##### Cultural Heritage Affairs Office

The COLSEC Cultural Heritage Affairs Office (COLSEHE)

##### Overseas Affairs Office

The COLSEC Overseas Affairs Office (COLSESEA) coordinates the foreign offices of the Commonwealth, particularly for states that lack their own foreign affairs offices in [Kalina](/utopia/vekllei/landscape/territories/kalina) and the [West Antilles](/utopia/vekllei/landscape/territories/west). It also serves as an advisory board for policy and trade with other countries, particularly as they interact with autonomous states.
