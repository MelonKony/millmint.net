## Overview

**The borough of Pharos** is an administrative region in the south-west of Vekllei, located in the Capital Region on the Coast of the Americas, north of [Mumen](/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/mumen/) and west of Lola.

>*These were pleasant, poor boroughs of the Capital lighted by all corners of the world. They are also strikingly diverse in landscape — West Uclo is mostly pre-war, filled with low-rise Junta-era row houses and coffee shops. East Uclo contains some of Vekllei’s rare “towers in the park” — vertical neighbourhoods in the sky.*

## Etymology

Pharos was originally called Asmelola (lit. Southern Oslola) by its Algic inhabitants and for most of its history under the Middle and early Late Periods of Vekllei, but was renamed in the early 20th Century after the Pharos of Alexandria, an Egyptian lighthouse and ancient wonder, in an immodest declaration of the emerging Atlantic port's importance as a bridge between the Old World and the Americas. Its origins as a candidate for the Asmelola area coincided by the ambitious plans to construct a deepwater port on the Coast of the Americas. The name was retained after the Vekllei defeat in the First Atomic War and into the Floral Period today.
