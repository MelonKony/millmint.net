>*Gigayeh had beautiful empty beaches, littered with icebergs that caught the light like jewels, but Tzipora couldn’t swim and the water was freezing. They could have enjoyed café food in the sun, but Cobian’s regimented home life had left her incapable of eating outside of her designated meals, and Tzipora could only drink so much coffee. Instead, most of these afternoons, they found themselves sitting on the ocean promenade, watching a handful of locals go about their business as they counted the minutes.*

<span class="fc">T</span>
**he borough of Mirah** is an administrative region on the west coast of Vekllei, located east of Tohs and south of Geame. It is named after Mirah, its largest population centre and fishing town dependent largely on deepwater trawling in the Vekllei Sea. It is also home to the Vekllei International Casino, a hotel and resort available only to foreigners, which resides in the town of Gigayeh.

## History

Mirah is among several boroughs on Vekllei's West Coast settled thousands of years ago by Aleutian peoples, and many residents of Mirah have family histories that trace back hundreds of years. In 1924, the Mirah Port opened to welcome fishing traffic returning from deep Atlantic waters and Greenland. In 2026, the International Casino opened in Gigayeh, to bolster tourism on the West Coast and relieve pressure on overburdened tourist facilities in the Capital Region.

## Geography

Mirah is considered a satellite borough to the Capital Region, but formally lies in the Coastal Ro Highlands. It is abundant with seabirds, cold-weather mosses and drumlin fields. The famous white Siyaiousinesm Cliffs are also found nearby.
