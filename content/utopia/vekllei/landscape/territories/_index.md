## Overview

The word *Vekllei* here refers to the Vekllei Commonwealth, which is a supernational association of independent states that includes the [Home Island](/utopia/vekllei) and its dependent territories as well as sovereign, independent member-states like Kalina and Aismious.

1. **Crown Lakes**, or *Kronaislagaisdelfia*, are governmental territories of human concern, analogous to public land or federal territory overseas.
2. **Crown Land**, or *Kronaismioudelfia*, are nongovernmental territories of natural reservation. Although similar in some ways to nature reserves or national parks, their legal status in Vekllei is somewhat more complex; although *de facto* part of the country, the government does not recognise human sovereignty over these regions, a feature inherited from [Upen](/utopia/vekllei/religion).
3. **Boroughs**, or *Baras*, are administrative regions in Vekllei named for their largest population centres. They form the basic subdivision of Vekllei territory and also constitute voting regions in the electoral system.
4. **Provinces**, or *Piousvincinia*, are the territories in Vekllei's possession outside of the Home Islands. Most notably these include *Kala* (Greenland), the *Aismious Islands* (Faroe Islands), the *Kalina Isles* and the *Azores*. As inhabited provinces, both *Kala* and the *Azores* are considered semiautonomous territories, under purview of the *Kala People's Assembly* and the *Azores Holiday Government* respectively. The *Aismious* province and various other territories are considered *Crown Lakes*. Vekllei also retains over a hundred satellite islands and islets, most as *Crown Lands*.
