## Overview

{{<hint panel>}}
**Welcome to Vekllei.** This article introduces the essential setting of this website -- the Commonwealth of Vekllei. This is how it works, and how its people live. Welcome to the epilogue of the [*epoch of rest*](/intro/faq/#why-utopia).
{{</hint>}}

**Vekllei** is best conceptualised as a union of islands across the Atlantic Ocean. This commonwealth, the fourth in a series, consists of many island republics that are connected by politics and prosperity, not geography or race. These islands range in size from the Selvas Islands of 160 people to the island of Oslola, of 14 million. Together, they amount to a single superstate that spans the entirety of the Atlantic as a great power.

The Commonwealth which unites them is highly centralised and built on common systems of governance and economic management. Members of this commonwealth cede aspects of governance like security, health and education to the Commonwealth. The country is colloquially known as *Vekllei*, an Algic *corcidi* word meaning *people of the sea and stars*.[^vekllei]

The capital of Vekllei is [Comet](/comet/), located west of the Azores Commonwealth in the Meteor Islands.

Vekllei is often regarded a nation by will, rather than of culture or geography. It consists of distant autonomous republics with many cultures and languages, and it has attracted millions of immigrants since independence looking to participate in building the unique aspects of its governance and society.

> Oslola, raging and now blinded, drew deep wounds into the Earth. Out of these wounds came fire, and out of fire came Vekllei.

-- Retelling of Algic legends, Verse 40, *Saga of Origins*

{{< details title="What is Vekllei?" open=false >}}
The Vekllei Commonwealth is a country that consists of many island republics in the Atlantic. The largest of these is called the *Vekllei Islands*, which is its most populous constituent. The Commonwealth is the setting of this fiction, and is the home of most of its characters.

{{< details title="Where is Vekllei?" open=false >}}
The Vekllei Commonwealth consists of many islands across the Atlantic oceans, but most of its constituent nations are found in the North Atlantic and Caribbean seas. Its northernmost territory is Helvasia (Svalbard) and its southernmost territories are on the Antarctic continent.

{{< details title="When was the Vekllei Commonwealth founded?" open=false >}}
The Vekllei Commonwealth of Oceans is the 4th in a succession of historic Commonwealths based in the Kalan and Vekllei Islands. The first, known as the Nord Commonwealth, was the world's first parliament and among the first democracies in the world.

## Society

Opinionated foreign policy

Immigration requires the adoption of Vekllei beliefs, values and behaviours, rooted in political ambitions of independence and the 4th Floral Commonwealth. Immigration is closely controlled and migrants are integrated into diverse neighbourhoods to minimise monocultural enclaves. The accession to the Commonwealth of Caribbean nations has also seen migration between Vekllei North Atlantic territories and the Caribbean.

Armed Neutrality

## State

The Vekllei Commonwealth is a federated superstate including [six individual commonwealths](/utopia/vekllei/#commonwealth-member-states) which share political features modelled after the Vekllei Islands. Sovereignty is afforded to the territory of Vekllei through an indigenous land-metaphysic called the **Crown Sovereign**. The physical representative of the Crown Sovereign, an intangible metaphysical constant, is called the [Palace of the Vekllei Commonwealth](/crown/), which enshrines the floral constitution and retains control over the armed forces.

{{</hint>}}

The Vekllei government plays an active role in the lives of ordinary people. Each commonwealth republic is represented by two people[^ministers] of equal standing called Prime Ministers. These ministers represent the bicameral parliaments and assembled cabinets of their homes, and participate equally in a council of leaders called the Commonwealth Directory.

There are different levels of elected government in Vekllei.

1. The *Vekllei Commonwealth* is the supranational governing body and federal parliament of its constituents. 
2. The *National Commonwealths* are smaller governments located regionally that manage home affairs.
  * The **Crown Senate**, or the upper house, is made up 100 senators with special powers to approve and appeal legislation.
  * The **Crown Assembly**, or the lower house, is made up of 200 regional ministers.
3. The *Municipal Commonwealths* are local administrative areas or boroughs that manage local services.

Vekllei elections do not allow political parties, a system called *nonpartisan democracy*. Ministers from the

The Vekllei Government plays an active part in the lives of ordinary people. They are represented by a bicameral house system, including a parliament of nonpartisan representatives and a cabinet appointed by the Prime Minister's office.

Vekllei has [two prime ministers](/stories/ministers/)

People in Vekllei are governed by several organisations, including local [municipalities](/municipalities/), their [national governments](/interior/), the [Commonwealth](/commonwealth/), and the [Palace of the Atlantic Crown](/crown/).

Beneath the Palace is the **Commonwealth Parliament**, which manages affairs that concern all commonwealth member-states, including standardisation of education, protection of culture, and intelligence gathering. The Commonwealth Parliament unites the resources of individual **Island Commonwealths** (called Islands here for simplicity), and standardises their political features. Island Commonwealths may have their own sovereign member-states, as in the case of Kalina and Antilles. These small nation-states are called **Cherishes** and retain their own parliamentary governments.

In total, there are four national governments sharing overlapping sovereignty over individual Vekllei countries. Together, they form a tremendous superstate with control over most of the Atlantic.

1. **The Crown** -- the physical nature of territory belonging to the Vekllei Commonwealth, represented in human affairs by the Palace
2. **The Commonwealth Parliament** -- the highest human multinational parliament and elected cabinet
3. **The Island Parliaments** -- self-managing regional governments, functionally similar to traditional nation-states

And, in the case of Cherishes, which are individual republics within island commonwealths:

4. **The National Parliaments** -- local, traditionally republican governments that have further concessions to boroughs, councils, municipalities and villages

Constituent member-states of the Commonwealth (the 'Island Parliaments') have two prime ministers that represent their national governments in the Commonwealth parliament. In most Islands, prime ministers include one man and one woman, with the exception of Kala. Elections are conducted with a Hare-Clark single transferable vote system to elect the prime ministers and bicameral legislatures, usually consisting of an upper house (a *Crown Secretariat*) and a lower house (*Assembly*). All voting in Vekllei is participatory and the superstate does not enforce a poll tax at any level of government. However, Island Parliaments require electoral enrolment from age 16 onwards.

Since Vekllei governments are nonpartisan, they do not allow formal participation of parties within elections. Despite this, informal associations of elected representatives exist, in the form of *sociopartit*, or *Party Associations*. The largest of these include the Vekllei Industrial Working Concern, the Atlantic Party, and the Crown, and although membership is permitted among elected members they are otherwise disallowed within the electoral process.

Governance in almost all levels of Vekllei government can be arranged along three branches, which scale from small village municipalities to the very Crown itself.

* **A Parliament**, including bicameral houses, petty legislatures, municipalities and the Palace.
* **A Government**, including prime ministers and an elected ministerial cabinet.
* **A Judiciary**, including both the High Court and Constitutional Court of Vekllei as well as tiny petty magistratures and council courts

### Economy
{{< hint panel >}}
The principle of the Vekllei is liberty in the context of a moneyless system.

{{< hint >}}
✿ See also: *[On Moneylessness](/news/essays/moneylessness/)*
{{</hint>}}

The Commonwealth has a hybrid moneyless system called *commons*, in which money is not used in daily life. In the place of money, the commons system exists as a series of social economies and usufructs. Rather than purchasing products as consumers, staples like food and clothing are subsidised by groups of companies known as [*bureaus*](/bureaus/). Everything else is produced in the colloquial moneyless market, often unreliably.

Money is used in a seperate industrial and financial market called the *financialised commons*. In this market, Vekllei uses two currencies known as [*Vekllei*](/utopia/society/state/finance/#vekllei-crown-vk) and [*Government Crowns*](/utopia/society/state/finance/#government-crown-ak), used by the government, industry and foreigners to interact with the Vekllei economy and purchase securities and financial instruments. Money is also used as a means of exchange between Commonwealth republics as a privilege of the state.

The commons economy relies on a system of participatory work, encouraged by the simple and universal rule to be employed, called [Consosva](/consosva/). The standard of living in Vekllei is quite good and is unique among modern societies today.

#### Finance

{{<hint>}}
✿ Main article: <span class="smallicon">💵</span> *[Finance in Vekllei](/finance/)*
{{</hint>}}

Vekllei separates its markets to allow for money to be used by industry and the government as part of trade and business.

* **The Commons** is the moneyless and participatory domestic market.
* **The Financialised Commons** are the moneyed industrial and international markets.


Most Vekllei people never interact with the financialised commons, but it plays a significant role in the global economy. Vekllei's extended history as an entrepôt and its international neutrality have made it desirable as a place of business and investment, and many foreign companies bank in Vekllei. The Commonwealth is a major commodities and securities exchange, via the Vekllei International Market.

Despite its international investment and freedom, the Commonwealth government is a major participant in the financialised commons and contributes significantly to its currency pool. Vekllei has the second-largest foreign currency reserves in the world.

Vekllei culture and ideology values property ownership. Ownership in Vekllei is primarily a social function legalised by the delicture system.

### Education

✿ Main article: <span class="smallicon">📚</span> *[Education in Vekllei](/education/)*
{{</hint>}}

Education in Vekllei is universal and compulsory for children until the age of 16. All schools are coeducational, with the exception of a handful of [faith schools](/utopia/society/state/education/#faith-schools).

[^vekllei]: The *corcodi* is actually a combination of two poetic phrases, and is usually transliterated seperately as *people of the sea, people of the stars*, though the meaning is the same.
[^ministers]: In all Commonwealths except for Kala, the prime ministers are required to be one man and one woman.
