## Overview

{{< hint >}}
ﬂ∑ This article is about [Vekllei](/intro/#what-is-vekllei)
{{</hint>}}

{{< hint panel >}}
**Computers** are used to subsidise rather than multiply productivity in Vekllei. This does not mean that they do not make commerce or industry more efficient, or open new means of communication between people -- only that they are understood foremost as a social benefit that enables the more idealistic features of the Floral Period and its functional moneylessness. Vekllei is working towards participatory work, and computers are among the dream's most valuable means in which it is being realised.
{{</hint>}}

People in Vekllei value home-ownership and property stewardship.
