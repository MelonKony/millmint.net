### Vekllei Electric Commission

The *Vekllei Electric Commission* (VEC, also Thunderburo) is responsible for the state monopoly on electricity generation in Vekllei. Although the VEC is structured as a bureau company, its subsidiaries are state-owned and consequently operates similarly to other agency-level departments of the Interior Government. The VEC consists of multiple subcommissions dedicated to unique types of electricity generation in Vekllei, primarily through hydro-electric, geothermal and nuclear methods.

#### Magma-Electric Commission

The Vekllei *Magma-Electric Commission* (colloquially *The Magma*) oversees geothermal electricity production in Vekllei. Because of Vekllei's location over the rift of the European and American continental plates, widespread geothermal electricity production is widespread and makes up the majority of commercial and domestic electricity consumption in Vekllei.

#### Hydro-Electric Commission

The Vekllei *Hydro-Electric Commission* (colloquially *The Hydro*, not to be confused with the [*Hydroburo*](/utopia/society/government/#vekllei-water-commission)) oversees hydro-electric electricity generation in Vekllei, particularly in the glacial regions of the Home Islands and Kala. 

#### Nuclear-Electric Commission

The Vekllei *Nuclear-Electric Commission* (also *Atomic Vekllei* or NEC) oversees nuclear electricity generation in Vekllei.

### Emergency Light and Water Authority

The *Emergency Light and Water Authority* (EVA) is a specialised department of the Ministry of Light and Water designed to mitigate interruption to electricity and water supply. Its mandate includes the security of utility infrastructure and disaster preparation. In the event of major interruption to the utilities supervised by the Ministry, the EVA would assume direct control of the Hydro and Thunderburos and coordinate their recovery. Threats include both natural disasters like volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, as well as damage from conventional or nuclear war.
