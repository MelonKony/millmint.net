## Overview
{{<boxtag teal>}}COSMOLA{{</boxtag>}}

The *Ministry of Light & Water* (COSMOLA) is responsible for the government monopoly on water and energy in Vekllei. Through its statutory corporations (SCs) and public utilities, the ministry is responsible for the vast majority of energy production in the Vekllei Islands and contributes significantly to energy research through its network of  laboratories. Increasingly, COSMOLA investment has indicated an interest in energy and water conservation. Common responsibilities of COSMOLA include:

* Maintenance and operation of utilities that provide Vekllei people with electricity and water.
* Production and conservation of energy and water.
* Investment and research into emerging physical sciences.
* Advising energy and water policy to the [Interior Parliament](/utopia/society/state/government/interior).
* Nuclear energy security.

COSMOLA is the third-largest ministry by persons employed, and its sub-agencies and SCs are responsible for a number of iconic pieces of Vekllei infrastructure, including the [Expo '74 Experimental Reactor](/posts/2019-09-15-reactor/) and the [Ou Hydroburo Complex](/posts/2020-04-21-hydro/).

### Vekllei Electric Commission

The *Vekllei Electric Commission* (VEC, also Thunderburo) is responsible for the state monopoly on electricity generation in Vekllei. Although the VEC is structured as a bureau company, its subsidiaries are state-owned and consequently operates similarly to other agency-level departments of the [Interior Parliament](/utopia/society/state/government/interior). The VEC consists of multiple subcommissions dedicated to unique types of electricity generation in Vekllei, primarily through hydro-electric, geothermal and nuclear methods.

#### Magma-Electric Commission

The Vekllei *Magma-Electric Commission* (colloquially *The Magma* or MEC) oversees geothermal electricity production in Vekllei. Because of Vekllei's location over the rift of the European and American continental plates, widespread geothermal electricity production is widespread and makes up the majority of commercial and domestic electricity consumption in Vekllei. Forty-six MEC plants of varying sizes supply clean renewable energy to Vekllei households, and waste heat is used to heat greenhouses Vekllei depends on for food production.

#### Hydro-Electric Commission

The Vekllei *Hydro-Electric Commission* (colloquially *The Hydro*, not to be confused with the [*Hydroburo*](#vekllei-water-commission)) oversees hydro-electric electricity generation in Vekllei, particularly in the glacial regions of the Vekllei Islands and Kala. Dramatic mountain terrain in the interior of the Vekllei Islands proved suitable candidates for hydro-electric dams, which were mostly constructed in the pre-war and immediate post-war era. Vekllei's oldest dam in [Ou](/utopia/landscape/boroughs/ou/) has been operating continuously for 156 years.

#### Nuclear-Electric Commission

The Vekllei *Nuclear-Electric Commission* (also *Atomic Vekllei* or NEC) oversees nuclear electricity generation in Vekllei. Nuclear energy has proliferated in postwar Vekllei, and satisfies the Commonwealth's growing industrial power demands. Most commercial nuclear plants in Vekllei use uranium-233 reactor fuels, processed mostly at the National Centrifuge & Enrichment Plant in Speidisn. Vekllei reactors mostly of a molten salt type. The NEC maintains 56 plants in total across the Commonwealth, most of which are located in the Vekllei Islands or Kala.

### Vekllei Water Commission

The *Vekllei Water Commission* (Hydroburo) is responsible for providing potable drinking water, wastewater and stormwater services to the Vekllei Islands and most Commonwealth members. Water in Vekllei is universal and of good quality. The Hydroburo also maintains offices for sewerage, conservation, and construction.

In the Vekllei Islands and Kala, most drinking water comes from fresh glacial runoff that requires minimal treating. Industrial water consumption is provided by nuclear desalination plants operated by the Hydroburo.

### Emergency Light and Water Authority

The *Emergency Light and Water Authority* (EVA) is a specialised department of the Ministry of Light and Water designed to mitigate interruption to electricity and water supply. Its mandate includes the security of utility infrastructure and disaster preparation. In the event of major interruption to the utilities supervised by the Ministry, the EVA would assume direct control of the Hydro and Thunderburos and coordinate their recovery. Threats include both natural disasters like volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, as well as damage from conventional or nuclear war.
