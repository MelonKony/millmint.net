## Overview
{{<boxtag teal>}}COSMOSOL{{</boxtag>}}

The Vekllei *Ministry of Commerce* (COSMOSOL) regulates and initiates trade in the country. Despite the functional moneylessness of the Commonwealth, COSMOSOL remains among the busiest ministries of the Interior Government, since all economic policy, international trade and entitled renumeration (the Vekllei turn-of-phrase for withdrawing from the [Labour Bank](#bank-of-vekllei)) occurs through its subordinate commissions. Common responsibilities of COSMOSOL include:

* Regulation and taxation of international trade, particularly through Government '[White Bonds](/utopia/society/state/finance/?ref=footer#white-bonds)' and Labour Bank '[Blue Bonds](/utopia/society/state/finance/?ref=footer#blue-bonds)'.
* Banking the Commonwealth state apparatus.
* Advising the Parliament on economic policy and foreign trade.
* Monitoring and reporting on the health of foreign markets.
* Printing and transporting currency.

Vekllei has a reputation as a financial capital for its political neutrality and location between Europe and the Americas, and is among the largest facilitators of international commerce and exchange in the world.

### Bank of Vekllei

The *Labour Bank of Vekllei* (commonly "*Bank of Vekllei*") is the central bank and currency store of Vekllei. It is operated by the Ministry of Commerce and maintains branches in most major borough capitals in the Home Islands, as well as across all member states of the Vekllei Commonwealth. It is not autonomous and is beholden to the policy decisions of COSMOSOL and, in certain cases, the Interior and Commonwealth Parliaments. Its sworn purpose, as instructed by the Floral Constitution, is to advocate for Floral Economics.

The Bank of Vekllei was founded 1642 as the Royal Bank in [Lola](/utopia/landscape/boroughs/lola/), and is the fifth oldest bank in the world.

Most banks in Vekllei are institutional or industrial, since the average Vekllei person is unmoneyed and, in a conventional definition, unbanked. Nonetheless, Vekllei maintains several commercial banks under the Bank of Vekllei umbrella, tasked primarily with:

* Cashing and underwriting White and Blue bonds.
* Selling government and financial (bureau) bonds internationally.
* International placement and borrowing services.
* Trading, settling and selling foreign currencies.

Vekllei citizens are entitled to an equal share of the money stored in the Labour Bank, and in certain circumstances may withdraw their balance to emigrate or travel abroad.

Despite foreign perception of Vekllei economics, the liquid and asset holdings of the Bank of Vekllei make it the second-largest bank in the world.

#### Commonwealth Bank of Vekllei

The *Commonwealth Bank of Vekllei* (COMMBANK) is an international investment subsidiary of the Bank of Vekllei, tasked primarily with banking in Commonwealth members and international markets. It has branches across every Commonwealth member-state and in most major economic hubs around the world, including throughout Europe, the Americas, and Asia. It also serves as the Central Bank of the Kalina Isles.

#### Import-Export Bank of Vekllei

The *Import-Export Bank of Vekllei* (VEKEXIM) is a state policy investment bank used to fund projects outside of the Commonwealth, particularly in developing countries. It is the primary investment mechanism of Vekllei foreign aid system, which uses export credits and low-interest bureau loans to build infrastructure overseas. It is among the most influential export banks in the world, and contributed to the Pan-African Railway and Hundred Dams projects as part of Vekllei's ongoing Trade Democracy economic scheme.

#### Development Bank of Vekllei

The *Development Bank of Vekllei* (DEVBANK) is a policy bank designed to organise and allocate funding for large-scale political projects, particularly in infrastructure. The Development Bank works as the engine of the Interior Government's policies, funded mostly with White Bonds issued internationally and labour-guaranteed certificates (a type of Blue Bond). It also creates loan arrangements, evaluates, and underwrites national government projects.

#### Petty Bureau Labour Bank of Vekllei

The *Petty Bureau Labour Bank of Vekllei* (SISTERBANK) is the commercial lending bank of 'petty bureau' company syndicates and their workers. Its primary function is bureau negotiation and lending in order to facilitate the economic development of private business in Vekllei. It also acts as an intermediary between petty bureau companies and other banks or government financial apparatuses.

Sisterbank is the primary mechanism by which private business is done in Vekllei, facilitating loans, placement and logistics for small to medium-sized businesses.

#### Bureau Proper Labour Bank of Vekllei

The *Bureau Proper Labour Bank of Vekllei* (MOTHERBANK) is the commercial lending bank of 'bureau proper' company syndicates and their workers. Similar to the Sisterbank, it facilitates economic activity of bureaus and private industry primarily through asset management and mediation with the government and Bank of Vekllei.

### Vekllei Securities Commission

The *Vekllei Securities Commission* (VECSEC) regulates securities in the Vekllei International Market. It advises fiscal decision-making to the Interior Parliament and legislates trade practices in the country, including the issuing and ownership of government bonds and bureau securities.

Since Vekllei citizens do not usually participate in the domestic securities markets, VECSEC lacks traditional legal authority over many of the foreign participants in its supervised markets, but does extradite and prosecute financial crime through the EUROVEK and USVEK extradition treaties. It includes the following departments.

* **General Council**: Advisory board to the Commonwealth.
* **General Procuratorate**: Enforcement of penalties and prosecution of financial crimes.
* **General Inspectorate**: Investigations into fraud, abuse and corruption in Vekllei markets.
