## Overview
{{<boxtag teal>}}COSMOCOM{{</boxtag>}}

The *Ministry of the Commonwealth* (COSMOCOM) is the organ through which the Interior Parliament communicates and cooperates with the Commonwealth Parliament and its secretariats. Its primary responsibility is cooperation between member states and standardisation, and publishes reports and manuals towards this goal. It is also the primary ministry through which the subordinates of the Commonwealth influence the Interior Parliament. COSMOCOM is also responsible for ensuring changes made to the Floral Constitution are implemented domestically. Common responsibilities of COSMOCOM include:

* Advising, training and auditing local accreditation and qualifications in line with Commonwealth standards and directives.
* Ensuring that the Vekllei interior state meets standards determined by the Commonwealth parliaments and international commitments.
* Developing and enforcing standards in technical, industrial and brand features of the Interior Government and its responsible state assets and bureau partners.
* Training and maintaining the workforce for the Interior civil service and Interior state assets in line with Commonwealth standards and directives.

COSMOCOM's commitments to the transnational Commonwealth Parliaments go both ways -- the ministry ensures domestic compliance and also advises Commonwealth policy and standards, since the Vekllei Interior Government is the largest and most industrious member-state of the Commonwealth.

### Accreditation Directorate

The *Accreditation Directorate* (also *Qualifications Vekllei* or VAD) is a transnational auditor of industrial, commercial and academic qualifications in Vekllei. VAD also develops technical and procedural standards for its responsible commercial and industrial partners. VAD also interfaces directly with international standards organisations on behalf of its subordinate auditors.

Standards in education for teachers and staff are generally developed and audited by the [Commonwealth Education Secretariat](/utopia/society/government/#commonwealth-education-secretariat).

VDA also maintains a catalogue of products and technical manuals available to industry partners, and enforces compliance for industrial and commercial standards through its subordinate inspectorate.

The Accreditation Directorate also represents Vekllei in the International Organisation for Standardisation and other industrial standards bodies.

#### Vekllei Qualifications Commission

The *Vekllei Qualifications Commission* (ADQC) is the primary research organ of the VAD, and develops most of the qualifications standards and procedure policies of government ministries and state assets. Its research is primarily commercial and industrial, since civil service qualifications are generally developed by the [Standardisations Directorate](/utopia/society/government/#standardisations-directorate).

#### Vekllei Industrial Audit Committee

The *Vekllei Industrial Audit Committee* (ADIA) is the primary audit and survey body of heavy and chemical industries, and is made up of representatives and technical representatives from its responsible industries. The Industrial Audit Committee also conducts most industrial audits, escalating breaches to the [Inspectorate](/utopia/society/government/#inspectorate-vekllei) only where criminal prosecution is required.

#### Vekllei Commons Audit Committee

The *Vekllei Commons Audit Committee* (ADCA) is the primary audit and survey body of commercial organisations and laboratories. Like [VADIAC](/utopia/society/government/#vekllei-industrial-audit-committee), the Commons Audi Committee is a civilian auditor made up of industry representatives and forwards criminal breaches towards the [Inspectorate](/utopia/society/government/#inspectorate-vekllei).

#### Inspectorate Vekllei

The *Vekllei Inspectorate* surveys and audits technical standards in business, research and industry for the Interior Parliament as the law-enforcement arm of the Accreditation Directorate. Breaches of Commonwealth standards are generally prosecuted in the Commonwealth Courts by the [INSTA](/utopia/society/government/#industrial-standards-of-vekllei) and [COMSTA](/utopia/society/government/#commercial-standards-of-vekllei) arms of [Standards Vekllei](/utopia/society/government/#standardisations-directorate). 

The Inspectorate acts an appeals board for civil breaches of VAD technical standards. It includes the following groups.

* **Survey and Testing Group**: Superior investigative outfit designed to investigate breaches of technical standards.
* **Industrial and Laboratory Safety Group**: Specialised health and safety compliance investigation.
* **Legal Group**: Legal advisory office for prosecuting domestic breaches and preparing reports for Commonwealth prosecution.

### Civil Service Academy of Vekllei

The *Civil Service Academy* (CSA) is a training school for middle and senior civil servants and interior policy researchers. Located in the borough of Callaisn in the Home Islands, it primarily trains servants of the domestic government apparatuses, and provides tertiary courses in governance and management related to its primary disciplines. The CSA also trains directors of key state assets, and provides education resources for bureau industry.

Most Vekllei nationals in Commonwealth offices are also trained at the CSA, which has sister offices in most independent Commonwealth member-states.

### Research Directorate

The *Research Directorate* conducts research and prepares policy objectives for use in Commonwealth governance, and determines the curriculum of the [CSA](/utopia/society/government/#civil-service-academy-of-vekllei) and other civil service training organisations.

* **Department of General Research**: Flexible, reactive policy and long-term research objectives.
* **Department of Stability**: Reactive and timely analysis of current affairs and events threatening the mandate and stability of the Commonwealth.
* **Department of Democracy**: Research that contributes to floral democracy, particularly as it operates at the borough and canton levels of government.
* **Department of Civil Affairs**: Research related to civil rights, demography and culture policy.
* **Department of Commonwealth Economics and Trade**: Macroeconomic research in Commonwealth trade.
* **Department of Reform**: Research related to Vekllei bureaucracy and the efficiency of its government.

### Standardisations Directorate

The *Standardisations Directorate* (SSD, also Standards Vekllei) works to unify management and supervision of state bodies and assets in Vekllei. It also mandates the responsibilities and visual identity of all departments of the Government and boroughs of the Commonwealth, including the appearance and manuals of style of Commonwealth infrastructure and publications. Its work includes both operating procedures and major brand elements like flags and logos, and specific linguistic and typographic features including typefaces, preferred punctuation and symbols. It has considerable authority over other departments, which usually lack autonomy to enforce their own visual identity independently. Most visual work for the Standardisations Directorate is performed by in-house designers and artists.

#### Standards Vekllei

The *General Office of the Standardisations Directorate* (GOSED), commonly *Standards Vekllei*, administrates the directorate, and determines its operations through direct liaison with the Interior and Commonwealth Administrations.

#### Standards Press of Vekllei

The *Standards Press* is a publishing house organised vertically in the SSD to prepare and publish materials including technical manuals, standard compilation books, and industrial bulletins.

#### Industrial Standards of Vekllei

The *Industrial Standards of Vekllei* (INSTA) regulates industrial regulatory and safety standards of industrial and manufacturing work. It also advises industry groups on product certification, and acts as a Commonwealth prosecutor in criminal breaches of industrial standards. INSTA is divided into sixteen technical committees that oversee particular industries. INSTA prosecutes cases of severe negligence or breach of Commonwealth standards, and advises domestic prosecution towards the [Accreditation Inspectorate](/utopia/society/government/#inspectorate-vekllei).

#### Commercial Standards of Vekllei

The *Commercial Standards of Vekllei* (COMSTA) regulates Commonwealth standards of small and medium-sized commercial businesses that are otherwise unaffiliated with bureaus proper. It also advises [GOSED](/utopia/society/government/#standards-vekllei) on changes to its technical, safety and design committees. It also routinely interfaces with the [ADCA](/utopia/society/government/#vekllei-commons-audit-committee) for internal standards compliance.

Since private commerce in Vekllei exists outside of the bureau framework, the license of COMSTA is broader and flexible, and regularly relies upon contracted industry contacts to fill places on its less defined technical committees.

### State Assets Directorate

The *State Assets Directorate* manages state-owned companies across the Commonwealth, particularly those with considerable international trade. These include several major industrial firms in Vekllei, like General Reactor S.A. and International Rocketry S.A. Though the State Assets Directorate functions as an administrator, state-owned companies in Vekllei are operated independently of COSMOCOM and maintain their own budgets and finances.

### Statistics Directorate

The *Statistics Directorate* (also Statistics Vekllei) collects and publishes statistics concerning the people, economy and geography of Vekllei. Along with other COSMOCOM directorates, the Statistics Directorate organises research into trends of Vekllei demography and geography. The Statistics Directorate also coordinates the Vekllei Census. Statistics Vekllei also provides broad data collection and publishing services for other Interior and Commonwealth ministries and secretariats. 

#### Statistics Press of Vekllei

The *Statistics Press* is a publishing house responsible for preparing materials relevant to the work of the Statistics Directorate, including printed editions of the Vekllei Census and ministerial reports used in the Commonwealth and Interior Parliaments. It also publishes books commercially for the public.

### Vekllei Electoral Commission

The *Vekllei Electoral Commission* (VEC) conducts elections, by-elections and referendums in Vekllei. It also maintains the Vekllei Electoral Roll, and designs electorates, apportionments and redistributions in the Home Islands.

The Electoral Commission also negotiates the registration of political candidates and their funding through the Public Visibility Scheme, in collaboration with the COSMOCOM general office. In addition, the Commission provides electoral supervisory services to other Commonwealth member-states and, occasionally, monitors foreign elections as an independent auditor as part of the Interior Government's overseas political commitments.
