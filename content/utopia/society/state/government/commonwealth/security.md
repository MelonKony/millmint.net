## Overview
{{<boxtag teal>}}OPSEC{{</boxtag>}}

The *Commonwealth Security Secretariat* (OPSEC) is the mother organisation of the internal and external security organs of the Vekllei government. Its constitutional mission includes intelligence gathering, espionage, special policing, and state security. It is headed by the Secretary of Security, and reports directly to the [Commonwealth Parliament](/utopia/society/state/government/commonwealth/).

### Commonwealth Military Command

The *Commonwealth Military Command* (CMC) is the unifying command organisation for the Crown Armed Forces, responsible ultimately for facilitating Commonwealth control of the armed forces. While the [Palace](/utopia/society/state/palace/) retains direct command over the armed forces, defence activities are in practice a privilege of the Commonwealth parliaments and so the CMC exists primarily to carry out this arrangement. In principle, the CMC accommodates open communication between the Armed Forces and the Commonwealth, but more commonly acts as a *de facto* command organisation for broad military arrangements outside of direct military administration like defence policy, strategic planning, military infrastructure and logistics, and communications.

Commonwealth member-states usually maintain their own [defence ministries](/utopia/society/state/government/interior/defence/), and the CMC aims to standardise and consolidate defensive strength across the Commonwealth. It is made up of the following departments.

* **General Council**: CMC administration and parliament liaison.
* **Department of War**: All war-related strategic planning and activities, including preparation for operations.
* **Department of Peacekeeping**: All activities related to Vekllei peacekeeping and expeditionary operations.
* **Department of Training & Mobilisation**: Standardisation of training and mobilisation of troops across the Commonwealth.
* **Department of Communications**: Coordination between the parliaments and the Palace, as well as public information.
