## Overview

ﬂ∑ This article is UNFINISHED. It will be completed in the next couple of days.
{{</hint>}}

{{<hint panel>}}
**Education** emerged as a foundational right for Vekllei people in the constitution of the 4th Commonwealth, in the spirit of postwar democratisation and the rising of all people.
{{</hint>}}

The colloquial turn-of-phrase for the domestic Vekllei economy is "functionally moneyless," but the actual mechanisms of the internal Vekllei market is considerably more complex. While the average Vekllei person is insulated from money and money-management, their Commonwealth is a major entrep√¥t[^1] and has a reputation as an "Atlantic Middleman." Vekllei's facilitation of frictionless free trade, large foreign-exchange reserves and received foreign direct investments have resulted in decades of consistent economic growth, and has cemented its reputation as a financial hub between Europe and the Americas.

Vekllei's history as a trade hub contributes significantly to its perceived neutrality and its reputation as a meeting place for politics and business, and regularly hosts diplomatic missions as a neutral site. It maintains its moneyless primary economy by effectively isolating its primary ([domestic](#domestic-markets)) and secondary ([international](#international-markets)) markets, which are the reason for its [twin currencies](#currency) and its unusual hybrid market system. Because the Vekllei state manages all money as a function of its moneylessness, the international market and foreign trade is strongly characterised by dirigism and fundamentally beholden to the economic management of the [Ministry of Commerce](/cosmosol/), which acts as both a financial regulator and investment bank.

Vekllei people are enrolled in 9 years of compulsory education, provided by the [Commonwealth Education Secretariat](/solsec/) (SOLSEC). In addition, 3 years of pre-school and 3 years of senior secondary schooling are offered but not compulsory. All schools in Vekllei are funded by the state, which include community schools, state schools, studio schools, technical schools, faith schools and state boarding schools.

Compared to modern schooling overseas, Vekllei education places significant value on well-roundedness and practicable household and technical skills. Subject-based streams for specialised learning are common, but the basic compulsory Vekllei curriculum emphasises non-academic subjects and makes pre-tertiary subjects elective.

Vekllei has a strong tradition of school clubs and social organisations, and these are considered essential aspects of Vekllei education. Clubs and associations are often highly organised, and offer opportunities in industry and tertiary study. 

Compulsory and tertiary education is free for all Vekllei people, permanent residents and foreign workers. Homeschooling is illegal except by those holding a teaching certificate, and is supervised by a local school which issues the child's diploma. In this context, homeschooling is almost nonexistent in the Commonwealth. About 15% of the Commonwealth Budget is allocated towards education.

Examples of Vekllei school uniform and its functional diversity
{{</hint>}}

All schools in Vekllei share the same uniform, made compulsory by the [Education Secretariat](/solsec/). The Vekllei uniform is simple and purchased independently, usually from department stores. The only badged items are the tie and jewellery/pins. It is worn across all ages of schooling, including tertiary education, and by some teachers as well.

Although the items are not issued by individual schools, they are provided by the All-Commonwealth School Directorate on request and as such constitute a uniform rather than a dress code. The uniform system was designed in 2015 by French migrant Charles-√âdouard Laurent to be accessible and comfortable, and so that individual items could continue to be worn after schooling concluded. It is iconic overseas and well-regarded by most Vekllei students.
