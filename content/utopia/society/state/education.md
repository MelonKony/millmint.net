## Overview

{{<hint panel>}}
**Education** emerged as a foundational right for Vekllei people in the constitution of the 4th Commonwealth, in the spirit of postwar democratisation and the rising of all people.
{{</hint>}}

Education in Vekllei is a good example of the 'system working backwards,' the popular phrase to describe the Floral Period moving in two different directions at once. Is it modern, supplied and robust in the Western tradition -- children wear uniforms, are divided into school years and knowledge is arranged and taught in subjects. Other aspects of the Vekllei curriculum are novel by comparison.

Nonetheless, there is something quite interesting going on in Vekllei education that is not immediately apparent at its surface. First, compulsory schooling runs for 4-5 days a week, depending on student commitments to elective and extracurricular activities. Government schools do not employ standardised testing, and rely on subject-specific means of assessment including reviews, presentations and portfolios. The [Vekllei Curriculum](#curriculum) emphasises practicable and technical skills that blur the lines between school, community and home. At its core, education in Vekllei is considered a foundation of Vekllei democracy, and like other foundations it is free, abundant and compulsory.

> Education is a founding aspect of the 4th Commonwealth and is to be reaffirmed constantly and faithfully by all Parliaments and public servants, and to this end is to be provided for as a highest priority of the new Parliament.

Homeschooling is illegal except by those holding a teaching certificate, and is supervised by a local school which issues the child's diploma. In this context, homeschooling is almost nonexistent in the Commonwealth. About 15% of the Commonwealth Budget is allocated towards education.

The colours of uniforms may vary in constituent member-states of the Commonwealth -- for example, the Kalina Isles use dark green in place of navy. Nonetheless, the Education Uniform standards are set at the Commonwealth level and are generally adopted in whole.

Although the items are not issued by individual schools, they are provided by the All-Commonwealth School Directorate on request and as such constitute a uniform rather than a dress code. The uniform system was designed in 2015 by French migrant Charles-Ã‰douard Laurent to be accessible and comfortable, and so that individual items could continue to be worn after schooling concluded. It is iconic overseas and well-regarded by most Vekllei students.

Many schools make use of felt armbands to distinguish students or to signal membership in clubs or student councils. These are traditionally red, but may also be green or blue depending on their use.
