## Why Utopia?
{{< hint panel>}}
Vekllei is a jumble of very pure, obsessive instincts that are illustrated to make them look and feel real. I want to take purity seriously by considering its implications in the real world. Vekllei does not use money -- a very straightforward and fantastical idea. Of course, moneylessness has extraordinary implications, and to maintain the purity of the idea we have to work very hard.

Simplicity is actually very complicated, and so Vekllei is very complicated to justify the simplicity. It's filled with things I value and people I admire. You'll find hundreds of posts and many articles on this site, and all of them are designed to make this place and its people feel real.

Just a few things to keep in mind:

* This place is **iterative** -- canon disappears, people change appearance and the systems of Vekllei twist and turn as I do.
* This place is **good-spirited** -- Vekllei is escapism, and although the dark accompanies the light, this project is supposed to be escapist and fun.
* This place is **constantly expanding** -- I try out new styles, mediums and methods of distribution all the time. Some of them work, some of them don't. That's part of the fun of it!

* **Vekllei is a utopia**, but that doesn't mean I don't take it seriously or consider its society pragmatically.
* **It's full of stuff I love**, but that doesn't mean it's perfect. Personal growth can come from bad experiences.
* **I draw in certain styles**, but Vekllei isn't based off any one country.
* **Vekllei is mostly self-contained stories**, but I experiment with mediums and methods all the time.

## F.A.Q.
{{< details title="Frequently Asked Questions" open=true >}}
#### Who are you?

[A Tasmanian illustrator.](/news/about/)

#### You‚Äôre not Japanese?

„ÅäÂâç„ÅØ„ÇÇ„ÅÜÊ≠ª„Çì„Åß„ÅÑ„Çã. Hope to live there for a couple of years someday.

#### Why is Vekllei a utopia?

It makes me feel better about my life and the world. It‚Äôs escapism; it‚Äôs a dream.

#### It‚Äôs a bit cringe to grandstand your political beliefs, doncha think?

Vekllei is a personal utopia. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm selling. At least you‚Äôre getting good opinions.

#### Where‚Äôs the tension if it‚Äôs perfect?

Vekllei can be cynical and tragic in places. Utopia is more than just idealistic fantasy, and can contain bad things.

#### Is there a novel? A story? A comic?

I‚Äôm working on a comic right now. I‚Äôm pretty much working on Vekllei full-time so I‚Äôm hoping to announce it soon. I‚Äôve got a lot of different Vekllei projects going.

#### Where is Vekllei?

Iceland.

#### Why does Vekllei look Japanese?

Vekllei is like a country of Scandinavians speaking French with an Australian accent in Sh≈çwa era Japan/Maoist China/Taiwan etc. Vekllei looks however I imagine utopia looks.

#### How does that make sense?

Why can‚Äôt it just be cool?

#### Is your alt-history thought out?

Vekllei‚Äôs history is whatever I need it to be. I‚Äôm always trying to be realistic, but it‚Äôs all worked backwards from the setting. I‚Äôm not really ‚Äúworld-building‚Äù in the way some might understand it. Very little of it is published, most of it is retrieved on request. Just ask if you have questions.

#### Why does Vekllei call itself ‚Äúpetticoat socialist‚Äù?

Vekllei is set in a culture of Marxist revivalism in the 50s and 60s. A lot of Vekllei‚Äôs lexicon is set in that context. Vekllei is a decentralised democracy that doesn‚Äôt use money. It‚Äôs a sort of participatory economy. It's almost anarchic in that sense.

#### Why the "petticoat"?

Vekllei is a female country. Womanhood is decommodified. It's maternal, social and friendly where progressive utopian rhetoric is masculine, technocratic and historicist.

#### Who is Zelda?

Zelda is another name for [Tzipora](/utopia/characters/). She has two names specifically to confuse you.

## Futher Reading

For those curious about what sort of things go into a place like Vekllei, these are some of my favourite books. I've been asked about them before, so I've included this section in the hopes you enjoy them as much as I have. There are many more than these, so if you're interested, [contact me](/news/about). I'll update this list periodically as more occur to me.

{{<hint panel>}}
#### On the Origins of Modern Japanese Literature
**Karatani Kojin** | 1993

Karatani interrogates the appearance of Western conceptual artefacts (Landscape, The Child, Interiority) during the Meiji period in Japan. This book had a tremendous impact on my assumptions about the world and affected Vekllei tremendously.

#### Starting Point *&* Turning Point
**Miyazaki Hayao** | 2009 & 2014

These books are essentially a compilation of essays from Miyazaki's years as a filmmaker. He's an incredibly smart and insightful creative force whose work [I have written at length about](/news/essays/ghibli) before. For me, it's all really powerful, affecting stuff.

#### Three Faces of Utopianism Revisited
**Lyman Sargent** | 1994

This is the defining taxonomical look at the phenomena of utopianism and how it works. His breakdown of 'utopia' into both dystopian and eutopian elements is also my preffered descriptor and use of 'utopia' as a concept.

#### Towards a New Architecture
**Le Corbusier** | 1936

Vekllei is a postmodern mess, but also deeply sympathetic to the modernist instinct. I like the utopianism of the 20th Century, and Le Corbusier typifies that 'utopian' futurism we saw in that period. I like how single-minded he is about it. His buildings remain beautiful, many years on.
