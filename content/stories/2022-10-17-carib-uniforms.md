A lot of effort has been made over the years to rethink uniforms of society to be more open-ended and practical without catering to tasteless hippies or hedonistic individualists with a bone to pick with their old school principle.

Exploring options for a new Caribbean uniform, there were three primary considerations.

1. It should be comfortable and appropriate to the climate.
2. It should celebrate cultural traditions and the diversity of the modern Commonwealth Caribbean while also using Commonwealth conventions and linking all the republics.
3. It should be unbadged and uncomplicated except for accessories -- you should be able to wear a white school shirt to your first job after leaving school.

To this end, accessories like jewellery are permitted in all Commonwealth schools, for several reasons. Commonwealth countries are mostly egalitarian and jewellery is not a commodity, and students in Vekllei are treated generally as capable individuals.
