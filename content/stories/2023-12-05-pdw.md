A [HO/NI](/opsec/) analyst poses with one of the interior defence weapons hidden in their headquarters.

HO/NI stands for "Home Office/National Intelligence," and is the internal intelligence apparatus of {{<link/vekllei>}}. It is one of six bureaus: HO/NI, AB/NI, RB/NI EB/NI, OB/NI, and SA/NI.

{{<hint>}}
Although her weapon is obviously inspired by the uzi, it's actually a domestic Vekllei model descended from what the original uzi license. In this setting, both {{<link/vekllei>}} and [<span class="fi fi-il"></span> Israel](/israel/) (along with many others) are part of the [non-aligned movement](/free-nations/), and so a lot of trade flows between its members.
