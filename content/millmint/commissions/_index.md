### Choosing a commission

You know what I draw -- it's probably how you found me. It should be no surprise then that I work best in my element. Consider how your commission can use my strengths as an artist, and I'll help you develop a concept.

| Good Concepts | I will not draw |
|---|---|
| <ul> <li>People & characters</li> <li>Uniforms & design</li> <li>Architecture & machines</li> <li>Scenes & places</li> </ul> | Pornographic, obscene,<br> immoral, or otherwise<br> offensive concepts |

### Sketches & Concepts: <span class="tag price" style="float: right;">$20-$50</span> <span class="tag" style="float: right; opacity: 60%;">1-2 days</span>
These are artworks that are good for developing an idea. They're rough around the edges, usually uncoloured, and full of energy. Prices vary on their scope and colour.

These are finished artworks that realise your people, machines and objects. They're great for showing off a character, helping you design a vehicle or visualise a machine. Prices vary on the complexity of depicted items and artwork detail.

### Process & delivery

1. Contact me with your idea. We'll talk about what you want and whether I'm a good fit. If you decide to commission me, I'll give a quote in writing and an estimated completion date.
2. I'll produce a preliminary sketch. This will be used as a reference for the finished work, and is a good time to make conceptual changes.
3. If you like what you see, you'll pay Â½ the price quoted as a deposit. At this point, you're committed to the work.
4. I'll finish the commission, and will give updates on request.
5. Once finished, I'll forward a watermarked image as a preview. If you're satisfied, you'll receive your artwork and a **MillMint Gift Basketâ„¢** upon payment of the outstanding sum.
