[**/Essays/**](/news/essays/) holds an archive of the things that I ([Hobart](/news/about/)) have written over the years. I have a background in journalism and media criticism, which doesn't bode well for the quality of the essays linked below. My favourites are [*Not Long in Hong Kong*](/news/essays/hongkong/), an angry reflection on my time in Hong Kong, and [*A Universal Nostalgia*](/news/essays/ghibli/), my honours thesis on utopian spatiality in the films of Studio Ghibli -- mostly used as evidence of my love of Ghibli.
