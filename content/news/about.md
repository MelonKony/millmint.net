**Hello, [I'm Hobart](https://images.millmint.net/images/mastheads/author.png)**. I'm an Australian illustrator and writer living and working in Tasmania. I like machines, midcentury design and visiting new places. I studied as a journalist, but now work in illustration.

Vekllei has existed in some form since I was a kid, but I started working on it properly in 2017.

You can follow my progress on this project on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/melon.kony/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MelonKony), or join [my subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei).
