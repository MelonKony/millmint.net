**Hi, I'm Hobart**. I'm an Australian illustrator and writer living and working in Tasmania. I like machines, midcentury architecture and Tasmania. I studied as a journalist, but now work in illustration full-time.

I'm currently trying to learn how to cook. I walk most afternoons around my home town, which inspires a lot of how Vekllei looks and feels. Vekllei has existed in some form since I was a kid, but I started working on it properly in 2017.

Follow me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/melon.kony/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MelonKony), or join [my subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei). You can **write to me** at hobart‚òÖmillmint.netÔºà‚òÖ‚Üí@Ôºâ.
