## 1. What is this project?

{{< hint panel >}}
**Utopia** has a lot of definitions, but in the end it's about what it feels like. It has to be personal, otherwise it isn't all that different from sci-fi. So utopia is about what feels right by the metrics of one person; an expression of worldview.
{{< /hint >}}

<span class="fc">V</span>
**ekllei is supposed to be an 'epoch of rest'**. It's a project that's become very big, with a long storyline and lots of characters, but at its heart this world is about peaceful escapism and whimsical nostalgia. This is a land of both plenty and pleasure, filled with the good and bad things of life, telling stories from a better place than our own.

Although a comic is on the way soon, for now Vekllei exists in snippets through self-contained posts, which you can find at the [Archive](/posts/). This site also serves as a repository and archive for information about Vekllei.

Vekllei is a 'worldbuilding' project, which means it doesn't always look like a traditional storytelling endeavour. It introduces parts of an imaginary place that might not be revealed in a traditional linear story.

Vekllei is also a 'utopian' project, which means that it's a form of *social dreaming*. It's a fantasy built out of the stresses and problems of the present, and so even if Vekllei people might not *talk* like you or *look* like you, there's a chance some part of this world may feel like you do.

This means that all sorts of themes and influences show up in my work. Vekllei has the [language](/utopia/vekllei/language) of French-Chinese spoken with an Australian accent, a native people of mixed Inuit-Scandinavian descent, and a modern industrial society that's going backwards.  

{{< details title="Project Fact Sheet" open=true >}}
1. This place is **iterative** -- canon disappears, people change appearance and the systems of Vekllei twist and turn as I do.
2. This place is **good-spirited** -- Vekllei is escapism, and although the dark accompanies the light, this project is supposed to be calming and fun.
3. This place is **constantly expanding** -- I try out new styles, mediums and methods of distribution all the time. Some of them work, some of them don't. I'm looking to start a comic and make an animated trailer for the project, so stay tuned for that!

## 2. Three Utopias

Vekllei is **place**, but it's also a **people**, created by [Hobart](/newsdesk/about). In this sense, there are three utopias in this project, along which posts are categorised.

* **Author** -- essays, reflection and discussion
* **Landscape** -- guides, diagrams and analysis
* **Character** -- stories, moments and memories

So what does 'utopia' mean? It’s latin for “no place”. It's a forgotten history, a missed opportunity -- a perfect place to escape to. It's a dream facing our past.

Vekllei is a very good place to live, but **it is not perfect**. Although many utopias are presented as perfect Edens of Earth, Vekllei is *utopie concreté*. It is a *dirty utopia* full of the inconveniences, inefficiencies and heartbreak of reality. The idea of my utopia, then, is to settle the bad things of life in a beautiful framework.

Utopia is a form of *social dreaming*, much like worldbuilding, linked to the values and priorities of its author. In utopian studies, “utopia” is usually broken down further:

* **Eutopia —** “good place”
* **Dystopia —** “bad place”

Note that both form a part of the “utopia” — this is appropriate, since Vekllei is grounded in a social realism that acknowledges the good and bad parts of life. Indeed, they are inseparable — you cannot have the light without the dark. Such is the internal contradiction of any good utopia.

### Utopia as *Author*

{{<columns>}}
**Utopias as Author** refers to the fact that all utopias are deeply personal; they're as intimate as dreams. There is no 'author proxy' here because the whole thing is a proxy of authorship; an expression of individual experience and memory. Is it self-indulgent? Almost certainly. But if art is expression, why should dreams be excluded?

### Utopia as *Landscape*

{{<columns>}}
**Utopias of landscape** (the *topos*) are the stuff you traditionally associate with the utopian tradition -- these are utopias of place. They include utopian cities, states, economies, machines, and any part of local physicality. When I talk about *landscape*, I use it in one of two ways.

* **Landscape** as it refers to physical space, like cities, woodlands and oceans.
* **Landscape** as it refers to the human metaphysic of place -- the way we build and identify physical spaces in our mind. For example, most people today distinguish between 'the city' and 'nature'. In Vekllei, they don't.

{{</columns>}}

### Utopia as *Character*
{{<columns>}}
**Utopias of character** are what I call utopian premises of life experience; stuff you can't construct from stone and concrete. Character utopias make up for the limitations of utopian space by recognising and providing for a new utopian dimension -- people, and personality. If the obsessive utopian can create imaginary communities from social dreams, why not people? Character utopias sum up an ideal life experience, personality, body and taste. [Zelda](/utopia/characters/#2-tzipora-zelda-desmoisnes) is one such character utopia.

## 3. Where to from here?

My little 'epoch of rest' is pretty much the only thing I enjoy doing. It's the melting pot of my whole life experience -- from interest and hobbyism to ideology and insecurity. It's the sum of a worldview, a whole person, and to that end I think utopia is a powerful form of self-expression.

I plan to tell lots of stories in Vekllei in lots of different ways. This wiki is one of them -- it allows me to fill out the world in a new format that better catalogues the scope of this project.

I also plan to start work on a comic in late October 2020, and in 2021 I intent to produce a short animated trailer for the project. You can follow me along on these adventures on [my Discord](https://discord.gg/dCE6vSU) or the [Vekllei subreddit](www.reddit.com/r/vekllei).

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy this adventure in dreaming.

## 4. F.A.Q.

Let's run through some frequently asked questions and common misconceptions about the project.

**Who are you?**

A Tasmanian illustrator.

**You’re not Japanese?**

お前はもう死んでいる

**Why is Vekllei a utopia?**

It makes me feel better about my life and the world. It’s escapism; it’s a dream.

**It’s a bit cringe to grandstand your political beliefs, doncha think?**

Vekllei is a personal utopia. That’s what I’m selling. At least you’re getting good opinions.

**Where’s the tension if it’s perfect?**

Vekllei is very cynical and tragic in places. Utopia is just a reflection of the author, good and bad.

**Is there a novel? A story? A comic?**

I’m working on a comic right now. I’m pretty much working on Vekllei full-time so I’m hoping to announce it soon. I’ve got a lot of different Vekllei projects going.

**Where is Vekllei?**

Iceland.

**Why does Vekllei look Japanese?**

Vekllei is like a country of Scandinavians speaking French with an Aussie accent in Shōwa era Japan/Maoist China/Taiwan etc. Vekllei looks however I imagine utopia looks.

**How does that make sense?**

Why can’t it just be cool?

**Is your alt-history thought out?**

Vekllei’s history is whatever I need it to be. I’m always trying to be realistic, but it’s all worked backwards from the setting. I’m not really “worldbuilding” in a typical sense. Very little of it is published, most of it is retrieved on request. Just ask if you have questions.

**Why does Vekllei call itself “petticoat socialist”?**

Vekllei is set in a culture of Marxist revivalism in the 50s and 60s. A lot of Vekllei’s lexicon is set in that context. Vekllei is a decentralised democracy that doesn’t use money. It’s a sort of participatory economy. It's almost anarchic in that sense.

**Why the "petticoat"?**

Vekllei is a female country. Womanhood is decommodified. It's maternal, social and friendly where progressive utopian rhetoric is masculine, technocratic and historicist.

**Who is Zelda?**

Zelda is another name for Tzipora. She has two names specifically to confuse you.

**What is the “bulletin”?**

I publish the [*Atlantic Bulletin*](/newsdesk/bulletin/2020) once a month via email. It’s got the month’s posts in it as well as facts and tidbits from Vekllei. DM me an email if you want to join.
