## 8. Culture

{{< hint panel >}}
**Although Vekllei culture** can be traced unevenly across its two thousand years of settlement, modern Vekllei is influenced primarily by a convergence of traditions informed by indigenous, religious and immigrant populations bound in the multiculturalism of the Floral Period Constitution. Contemporary Vekllei culture is heavily influenced by its bombing and occupation by the United Kingdom, and new policies of state secularism and multiracialism have dominated Vekllei's cultural legacy into the 21st Century.
