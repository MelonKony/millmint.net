	  <description>❖ This letter was sent out to Patrons in November 2020 Hello my lovelies,
Just a short update on where I’m at as we pass mid-month. I’ve pushed a couple of things back a day or two to finish a very cool/special post. You’ll see it on the reddit soon — it’ll be a really nice painting, and nothing like I’ve ever done before. Before the weekend.
I was hesitant to promise a timeframe for the comic draft, and for good reason.</description>

	  <description>❖ This letter was sent out to Patrons in December 2020 Hello beloved patrons,
This is your monthly update for the Petticoat Project.
There’s a new post up on the subreddit and a new article up on the website — a big one, about Vekllei, although it’s missing a history and culture section. Those are coming soon.
I won’t be mucking around on the website forever — trust me, I have no intention of abandoning my traditional post format for dry wiki articles — but it makes good infrastructure, and good infrastructure allows for growth and it also helps support new projects, like the comic.</description>

The first chapter of the comic is sketched. You will see it on Monday (about two days from this message). It won&amp;rsquo;t be inked but it&amp;rsquo;ll give you a very good idea of what the final chapter will look like at the end of the month. I look forward to reading your feedback, since it&amp;rsquo;s my first try at this sort of thing (well, minus the dozens of concepts trashed over the previous few months).</description>

It’s been a little while. I’ve called this meeting late because I’ve been working late. Let’s run this through quick, and we can all get back to bed.
You guys voted! Looks like our next themed ‘week’ (maybe fortnight) is Ocean Week. Great choice, lots of cool concepts coming. Mail Week (fortnight) has been a lot of fun, but it’s almost done.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s been a little while since my last direct communiqué. I laid off these for a bit, since I realised you probably didn&amp;rsquo;t need to have your inbox full of blog posts and delay announcements from me. Time better spent drawing I reckon.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had a couple things going on in my personal life, so I&amp;rsquo;ve had to put some of my wilder ambitions on hold for a bit.</description>

	  <description>❖ This letter was sent out to Patrons in July 2021 Hello beloved patrons,
Just checking in after a quiet July. It’s been quiet for several reasons, most of them good.
We had a few posts this month, but I’ve also been working on larger things — the comic, of course, but I have also spent many days working on a special map of Vekllei, to be revealed soon.</description>
