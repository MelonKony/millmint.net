	  <![CDATA[This outfit was too cobian-pilled not to draw it. Tzipora is wearing a shirt that has a collar and no buttons (low IQ). In Cobian&rsquo;s context here, wide trousers and loose layers are staple youth fashion in Vekllei&rsquo;s alt-retrofuturism.
This old post talks about their fashion internationalism, and you can see another Cobian outfit in this one.]]>

	  <![CDATA[Scouts learning to shoot feat. Kefra, from the excellent @choitukaee It&rsquo;s not unusual for Vekllei scouts to learn to shoot. They learn for combat, not for sport, and often practice shooting standing and with irons.
Not all scouts learn to shoot, just as not all conscripts go and fight.
Instead, casual familiarity with firearms bolsters a general confidence in their independence from Europe and the Americas, and indicates the principles of their free and self-managing localism.]]>

<p>She likes rumba music just fine, but that&rsquo;s not why she tunes in. She&rsquo;s not really sure why she tunes in.</p>

<p>In <a style="color: var(--color-vekllei)" href="/vekllei/"><span class="fi fi-com"></span> Vekllei</a>, three men can build a house in three days. In a ballet of material, machines and planning, this brutal pace has become necessary in postwar Vekllei, as the country saw its population recover and then double in independence. Complicated by <a href="/housing/">postwar housing politics</a> and a disastrous experience with slumlike public housing, the country has had to advance and systematise the construction industry.</p>
<p>Construction begins with a residential or commercial petition, submitted either to the <a style="color: var(--color-commons)" href="/bureau-of-housing/"><span class="fi fi-min-commons fis"></span> Bureau of Housing</a> or the <a style="color: var(--color-commons)" href="/bureau-of-public-works/"><span class="fi fi-min-commons fis"></span> Bureau of Public Works</a>. After a two-week approval process,  the bureau will assign an architecture agency to the project via your municipality, who will liaise with the largest government construction company, the <a style="color: rgb(232, 13, 64)" href="/nch/"><span class="fi fi-min-nch fis"></span> National Construction House</a>. Architects have a broad role in Vekllei, and are responsible for projects from planning to completion. They contribute much more than drawings &ndash; architects now work in an automatic construction system, and so construction needs to conform to its parameters.</p>
<p>Almost all construction in Vekllei is partially or completely automatic, in the sense that it is completed by &ldquo;automen&rdquo; &ndash; <a href="/computers/">robots</a>. Although some Vekllei robots resemble independent machines, many more are attached to existing systems, either in factories or vehicles like this one pictured above, called the NCH Automatic Truck. Built on an Agraura No. 6 Hevi-Hauler chassis, the Auto Truck can construct small structures completely independently, laying bricks and tiles, pouring concrete and mortar, and otherwise assembling structural materials with its crane implement called a &ldquo;head&rdquo; according to electronic plans programmed by an architect.</p>
<p>These plans, called &ldquo;Computer Master Drawings,&rdquo; incorporate a broad catalogue of plans, standards and materials built to many specifications and styles. While many modern Vekllei houses use completely prefabricated styles, the NCH Auto Truck can do much more, including finishing a home brick by brick. There is no fear of drab, uniform prefab homes &ndash; the flexibility of automatic construction is such that architects are rarely limited by their automatic tools.</p>
<p>The NCH Auto Truck generally accompanies materials trucks and an Automan Command Truck &ndash; a robot hauler that carries independent tracked or walking robots that finish the interior and run electrics. In certain projects, trains may be used instead with a special rail siding constructed. In this context, construction labourers spend more time setting up and aiding robots than they do laying brick or digging foundations.</p>
<p>Although the <a style="color: rgb(232, 13, 64)" href="/nch/"><span class="fi fi-min-nch fis"></span> National Construction House</a> and its automatic processes are ubiquitious in Vekllei, the Auto Truck is actually built licensed from a French design. You can find automatic construction in many parts of the world, but <a href="/bulletin/productivity/">labour is uniquely expensive</a> in Vekllei and so the <a style="color: var(--color-commons)" href="/ministry-of-the-commons/"><span class="fi fi-min-commons fis"></span> Ministry of the Commons</a>, flush with resources cash, has invested heavily in machines to replace the man.</p>

<p>Their uniforms are assembled off the rack from department stores. While all of Vekllei uses navy and white, cultural items vary their appearance dramatically and there are no restrictions on hair or jewellery.</p>

<p>Oh, and the servicewoman is carrying a sabre! This isn&rsquo;t just ceremonial; Vekllei police use blunt sabres as a defensive and crowd control weapon. They are very rarely used to inflict pain, but are a powerful deterrent and she is trained in its use.</p>

<p>Vekllei uses photo-electric circuits in place of semiconductors and transistors. These are very powerful, and holographic memory has a lot of storage, but the computers themselves are room-sized and consequently consolidated. You can read more about them in the <a href="/computers/">computers</a> article.</p>
<p>Vekllei robots combine centralised computing (sent via radio or cables) with organic wetware for things like navigation and balance. Though creepy at first blush, in practice these are &ldquo;chemical steaks&rdquo; with zero cognitive function, simply passing electrical charges.</p>
<blockquote class="note ">
  <span class="text"><p><strong>Notes on Vekllei Robots</strong></p>
<p>The organic wetware of Vekllei robots are situated in an immersion fluid that provides nutrients and prevents decay, and just needs to be swapped out on occasion like an oil change. Vekllei&rsquo;s world also has other biotechnologies like industrial lab meat production, but those are for consumption.</p>
<p>In general, this universe has a superior understanding of brain structure and their function, and so has some means to design new ones that use light-seeing primitive eyes to move. There is not, however, much interest or appetite for actually fashioning a cognisant brain that can think. Especially in Vekllei, the line is drawn pretty clearly and bringing life artificially into the world via consciousness would be considered a crime against nature, and wouldn&rsquo;t suit any preexisting industrial or commercial purpose.</p>

You can only fly them with Commonwealth Airways, the flag carrier of Vekllei and a vital link between its 71 island republics.
Design Notes
This jet flies primarily between islands in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, and it really needs low-speed flight manoeuvrability to properly land on runways that aren&rsquo;t as long as those designed for larger, delta-wing international jets.]]>

A century of miniaturisation of fission has improved safety in vehicles but it&rsquo;s still not perfect. The aircraft has gyroscopes to auto-scramble the reactor and the reactor system is well-shielded.</p>
