<p>Vekllei people wear the same uniforms from preschool right through university, but they vary at the tertiary level depending on their field of study. Law students conventionally wear suits; scientists wear coats. Humanities, mathematics and other deskbound types wear the same styles they did in high school.</p>
<p>Their uniforms are assembled off the rack from department stores. While all of Vekllei uses navy and white, cultural items vary their appearance dramatically and there are no restrictions on hair or jewellery.</p>

The stewardess in pictured here is from Helena. The use of republic flags on uniforms is very common.
Vekllei has nearly 70 republics and Vekllei people think of themselves as a union of city-states belonging to one country, so that kind of upstream and downstream federalism is a core part of their identity.]]>

	  <![CDATA[Going to the moon is a big deal and you dress up for it. Travel to the moon is a whole process â€” you have to fly to the astroport on Ascension, attend the flight briefing and have a medical checkup. Eventually, Tzipora and Baron are on Commonwealth Starlines Flight 1 to the moon.
Although the timing coincided with Tzipora&rsquo;s birthday, you can&rsquo;t time a trip to the moon. There are only about sixty slots a day and there&rsquo;s a two-year wait.]]>

While Western Europe has wasted two decades trying to make caseless ammunition work, Vekllei has a simple, capable and comfortable standard rifle called the Cateral No. 8. The 8 shoots straight, every time.
It&rsquo;s a lightweight, simple rifle with great handling. It strips down to three large pieces, and is encased in smooth polymer so it won&rsquo;t catch on your kit.]]>

  <div class="text"><p><strong>Notes on Vekllei Robots</strong></p>
<p>The organic wetware of Vekllei robots are situated in an immersion fluid that provides nutrients and prevents decay, and just needs to be swapped out on occasion like an oil change. Vekllei&rsquo;s world also has other biotechnologies like industrial lab meat production, but those are for consumption.</p>
<p>In general, this universe has a superior understanding of brain structure and their function, and so has some means to design new ones that use light-seeing primitive eyes to move. There is not, however, much interest or appetite for actually fashioning a cognisant brain that can think. Especially in Vekllei, the line is drawn pretty clearly and bringing life artificially into the world via consciousness would be considered a crime against nature, and wouldn&rsquo;t suit any preexisting industrial or commercial purpose.</p>

You can only fly them with Commonwealth Airways, the flag carrier of Vekllei and a vital link between its 71 island republics.
Design Notes
This jet flies primarily between islands in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, and it really needs low-speed flight manoeuvrability to properly land on runways that aren&rsquo;t as long as those designed for larger, delta-wing international jets.]]>
