	  <description>✿ This image is a website-exclusive sketch produced as a masthead for the November Patreon update. The typeface in this image is a preview version &amp;ldquo;Nay Aug&amp;rdquo; by Alex Tomlinson, who you can follow here. Fruit Tingles (Fodsa Spas) are a chalky sweet popular in Vekllei. They fizz in your mouth and come in several flavours. They&amp;rsquo;re as popular today as they were a hundred and fifty years ago when they were first produced by Montre Confectionary in 1936.</description>

	  <description>This is Tzipora and Cobian. They have not been friends for very long but they like each other a lot. Tzipora weighs nearly 10kg less than her friend, so she gets piggy backs more often.

	  <description>Porno is available over-the-counter at most book stores. Some industry associations attempt to limit availability to minors but generally it&amp;rsquo;s at the discretion of the shopkeeper. Often, shame and embarassment are more powerful tools than legislation in Vekllei.
Generally it&amp;rsquo;s pretty traditional stuff supported by columns and fiction, although it varies between pornographers. It&amp;rsquo;s quite common for well-known Vekllei models to end up in nude shoots either before or after their fame.</description>

	  <title>The Principles of &#34;Human Decay&#34;</title>

	  <description>Talking about utopia in landscape is easy — Vekllei is a glittering midcentury paradise that fosters human life as a wonderful dream.
Talking about utopia in character is much harder. How can you find utopia in flawed and sometimes unattractive human beings? By what metric is the vague, intuitive values of a utopia measured against a living person?
In Upen, the nondenominational animism of Vekllei, there is the living principle of Dumousiantopet: “beautiful and seperate”.</description>

	  <description>She loved helping out. It was important to her, as an ageless girl of ultimately transient relationships, to be able to establish for herself a family wherever she lived. So within a few years of her arrival in Vekllei, she put time in as a warden for her apartment block and undertook the medical training that went with it.
She carried debts of blood because of how she sold out her friends some years before.</description>

	  <title>One Long Moment</title>

	  <description>The whole world gives way to a moment of silence. The other seasons are filled with noise and marrow, jerking and twisting with the pace of the clock. But a moment lasts forever — and wintertime is one long moment.
Although the uniforms got heavier and the commutes longer, Zelda would always like the wintertime. Even in the writhing digits of the city — the subways, the streetcars, the dockyards — snowbanks took the noise.</description>

	  <title>Too Old for Sleepovers</title>

	  <description>Even for those ageless kids, there’s a time when the charade of childhood comes to a head and begs a certain uncomfortable question: at what point does the whole thing — of immaturity, of carelessness, of sleepovers — start looking like two old women posturing around youth, indulging in a sick genetic perversion? At what age to they stop brushing each other’s hair and buying magazines?
The question wasn’t phrased like that, but it was there.</description>

	  <title>A story of community policing and sweet militia</title>

	  <description>As part of sundress municipalism, Vekllei’s villages and townships are mostly self-sufficient and self-regulating. Although a walk in the capital will take you past colossal apartment blocks and cinemas, libraries and schools of great magnificence, you are really looking at a hundred different communities going about personal business at their leisure. The villages are large and concrete now, but the people are are still there.
So does it surprise anyone that the police are just as much caregivers as law enforcement?</description>

	  <description>Look at it!
The bastard ate the lettuce! There&amp;rsquo;s a hole in the wire!
He&amp;rsquo;s cute but he&amp;rsquo;s a bastard!
I&amp;rsquo;ve been drawing a train for over two weeks now and I needed to draw something alive before I shinkansenned myself. This only took an hour or two but I&amp;rsquo;m not drawing enough and it feels like I&amp;rsquo;m running out of time to get good at drawing.</description>

	  <description>I caught a train out of Tokyo as far as it would go, and I ended up on a little platform in the mountains. Nice place.
Vekllei has a lot of mountains and a lot of trains.</description>

	  <title>Happy Summer Everyone</title>

	  <description>In Down Under it&amp;rsquo;s coming around summer, and things are heating up. It&amp;rsquo;s not my fault Yanks broke the northern hemisphere and made the weather go wrong.
Vekllei gets warm in the summer, reaching heights of 30C occasionally. For a variety of reasons. A city of gardens and flowerbeds (the most flowers per capita in the world, actually), apartment dwellers take turns watering their local gardens and clearing weeds. Most parks have utility as herb or fruit gardens, and so maintenance of those plants in summer is important.</description>

	  <description>Coming up on 2am here in East Australia. Had a rough day at work. Feeling pretty isolated and my other job starts in a few hours. I don’t know if it’s intrusive thoughts from OCD or just something everyone has, but four or five times a day I’ll have some sort of regret pop right into my head. I can’t seem to move on from much. Tzipora’s the same. She’s probably thinking about physical education from early that day.</description>
