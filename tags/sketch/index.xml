      <description>Archived from the original article here  üå∫ This article predates the project, and should be considered non-canon.  This is Tzipora and Cobian. They have not been friends for very long but they like each other a lot. Tzipora weighs nearly 10kg less than her friend, so she gets piggy backs more often.

      <description>Archived from the original article here  üå∫ This article predates the project, and should be considered non-canon.  Porno is available over-the-counter at most book stores. Some industry associations attempt to limit availability to minors but generally it&amp;rsquo;s at the discretion of the shopkeeper. Often, shame and embarassment are more powerful tools than legislation in Vekllei.
Generally it&amp;rsquo;s pretty traditional stuff supported by columns and fiction, although it varies between pornographers.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  üå∫ This article predates the project, and should be considered non-canon.  Talking about utopia in landscape is easy ‚Äî Vekllei is a glittering midcentury paradise that fosters human life as a wonderful dream.
Talking about utopia in character is much harder. How can you find utopia in flawed and sometimes unattractive human beings? By what metric is the vague, intuitive values of a utopia measured against a living person?</description>

It was important to her, as an ageless girl of ultimately transient relationships, to be able to establish for herself a family wherever she lived. So within a few years of her arrival in Vekllei, she put time in as a warden for her apartment block and undertook the medical training that went with it.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  üå∫ This article predates the project, and should be considered non-canon.  The whole world gives way to a moment of silence. The other seasons are filled with noise and marrow, jerking and twisting with the pace of the clock. But a moment lasts forever ‚Äî and wintertime is one long moment.
Although the uniforms got heavier and the commutes longer, Zelda would always like the wintertime.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  üå∫ This article predates the project, and should be considered non-canon.  Even for those ageless kids, there‚Äôs a time when the charade of childhood comes to a head and begs a certain uncomfortable question: at what point does the whole thing ‚Äî of immaturity, of carelessness, of sleepovers ‚Äî start looking like two old women posturing around youth, indulging in a sick genetic perversion?</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  üå∫ This article predates the project, and should be considered non-canon.  As part of sundress municipalism, Vekllei‚Äôs villages and townships are mostly self-sufficient and self-regulating. Although a walk in the capital will take you past colossal apartment blocks and cinemas, libraries and schools of great magnificence, you are really looking at a hundred different communities going about personal business at their leisure.</description>

The bastard ate the lettuce! There&amp;rsquo;s a hole in the wire!
He&amp;rsquo;s cute but he&amp;rsquo;s a bastard!
 I&amp;rsquo;ve been drawing a train for over two weeks now and I needed to draw something alive before I shinkansenned myself. This only took an hour or two but I&amp;rsquo;m not drawing enough and it feels like I&amp;rsquo;m running out of time to get good at drawing.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  üå∫ This article predates the project, and should be considered non-canon.  I caught a train out of Tokyo as far as it would go, and I ended up on a little platform in the mountains. Nice place.
Vekllei has a lot of mountains and a lot of trains.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  üå∫ This article predates the project, and should be considered non-canon.  In Down Under it&amp;rsquo;s coming around summer, and things are heating up. It&amp;rsquo;s not my fault Yanks broke the northern hemisphere and made the weather go wrong.
Vekllei gets warm in the summer, reaching heights of 30C occasionally. For a variety of reasons. A city of gardens and flowerbeds (the most flowers per capita in the world, actually), apartment dwellers take turns watering their local gardens and clearing weeds.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  üå∫ This article predates the project, and should be considered non-canon.  Coming up on 2am here in East Australia. Had a rough day at work. Feeling pretty isolated and my other job starts in a few hours. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs intrusive thoughts from OCD or just something everyone has, but four or five times a day I‚Äôll have some sort of regret pop right into my head.</description>
