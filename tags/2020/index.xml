      <description>Archived from the original article here  There‚Äôs a thousand years of history in Vekllei‚Äôs armed forces, though you‚Äôll find very little of it recalled casually today. Almost everything about Vekllei‚Äôs prewar society was scorched by the bombs, and the scraps of military infrastructure that survived were appropriated in the subsequent British occupation.
Since independence, a slate has been wiped clean, and a modern fighting force has replaced the colonial legions and battleships of yesteryear.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Pachinki is a world of Tzipora‚Äôs own creation, a dorky retreat from the difficulties she has in Vekllei. Tzipora always loved stories of wild places and adventure, and Pachinki blossomed organically from within her daydreams. Eventually she started writing and drawing it. When she was sad, bored or anxious, she would descend back into Pachinki‚Äôs world of ancient magic, edible gems and pirates.</description>

Food was everywhere and you ate until you were satisfied. Around each corner was a new cinema or basement lounge, and water trickled through the streets like all mythic garden cities. It was a paradise.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  This is Bea, an energetic Botanist with the Landscape Bureau of Vekllei. People know her as an eccentric young woman easily persuaded by cottage-fashions, but she takes her work very seriously and spends most of her waking hours documenting the dense temperate rainforests of Vekllei‚Äôs coastal lowlands. These are not particularly adventurous expeditions ‚Äî most of her work is performed along old trails and paths, but Bea finds the sublime amidst the mundane and has contributed enormously to the ecological understanding of local flora in the borough of Holsyim, where she was born.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  It would be misleading to characterise Vekllei as environmentalist in the usual idea of the word. Vekllei is no such thing. This is obvious in subtle ways, like Newda‚Äôs Dumousiantopet, or ‚Äúbeautiful and seperate,‚Äù which advocates the separation of human and natural design. It is also policy; Vekllei is dependent on its landscape as part of Autosuffisouitopet, or ‚Äúself-sustenance,‚Äù and to this end sinks forests for hydroelectric dams and topples mountains for novel urban projects.</description>

 Tanizaki JunichiroÃÑ, 1918
The wind had died and it seemed that she would follow it. Crazy shadows distorted beneath car headlights. It occurred to her in some way that, as she approached dying, she was living out the ultimate dramatic fantasy of the American misplaced girl, in the same way the townsmen were fulfilling their grotesque constellation of death by murdering women.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  If you go back through my posts here, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice Tzipora is basically a cartoon whose only consistent characteristic is her iconography &amp;ndash; her hair fountain, bangs, round head and big smile. This isn&amp;rsquo;t really intentional. I&amp;rsquo;m just an amateur artist who is still learning to draw.
That doesn&amp;rsquo;t work so well in a comic with sequential panels, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on standardising my characters.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Editor‚Äôs note ‚Äî it‚Äôs getting close to 4 a.m. and I‚Äôm not sure I can even remember why I wrote this post. Everything is a fog. Expect revisions and possibly major changes in the morning.
Pictured above is Tzipora Desmoisnes, the Princess of the Earth and one of the most interesting persons of the last century. She has made good use of her 126 years on Earth (and counting), and a few samples have been chosen for your viewing pleasure.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Despite appearances, most of the population of Vekllei are Scandinavian, not Asian.
Zhu is the first time in a long time I&amp;rsquo;ve drawn an ethnically Chinese person. She was graciously lent to me to draw by u/boodyclap in an art trade. You can see his end of the deal here, complete with Tzipora balancing a baseball bat.
In Zhu&amp;rsquo;s homeland she suffers a meat-heavy diet, and Vekllei is the first time she&amp;rsquo;s seen a salad this big.</description>

This post will be pinned and serve as a stopgap until I can complete something more professional on my site.

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Tzipora had never been taller than anyone in Vekllei at a meagre 5‚Äô2, but she was taller than Shizuku Kobayashi. Like Tzipora, Shizuku had not physically aged a day since she was a child.
It was summer, and six days after Tzipora had arrived in Japan as a Gregori ambassador from Vekllei. Although she would not be the oldest victim of Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome until Quentin Cook‚Äôs (USA) infamous murder-suicide ten years later, she was one of the so-called &amp;ldquo;First Thirteen&amp;rdquo; publicised patients, and so was somewhat known to the international community.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  She‚Äôd accidentally starched her gi quarter-pleat in the wash. She held it self-consciously against her side as she watched the clouds navigate the sharp mountains that formed Montre‚Äôs deepest valleys. Even out here, where human presence was gentle and subservient to the land, Vekllei National Railways had tracks that serviced the smallest villages. Today it was high summer, and the slopes were green and free of ice.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  When Tzipora moved to study English and Vekllei literature at the university of Montre in 2075, she had to walk from the little home where she lived to Montre-Lola‚Äôs old concrete platform, which facilitated a single electric railcar each way, each day. If she was feeling lively, she could make it to the platform in a half hour. On the days where she dreaded sighting her plimsolls in the shoebox, it might take forty-five minutes.</description>

      <title>A Foreigner‚Äôs Guide to Female Traditional Dress in Vekllei</title>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Tzipora, illustrated here, is happy because her traditional dress makes her feel stylish and her cape is soft and warm.
Vekllei is an ancient culture with many inherited and vestigial artefacts. Nowhere is this more apparent than in her national dress, particularly that for women, where old and new collide as they do all across Vekllei. Pre-war, post-war and future are present here.</description>

      <title>Hobart and Tzipora are off to Japan</title>

      <description>Archived from the original article here   Tzipora here is wearing a simplified form of Vekllei‚Äôs national dress, which plays fast and loose with lace and showcases some of Vekllei‚Äôs more decadent iconography. Long gi (decorative quarter-pleats you‚Äôve seen around) accompany sun petticoats, or Vekllei lace aprons. Flowers take the place of astrology or the Zodiac in Vekllei, and so they often accompany spiritual runes (in upotenne, or religious script) about the girl.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  The summer had rolled into the valley, and so the air smelled of hot grass from the fields. It was quiet at the station, where a single train clacked each way in the afternoon. The only sound was the wind, which caught the heads of dry grass and roared up the slopes of the mountain ranges around her.
It seemed an exaggeration to even call it a station, since the bare concrete slab had been laid fifty years ago and left to crumble.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Moise has somehow been swindled out of his slow dance in Zelda‚Äôs eighth floor New Years party. I‚Äôd like to invite everyone here to come celebrate at the new Vekllei discord ‚Äî we mostly argue about architecture and share art and stories. No pressure, but at least you can hassle me directly about the gap between posts. Speaking of which, this one is a substitute ‚Äî the one I‚Äôm working on ended up being a bit too sad for an exciting new year, so I‚Äôll put the sad stuff off until Jan 2nd in favour of something happier tomorrow.</description>
