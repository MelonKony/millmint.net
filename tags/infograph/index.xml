      <description>Archived from the original article here   For all you&amp;rsquo;ve seen of Vekllei and her characters, you&amp;rsquo;ve never heard a single one of them speak. This post marks a little exploration into the Vekllei language, and a &amp;lsquo;soft launch&amp;rsquo; of my website, https://millmint.net. The proper launch will come at the end of the month.
This post will briefly discuss some elements shown in this infographic, but a large article on the language has been drafted here.</description>

This article appeared in Issue #3 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.   Unique among girls #  There are a lot of things Tzipora does differently to everybody else, and they start to make a lot more sense when you realise Tzipora either does not realise she is unusual, or does not care.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  ðŸŒ¼ Featured in the Atlantic
This article appeared in Issue #3 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.   Like a lot of girls of poverty, Tzipora was very possessive of her things. No food was ever left on her plate. There was a deep anxiety that whatever wasnâ€™t claimed would be lost.
She was also naturally obsessive and material-oriented, keenly aware of the importance of objects measured by metrics in her own silly head.</description>

This article appeared in Issue #2 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.   Vekllei, legendarily, does not use circulate currency. Goods and services are moved and offered arbitrarily, provided amply in abundance. Anything that is not abundant is manufactured and distributed directly under the control of a bureau, which is a trade organ responsible to the affairs of the country.</description>

This article appeared in Issue #1 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.   Baron had inherited the apartment from his uncle, who passed in the year following his parents. It was in a mixed residential-industrial neighbourhood, adjacent to a canvas factory. Out back was a rivulet, which roared in the long rainstorms of early April.</description>

      <description>Station Dogs #  Iâ€™m starting a series looking at the lives and machines of domestic Vekllei life.
Vekllei National Railways, or â€˜VK Railâ€™ was the bastard of six major pre-war rail companies that were extinguished along with the society that housed them. Today there are three rail companies in Vekllei, but all of them operate under direct supervision of a Vekllei Industry Bureau ( making it Venrouiva, in other words) and are only broken up for reasons of logistics.</description>
