	  <description>Overview #  ߷ This article is about Vekllei  Computers are used to subsidise rather than multiply productivity in Vekllei. This does not mean that they do not make commerce or industry more efficient, or open new means of communication between people &amp;ndash; only that they are understood foremost as a social benefit that enables the more idealistic features of the Floral Period and its functional moneylessness. Vekllei is working towards participatory work, and computers are among the dream&amp;rsquo;s most valuable means in which it is being realised.</description>

	  <description>Overview #  ߷ This article is about the Vekllei state  Vekllei is positioned uniquely between the anarchy and control. This article looks at its government, which facilitates and manages these competing instincts. As the representative of the Vekllei state, and the body of its human interests, the Vekllei Government is second only to the Sovereign in its authority over Vekllei society.  The Government of Vekllei refers to both the Administration of the Interior of the Vekllei Islands and the international governing body of the Vekllei Commonwealth.</description>
