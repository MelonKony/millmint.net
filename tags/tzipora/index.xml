<p>This illustration is a spiritual successor to <a href="/stories/edc/">this story</a> from 2020.</p>
<p>Many institutions in Vekllei give branded accessories to students and employees. Although it is rare that clothing itself is branded, items like bags, pins, jewellery, ties and coats are commonly designed and gifted by corporations and government as a means of fostering community.</p>
<p>Perhaps most visible in Vekllei society is the &ldquo;company purse,&rdquo; a quirk of this culture in which almost all employment with a major company awards a branded purse, designed in the colours or imagery of the employer. Vekllei government also gifts &ldquo;company purses,&rdquo; as do government schools by extension.</p>
<p>It is not unusual for secondary school students to carry purses or briefcases, since students in Vekllei are not generally assigned homework and so leave their books at school.</p>
<p>Tzipora&rsquo;s purse depicted here incorporates elements of the circular Parliament of Education logo, and its colours. It was designed by Vekllei fashion house Spaa S.p.A, and Tzipora uses it to store all her best stuff.</p>
<blockquote class="hint panel">
  <div class="icon">
</div> 
  <div class="text"><ul>
<li><strong>Cola</strong>: Tzipora drinks a bottle of Ola Cola a day, usually in the grape flavour.</li>
<li><strong>Fruit Tingles</strong>: A popular sweet pastille, easily shared and useful for bribing favour.</li>
<li><strong>Book of the Week</strong>: Tzipora reads 2-3 paperbacks a week, mostly science fiction or fantasy but also some miscellaneous titles that catch her eye.</li>
<li><strong>Civic Passport</strong>: The Vekllei Civic Passport functions as both an international and internal passport, and contains essential documents and information. It has plastic cards which can be clipped in for things like student IDs.</li>
<li><strong>Safety Matches</strong>: For cigarettes and mischief.</li>
<li><strong>Loose Cigarettes</strong>: You aren&rsquo;t allowed to smoke in government schools, but Tzipora keeps a few cigarettes floating around in her purse for emergencies.</li>
<li><strong>Pen &amp; Pencil</strong>: The purse has special holders for writing utensils, the most important tool of students.</li>
<li><strong>Comb</strong>: Tzipora has a thick tangle of curly hair, and needs a comb to tame particularly bad curls.</li>
<li><strong>Cool Rocks</strong>: What are you supposed to do? Leave the cool rock on the ground? How would you show it to others?</li>
<li><strong>Lip Balm</strong>: For emergencies.</li>
</ul>

<p>This illustration accompanies an essay, called <a href="/social-economy/"><em>A Social Economy</em></a>. It was written as an introduction to Vekllei&rsquo;s essential premise &ndash; its moneyless economy. It is about as brief as I can make it, but it is also a work in progress that can hopefully be updated in future, as I refine not just the ideas involved but how I communicate them.</p>
<p>Moneylessness is maybe the most fantastical aspect of Vekllei, and so it is particularly interesting to me. I&rsquo;m well aware it&rsquo;s a bit crazy, but taking it seriously and engaging with it is the joy of this project. My drawings help depict what a society based on these ideas might look like. All these things contribute to Vekllei&rsquo;s immersive and unique qualities.</p>

<p>Airships have seen some resurgence in the mid-21st Century as an alternate means of air travel, occupying a travel niche somewhere between the ocean-liner and a passenger jet. Although relatively uncommon compared to fixed-wing aircraft, airships do fly busy routes in certain parts of the world where their capacity and leisurely speeds are preferred.</p>
<p>In <a style="color: var(--color-millmint)" href="/vekllei/"><span class="fi fi-com"></span> Vekllei</a>, all passenger airships are operated by <a href="/air/">Commonwealth Airways</a>. Airships can dock without a runway, making them ideal for Vekllei&rsquo;s many archipelagos and Caribbean island belts, where they are most commonly seen. There are daily airship routes between Kalina&rsquo;s republics, the Bahamas, and between the Verde, Mira and Azores Commonwealths. Other routes link Vekllei&rsquo;s remote islands weekly, or commute passengers between Oslola and Kala. International routes are also common, especially to the US and UK. Since airships can only fly in certain weather, their routes are often seasonal.</p>
<p>The smallest Vekllei airship, CNV <em>Astrid</em> has a capacity of just twenty-six. The largest, pictured here, is the CNV <em>Comet</em> with capacity for nearly 500 people. With helidocks, internal elevators and a sky-lounge with panoramic windows, Vekllei&rsquo;s larger airships are a far cry from the gondola-balloons of yesteryear. In total, there are 16 airships in service with Commonwealth Airways. They are machines of enormous prestige, and they carry the Commonwealth flag wherever they go.</p>
<p>The largest airship in Vekllei service, however, belongs to the Vekllei Air Force. Originally a command centre that could spend the summer months over the Arctic circle, it is undergoing conversion to become a flying aircraft carrier.</p>

<p>Tzipora was a picture of integration, because she wanted badly for people to respect her. She also felt she owed something to the country which had lifted her up and given her a quality of life. She had no prospects before coming to Oslola, so she practiced gratitude in everything she did &ndash; sometimes out loud.</p>
<p>Lin Zhi was not a picture of integration; Lin Zhi was a black box. She barely spoke English &ndash; the common language of Vekllei&rsquo;s immigrant society and international schools. A lot of the English she did speak came in short, sharp barks. Her severe disposition was well known at <a href="/moshel/">Moshel St School</a>. They were paired together in gardening class, and Tzipora learned soon enough that Lin Zhi was not so much rude as she was quiet and isolated, and did not trust or like her peers.</p>
<p>Tzipora was terrible at making friends, but not because she was out of tune with people&rsquo;s feelings. She knew Zhi was a private person instinctively, and so she did not ask her questions or force conversation except to plant crops and water ferns. Zhi in turn became used to her and they developed silent routines in class.</p>
<p>When Tzipora broke her arm a few months later, Zhi asked how she broke it, without looking up from the soil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was playing tennis and fell on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Lin Zhi laughed once.</p>

<p>Seispri is one of the older neighbourhoods in <a href="/lola/">Lola</a>. It is situated on the hills above the historic capital of Reykjavic, and retains its medieval character and chaotic, vernacular architecture. It feels lived-in and worn from a thousand years of commerce.</p>
<p>It used to be an upmarket neighbourhood, prior to the Atomic War in 1995. Today it is tired and cramped, after its slipshod reconstruction in the early postwar years. Seispri has a large community of immigrant Jews from Southern Europe, and has large populations of Greeks and Albanians too. They give this old place new life and character.</p>
<p>To Tzipora, Seispri was her home. Vekllei did not spend much time thinking about the past these days. This moment lived for the future.</p>

<h2 id="tzipora-the-platform-attendant">
  Tzipora the Platform Attendant
  <a class="anchor" href="#tzipora-the-platform-attendant">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Tzipora was a train enthusiast &ndash; of course she was, you somehow knew that looking at her. She was a member of the <em>Vekllei Rail Association</em>, and worked a couple days a month as a platform attendant. It was part hobby and part job. She had training in first aid and disability services, and so she helped Commonwealth National Rail &ndash; she rode the trains around giving timetable advice and assisting disabled passengers board and alight trains.</p>
<p>She had been shilling the Rail Association to her friends, but none of them shared her enthusiasm for train travel. The exception was Coretti, who joined because she was dating Tzipora&rsquo;s friend, Moise, and was trying to know her better. They were employed by CNR in an unusual legal framework as &ldquo;associate employees,&rdquo; or volunteers. These jobs are common in Vekllei, where work is play and volunteerism is beat into them.</p>
<h2 id="uniform-notes">
  Uniform Notes
  <a class="anchor" href="#uniform-notes">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Commonwealth National Rail employs nearly 40,000 people and has many uniforms. Both Tzipora and Coretti wear white gloves, which is a recent addition. You are supposed to wear them if you are going to touch people, since there are now many immigrants in Vekllei and not all of them are as comfortable as Oslolans being touched or pushed by service staff.</p>
<p>Both Coretti and Tzipora are wearing their ordinary shoes and school skirts. The practical colours of their school uniform allow a single navy skirt, white shirt or pair of leather shoes to be useful in many different roles in society, reducing waste.</p>
<h2 id="civic-associations-in-vekllei">
  Civic Associations in Vekllei
  <a class="anchor" href="#civic-associations-in-vekllei">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Three types of civic association exist in Vekllei.</p>
<ol>
<li>Labour Syndicates: organised labour in enterprises that are not democratised. Most commonly, these apply to small and medium-sized businesses.</li>
<li>Policy Advocates: special-interest policy groups that are expressly political.</li>
<li>Councils: organised associations of people with something in common.</li>
</ol>
<p>What all have them in common is that they are <em>organised</em>; they have a leadership structure, and keep records. Similar organisations exist in many other countries, but Commonwealth <em>councils</em> are unique in their ubiquity and power in society. Their interests range from Polish cultural groups to academic associations and, indeed, railroad employees and enthusiasts.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that work is primarily social in Vekllei and consequently it does not occupy the same role in people&rsquo;s lives. Few Vekllei jobs simply &ldquo;clock in, clock out.&rdquo; Instead, there is a vast sea of semi-professionalised labour that exists somewhere between employment and hobbyism. It is in this context that councils proliferate, and force a reconsideration of how we think about work.</p>
<p>Large companies have large associate councils. These are not integrated directly &ndash; they exist voluntarily, as congregations of enthusiasts. Commonwealth Airways has several associate councils with which it engages and does business, including the Student Pilots Association No. 1184, Commonwealth Air Enthusiasts No. 622, Atlantic Model Aeroplane Association No. 646, Air Doctors Social Club No. 801, Women in Flight No. 340, and many others.</p>
<p>Councils are a means to engage with customers, provide employees with social and recreational opportunities, and solicit ideas and labour from enthusiasts. Consequently, there are millions of Vekllei people who have semi-professional gigs on the side. These councils, in turn, provide avenues for employment and a means to socialise with like-minded people. They also contribute representatives to the civic ecclesia<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> of a local area, and thus advise local government. They are often fickle, schismatic, and poorly organised &ndash; but they&rsquo;re social organisations, and are afforded those shortcomings.</p>
<p>Other types of council might represent Islamic interests in a city, or Lithuanian culture. Others organise amateur bakers. Their diversity allows for a kind of organising not represented by labour unions or political associations, and validate a variety of interests in the function of democratic government.</p>
<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>A civic ecclesia is an advisory body of citizens in a <a href="/polis/">local administration</a>. It consists of notable citizens in good standing, cultural groups and representatives from Councils.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Tzipora was a foreigner. It was hard to pick out a distinct cultural background amidst her school uniform and wardrobe of modest, secular dailywear, which is typical of Vekllei. But she was a foreigner, and on a few days a year, when she wore her only party dress, you remembered that fact.</p>
<p>It is easy to lose track of who comes from where in Vekllei. About half of people were born overseas, and the other half have history in one of a dozen scattered republics that make up the country. It is a deeply multicultural society, a fact which is treasured and protected by the Commonwealth government.</p>
<p>At school, they wore the same uniforms every day, which made seeing your classmates at the end-of-term formal a shock. People you thought had lived here all their lives showed up in gowns of styles you&rsquo;d never seen. And here was Tzipora, previously known as an Italian, a Gypsy, an Indian or whatever else they guessed of her, now revealed to be Colombian &ndash; as she always had been.</p>
<!--In general, the centralisation of textiles and clothing manufacturers in Vekllei has had the effect of obscuring ethnicity. The Commonwealth has no common race, language or culture. Instead, it is a country by values and circumstance. This is a market that offers everyone basically the same department stores with the same styles of clothes, whether your family has been here for two weeks or a thousand years. The wardrobes of Vekllei people are filled with modest dailywear and something nice for church or occasions, which has the effect of reifying the appearance of society.

To clarify, when we talk about dressing people 'basically the same,' we do not imply literal uniforms as found in their schools or something comparable to the 'Mao-suit' -- department stores offer a million items in many styles. But they are all *commonwealth* styles, in a vision of the *democratic* man and woman, and so they do not contribute to the diverse cultural clothing background of Vekllei's disparate republics. That is not to say that traditional or cultural clothing does not exist (it is common) or that it is suppressed (it isn't) -- just that this state of affairs is convenient for a new country eager to celebrate a shared, civic identity in which any man filled with the democratic spirit can gain citizenship.-->

<p>Clockwise:</p>
<p>Cobian is an Algic girl, which means she&rsquo;s indigenous to Iceland in my world, which is called Oslola. She comes from a mixed indigenous Arctic background. Her mother is kind of crazy and Cobian is a bit insecure, but she&rsquo;s very close with Tzipora. They drift between friends and girlfriends, it&rsquo;s complicated.</p>
<p>Coretti is Afro-Russian. Even though she was born in Congo (sometimes called Zaire in my world) she grew up in the USSR and immigrated to Oslola later on. She&rsquo;s very patient and graceful, and is dating Tzipora&rsquo;s best friend Moise.</p>
<p>Lin Zhi is Chinese and always goes by her full name. She doesn&rsquo;t speak much of their language and she&rsquo;s kind of a hothead so she&rsquo;s a bit of a mystery to them. But Tzipora attracts eccentric characters and Lin Zhi doesn&rsquo;t have any other friends so she hangs out with them.</p>
<p>Finally, Tzipora (being held) is the main character of the story. Her mother was Spanish Roma and her father was Yiddish. She&rsquo;s very friendly but intense and she&rsquo;s sort of the focus point which the friendship group is centred around. She&rsquo;s got more going on with her (she doesn&rsquo;t live with her parents and how she came to Vekllei is ambiguous) but she&rsquo;s just trying her best.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/hispanic.jpg"/> <p>By November 2059, America was in an uneasy peace. The lease of nuclear sites &ldquo;essential for continental strategic security&rdquo; had been secured by Washington the previous month, and the June ceasefire was still in place despite a border skirmish that killed half a dozen GIs not far from where Tzipora was, in Southwest Utah.</p>
<p>The Dallas Administration, which was at this point calling itself the American War Government, was using the ceasefire to lick its wounds and negotiate with state militias to form a central command. The romance of a grassroots revolt, risen in a frenzy of rage and opportunity, had worn off. Now, the secessionist regions were digging in for serious fighting.</p>
<p>The quality of life varied between states. In Texas, things were better, but the borders had been closed. In Utah, things were collapsing. There was not much money around and the government in Salt Lake had lost control over their army. In towns like Cherry, police and soldiers worked together to maintain order or murder and rob; whichever took their fancy that day.</p>
<p>Tzipora knew she was at risk, but her options were limited. She lived and worked at Hotel Cairo (formerly Hotel Zion), which was a ways out of town. Most of the other girls had gone home or fled the state months ago, so there was plenty of work. No one else would employ aliens. She did not yet have enough money to make it to the East Coast, which would require bribing pretty much everyone she met along the way. The journey was dangerous, too &ndash; the busses had stopped and the trains weren&rsquo;t running, so you had to walk. There were a lot of violent drifters just moving through these days.</p>
<p>Come November 2059, it was obvious her time was running out. Posters had gone up announcing all &lsquo;Hispanics&rsquo; &ndash; a term here meaning people that looked like they came from Mexico or further south, not just spanish-speakers &ndash; were to be evacuated from the border. Neighbouring Nevada was a Washington-controlled state, and there would certainly be fighting in Utah. Ostensibly they were worried Latinos had more allegiance to the United States than to Dallas. More likely they just wanted them gone.</p>
<p>The posters said they would be evacuated to Colorado City, but Tzipora figured that was a crock of shit. That was a free city; they wouldn&rsquo;t take foreigners, and especially not people like her. She didn&rsquo;t know where they would send her but she didn&rsquo;t like it. It was not just rumours; Tzipora knew foreigners were being picked off the streets. Dallas was talking about saving the &ldquo;free states&rdquo; from &ldquo;Despotism &amp; Outsider Agitants,&rdquo; and Tzipora looked like an Outsider Agitant.</p>
<p>Hotel Cairo was outside of the evacuation zone, but she would have to carry her work-residence papers everywhere she went now. She just needed to save her cash; the US Dollar was a magical thing. In times like these, it bought comfort, security and opportunity. Staying was a gamble, but what choice did someone like her have? The Dollar was the great equaliser; it was life itself.</p>

They did not want the kids playing there because there was no telling how many unmarked graves remained or what might rise to the surface in the rains.</p>

<p>Despite having many consumer products, Vekllei is not a consumer society and is not equipped to succeed as one. Benevolent state monopolies produce staple goods &ndash; food, clothing, and shelter &ndash; and everything else is left up to the anarchic participatory industriousness of its people, which is situated somewhere between a productive free market and chaos.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These planned production mechanisms facilitate the reliable overproduction of essential goods that meet the needs of Vekllei population. The inflexibility of this system is supplanted by the private market of participatory labour, which produces the majority of consumer goods and products in Vekllei, if unreliably. Luxury goods are generally hyperlocalised or imported, and are scarce for most Veklei people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ndash; <a href="/assets/">State Assets of Vekllei</a></p>
<p>Since the staples of Vekllei life are produced in an inflexible planned system based on overproduction, the most common place of &lsquo;commerce&rsquo; for ordinary Vekllei people is the department store. They are a feature of the country, capable of furnishing a complete life out of simple and quality goods. Furniture, clothing, some appliances, and all types of food are available. Clothing is of high quality, and has some variety of essential fashions in contemporary society.</p>
<p>These department stores resemble the icons of consumer societies overseas, but without an efficient means of exchange to build real markets built on capital, the mechanisms to develop a consumer culture are absent. Instead, Vekllei is full of &lsquo;ghost consumers;&rsquo; people participating in consumer rituals that look like their counterparts overseas, but missing the critical aspects of consumer desire and money-value.</p>
<p>Indeed, Tzipora was surprised when Cobian took her to the Montvisiosn Department Store one day to &lsquo;shop&rsquo; for new clothes. Cobian tried things on and frowned at herself in the mirror like the Yanquis and Londoners and Parisians do, but she was really acting out what she saw in films. It was a fantasy; a child&rsquo;s idea of shopping and consumption and commerce. It was very exotic to Vekllei people, but Tzipora had lived overseas and knew the difference money-value made. There was no real desire to consume; it was a social ritual without a financial basis. They might as well have been doing each other&rsquo;s hair in the park, or trying on her mother&rsquo;s shoes.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/tannin.jpg"/> <p>Broad mossy meadows slope away from Vekllei&rsquo;s &ldquo;ashen lands&rdquo; &ndash; vast, glacial moonscapes in the highland interior. The soils here are rich with nitrogen, and are dominated by an alpine heathland of <em>button grass</em> and <em>tea shrubs</em>. The oils from these plants seep downstream into the glacial runoff, and by the time the water meets the mosslands the creeks are stained tea-coloured, a mix of reds and yellows that catches gold in the light. These are Vekllei&rsquo;s tannin rivers; rusty freshwater streams that run red from the base of the Thanveler glacier to the outskirts of Antarta and Dasm.</p>
<p>The mosses here are thick and dewey, and Tzipora&rsquo;s house sandals did nothing to keep her out of them. With her feet soaked and her school bag on the station platform, she dared Cobian and Zhi to leap the tannin river. Local myth was that it was good luck, but she&rsquo;d have jumped it anyway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m good at jumping,&rdquo; Tzipors said to her friends, wiping her cold nose on the back of her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to go in that bloody river and you&rsquo;ll be soaked for the train home,&rdquo; Cobian said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I make it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She squelched a few steps backwards, squinting at the amber creek ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch this.&rdquo;</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/ross.jpg"/> <p>The so-called <em>Scandinationalists</em> have a thousand years of myth in their pamphlets, but are in reality a product of the Atomic War. Racial nationalism has existed in Vekllei for centuries, but was only legitimised as a modern political force by the pre-war junta and materialised as violence by its collapse in the days after the Atomic War. Exploited grievances, hundreds in number but all basically the same, overflowed in the chaos of the war and saw savage criminal instincts acted on by militias called <em>Stanis</em>.</p>
<p>The Stanis were put down by the British occupying forces, but they persist as terror cells. The Floral Government recognises their ideology as criminal, and so any organising around it is simply not tolerated. When you hear of Noshem, the Vekllei intelligence service, killing foreigners in kitchens and bedrooms, it is usually to these ends.</p>
<p>This state of affairs is complicated and often undemocratic, but the thinking is straightforward. The 4th Commonwealth is a multiracial state of disparate, autonomous republics. Nearly half of its population was born overseas, and it recognises its indigenous Algic and Scandinavian populations as a single cultural group. This unity is fragile, and so action in defence of it has to be uncompromising as a matter of routine. To pick up a rifle, or place a bomb, or assist scandinationalist elements is a death sentence served outside of the courts, in a way that privileges this form of terrorism above other terrorist ideologies. This is not just a matter of opinion; this is policy. Anything else is insufficient, so says the state, because the alternative is evidenced by what happened in 2005.</p>
<p>Ross Gosmiosn was sent to Home Office Section 12 from Section 2. In civilian speak, this meant he was moved from organisation security to the operations command, to work under their solemn new director Baron Desmoisnes, who was well-regarded at the Home Office after his successes at the Americas Bureau.</p>
<p>Baron&rsquo;s promotion from a captain in the Americas Bureau to a HO/NI Section Chief was not particularly unusual for a longtime intelligence agent, but it was obviously strategic. He had a record of hunting former Stanis in Central and North America, and had good contacts at AB/NI. His promotion to HO/NI indicated that his talents were needed at home; that the Home Office was looking to put down emerging threats in Vekllei. Ross knew this when he arrived at Section 12. It was confirmed by his first conversation with Baron in Winter 2063.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Ross?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Director.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been recommended you by Alvi, who said you&rsquo;d served in Africa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you have some tactical experience?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Twice in Africa, and some time in the Rifles, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The algae and silica in the water is good for your skin, and has antibacterial properties. The riverbed at Moshel St School consists of black sand and nectarine-sized stones which press the arch of her foot. In her hands, the milky blue water is opaque and salty to taste. There is no other place on Earth with a school like this.</p>

<p>On the left is Ms Zora Ninƒçiƒá, and on the right Mr Kowalczyk. Students joke that they must be brother and sister because they look similar, but they&rsquo;re unrelated. Ms Ninƒçiƒá teaches social sciences, and Mr Kowalczyk teaches chemistry.</p>
<p>Tzipora is a somewhat poor student, but she is well-loved by these teachers, and they go above and beyond in helping Tzipora muster the grades she&rsquo;ll need to go on to university. She is very grateful to them.</p>
<p>There are rumours Mr Kowalczyk has a crush on Ms Ninƒçiƒá.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I based Kowalczyk off Steve Gadd, my favourite session drummer of all time, and Ninƒçiƒá off a woman who sold me a bus ticket in croatia, who had this wild curly hair afro but looked Slavic.
It&rsquo;s also an example of teachers wearing similar uniforms (in their case, more of a dress code) to students.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/uk.jpg"/> <p>The <a href="/stories/japan/">last time I made one of these</a>, it was January 2020. When I got back, the news was just starting to talk about a new disease outbreak in China.</p>
<p>It is striking to me that the shitty drawing attached to that post was the last time I went overseas. On an abstract level I can understand it&rsquo;s been two years &ndash; but wow, that drawing puts things in perspective. And since that post, I&rsquo;ve been stuck in my house in Hobart, occasionally visiting other parts of my beautiful island state of Tasmania. That&rsquo;s a long time in the history of this project, and a long time for someone who found inspiration to draw from travelling.</p>
<p>Grounded no more. I am currently in Oxford in the U.K., and will be somewhere else soon. I&rsquo;ll let you know where I&rsquo;m going next.</p>
<p><em>Stories from the Horizon</em> is proceeding as normal, but I&rsquo;m spending a bit more time creating new styles of architecture inspired by my surrounds. Vekllei is always evolving, and it&rsquo;s evolving especially fast right now. When I&rsquo;ve left the U.K. in a few days, I&rsquo;ll write an article about my experience with pictures attached to the <a href="/news/blog/">millmint.net blog</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having such a great time and learning so much.</p>
<p>Best,</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/puffin.jpg"/> <p>The <em>Scouts de Vous Seispri Votaisre</em> (lit. Scouts Interior Spirit Corps) is a corps of the Commonwealth Army, modelled after the worldwide scouting association. This unusual intersection &ndash; of a noncombatant youth organisation and the armed forces &ndash; is typical in Vekllei, where many aspects of the military serve social roles. For example, the Vekllei Fire Service and the <a href="/mail/">Royal Mail</a> are both corps of the Commonwealth Army. To this end, the Scouts Corps (better known as <em>Puffin Scouts</em> overseas) has different traditions depending on which brigade it belongs to. The detached Cadet Brigades of the 1st and 2nd Scouting Divisions are youth training organisations for the armed forces, designed to prepare youths for military service. The rest of the brigades, numbering some 12 in total across 2 Divisions (or some 1,460 neighbourhood troops) are decidedly noncombatant, and exist to provide community and training in useful skills for Vekllei&rsquo;s youth.</p>
<p>Tzipora naturally belongs to <em>Scouts de Seispri</em>, her local troop. As a military branch, the Scouts follow identical organisational conventions, and so Tzipora has &rsquo;enlisted&rsquo; alongside other servicemen in the Commonwealth Army:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Civici Tzipora Desmoisnes, 77th Troop, 7th <em>Lola</em> District, 1st <em>Vekllei</em> Scouts Brigade of the 1st Scouts Division</p>
</blockquote>
<p>

</blockquote>
</p>
<p>It functions as a social club &ndash; many of her schoolmates are in it &ndash; and also provides an opportunity to learn things outside of the school curriculum. Survival skills and camping, agriculture, hunting and weapons handling, driving, and amateur radio operation are common excursions. Some troops have particular reputations, and are highly desirable &ndash; 588th Troop of the 3rd Brigade has a legendary reputation in photo-electrics and computer phreaking. The 77th is a little more local in ambition, and Tzipora spends most of her time teaching the others to cook and gardening around Seispri.</p>
<p>Instead of merit badges, scouts earn honours that are stitched to a <a href="/stories/crown/#the-gi">gi</a>. Significant honours &ndash; usually success in national competitions or academic awards &ndash; can also be transferred to troop honours, in the fashion of battle honours for combat army corps. The Scouts uniform has many coded features of army dress uniforms, including its Sam Browne belt (sloped left for Civici, right for officers), epaulettes with honours, cloth aiguillette, and troop patches. Tzipora doesn&rsquo;t wear all that every Thursday obviously &ndash; but it matters at the Games, when her honours are on display and she&rsquo;s trying to show those dicks in the 76th they&rsquo;re dealing with a better class of scout.</p>

  Genesis of Utopia
  <a class="anchor" href="#genesis-of-utopia">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Vekllei did not originate in <a href="/lola/">Lola</a> &ndash; according to the <em>Saga of Origins</em>, Vekllei emerged from the corpse of a petty creator god named <em>Oslola</em>. But there was some truth in casting Lola as the genesis of the Vekllei nation-state, since this is where Scandinavian settlers first landed over three thousand years ago, and was where the 1st and 2nd Commonwealths consolidated their power and united the Vekllei Islands.</p>
<p>In its peak, Lola was a colonial metropole that rivalled any of the European capitals in wealth and monument. It was the jewel of the 3rd Commonwealth &ndash; the military government &ndash; and retained the splendid summer palaces and elaborate roman baths of the old monarchies.</p>
<p>

<blockquote class="hint caption">

  <div class="text">Flag of the borough of <a href="/lola/">Lola</a>.</div>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>The war destroyed Lola and its ancient capital district, Reykjavic. Two 5 megaton fission bombs struck near its harbour, and the blasts rushed up its surrounding plains and steep hills, poisoning its earth with radiation and wiping clean a thousand years of history. Nearly 500,000 people died.</p>
<p>One genesis folds into another; the 4th Commonwealth, the &lsquo;Floral Government&rsquo; of democracy and gentleness, was founded in its ashes. The new Vekllei has a new capital, and with it has moved its commerce and shipping. The new Lola, still lush with ruins and roofless homes, has been relieved of the burden of wealth. The borough has emerged as a home for immigrants, particularly Yiddish, Irish and Poles. They are building a new life in Lola; they are building a new Lola.</p>
<h2 id="an-essential-journey">
  An Essential Journey
  <a class="anchor" href="#an-essential-journey">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Tzipora lived in Lola with Baron. Baron was an institutionalised person and had spend many years overseas, and government realtors had reclaimed his apartment. When he returned to Vekllei for good, he moved into a late uncle&rsquo;s apartment in the tired neighbourhood of Seispri, a terraced community of light industry, workshops and immigrant families.</p>
<p>Seispri was Tzipora&rsquo;s first home in Vekllei, and would always be close to her heart. It was a different kind of living to what she knew. Vekllei people were much poorer in some ways, but the quality of their lives was much better. There was a real sense of contributing to a different way of living; of improving their lot honestly; of shared burdens. Many immigrants to Vekllei arrived to participate in this project &ndash; whether they were Labour Zionists or Pan-Atlanticists, they all had their reasons for being here and made good use of their lives.</p>
<p>Baron&rsquo;s apartment was above a garage and down the road from a canvas factory, but the houses were full of families with children. That was very nice, to see kids playing in the street. A creek ran behind the street, and you could catch little fish there sometimes.</p>
<p>Tzipora was a shadow of a girl by the time she finished high school. She was not good at anything in particular and did not have an immediate interest in university. Unresolved memories of the past were lurking in her mind&rsquo;s periphery, and she was starting to worry they would kill her if she thought too long or too hard. On different days she felt her friends were leaving her behind or that she was holding them back. She was unravelling.</p>
<p>Rather than implode in Seispri, she decided she would renew her vows to the country she loved by touring its entirety on foot. This was actually a very old Vekllei tradition called the <em>Visa Con</em>, or &lsquo;private pilgrimage.&rsquo; Like many such traditions, it was once a spiritual practice that has secularised in the postwar period. Tzipora had made her way from California to Utah on foot &ndash; so what was a hundred boroughs? She was good at walking.</p>
<p>Cobian had graduated school with good marks and had started a nursing residency at a Lola clinic. Tzipora had made up her mind quickly about the whole thing and wanted to say her goodbyes before she left. She called the clinic and met Cobian down by the tram station, near the busy heart of Seispri. It was nice here; the sun was out. They talked for a long while and held hands. After Tzipora said her goodbyes and Cobian had said her well-wishes they asked a passing girl to take their picture.</p>

  A New Format for Stories from Vekllei
  <a class="anchor" href="#a-new-format-for-stories-from-vekllei">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Vekllei has <a href="/boroughs/">one hundred boroughs</a> that are usually characterised as the foundation of the Vekllei city-state. Some, like Bakur, have only a few thousand people in them. Others, like the Great Coast, have over a million.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on this project for a while now, about five years counting backwards, and in that time what Vekllei means to me has matured. In some ways, things have calcified &ndash; a gift and a curse &ndash; but it&rsquo;s also true that the project is more complicated now than it ever was. I think it&rsquo;s more sophisticated, and it reflects a more complete person.</p>
<p>For a long time now, Vekllei has existed first as a series of pictures with stories attached &ndash; this very format you&rsquo;re reading now, which number about 315 posts since 2017. They&rsquo;re all on this site, check them out. Today, I&rsquo;m announcing <em>Stories from the Horizon</em>, a new approach to this format that will depict Vekllei&rsquo;s 100 boroughs in a series of 100 landscape pictures, woven together as a great journey featuring Tzipora.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2066, Tzipora is drifting between moments. Since high school, nothing has really worked out the way she&rsquo;d hoped &ndash; not university, not work, and not love. She is waiting for the shape of her life to make sense. The past seems further away and more relevant than ever before, and her future is uncertain. Rather than confront these things directly, she meets the universe on her terms, and starts a journey in the great Vekllei tradition &ndash; the <em>Visa Con</em>, or Private Pilgrimage. The Visa Con is a winding path throughout the island of Vekllei, reaching all corners of its great Atlantic landscapes. It is a testament to the goodness of living in this world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Stories from the Horizon</em> isn&rsquo;t the upcoming &lsquo;Vekllei comic,&rsquo; but it will help me create it. The comic is a big deal for me, and it&rsquo;s forced me to rethink many aspects of how I depict Vekllei. Five years since the first Vekllei post, I&rsquo;m replacing the burden of an established format with the lightness of being a beginner again. These stories will resemble the posts you&rsquo;re familiar with, but will be more considerate in how they depict landscape and architecture in Vekllei, and will altogether produce a really important album of Vekllei landscapes that I can draw on for future projects. You&rsquo;ll notice some of my online presence changing to reflect this &ndash; new banners for social media and that sort of thing. Who knows, maybe <em>Stories from the Horizon</em> could be turned into a little picture-book when it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be fast &ndash; pictures will (probably) come out at the same pace as they do now (I want to make them faster, I really do, I&rsquo;m always trying). It won&rsquo;t be consistent &ndash; I&rsquo;ll still want to do other concepts occasionally. And I can&rsquo;t guarantee they&rsquo;ll all be good. But I want to enjoy doing something new, from a new perspective and spirit, and I hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy it too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved journeys, so let&rsquo;s see where this takes us.</p>

</h2>
<p>The <em>gi</em> is a women&rsquo;s &lsquo;quarter-pleat,&rsquo; and is one of several styles of separated &lsquo;pleats&rsquo; used in Vekllei traditional dress. It consists of a strip of fabric about the width of a leg, stitched with <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language/#rapotenne">Rapotenne</a> runes to communicate familial or spiritual heritage.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Traditionally gi were worn to the hem length of traditional skirts (at the ankle), but have shortened with skirt fashions in modernity. Similarly, many modern gi use regular <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language/#topet">Topet</a> in place of Rapotenne, which signals a cultural shift of their use away from spiritual artefacts towards secular cultural items. The popularity of the gi today is the result of their use in uniforms in education and some professions, introducing the practice and style to Vekllei&rsquo;s large immigrant populations and ensuring the gi&rsquo;s survival into the Floral Period. Gi mostly remain formal or ceremonial wear for special occasions, but are seeing some limited use in modern fashions.</p>

<p>Most Vekllei people do not own a television, so they go to movie theatres. Even though personal appliances are abundant in the U.S. and Europe, they are in constant shortage for almost all classes of Vekllei people, and so the social tradition of the cinema is alive and well. Most people visit a few times a week for films and the news.</p>
<p>Like television, the programming depends on the time of day. After school finishes at 2pm, the movies are playing stuff for kids. After the work-day finishes at 4pm, they play normal films and television programmes. 6pm is the news &ndash; Tzipora always tried to catch the news &ndash; usually followed by a documentary. And afterwards came the feature films, which ran late into the night.</p>
<p>Tzipora, Moise and Isabeau are finishing pre-movie drinks in the ruins of <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/lola/">Lola</a>, surrounded by night-shadows and stars. Ruins are common all over Vekllei, but no kids gave much thought to them. To them, the war was already history. This time of year, the moon has been up for hours. A science fiction movie Tzipora has been wanting to see again plays at the <em>Royal</em> tonight.</p>
<p>It was legal to drink as a 16-year-old in Vekllei, but it didn&rsquo;t mean it wasn&rsquo;t a hassle. Just as they do overseas, most Vekllei teenagers drink together in the private corners of public places, away from parents and the local nuisances, the lights of Copetpek glowing beneath them.</p>

  A Uniform for All Seasons

<p>Vekllei students are internationally renowned for their elegant and, in places, decadent uniforms. This reputation is built on an open-ended, modular uniform system that can be distilled into a simple assemblage of white, navy, gold and red. The spoken guidelines and unspoken curation of the Vekllei uniform system contributes to the variety and personality of Vekllei studentry, and is iconic of the country overseas.</p>
<p>Most distinctive is the silhouette of the school cape, an accessory that remains in fashion in 21st-Century Vekllei. Vekllei experiences dramatic seasons, and the modularity and comfort of a wool-rayon cape suits the temperamental climate well. It can be unfastened in warmer weather, or pulled tight as a greatcoat. A rayon hood can be snapped and tied over its over-slip to make it waterproof, and the cape is easily folded and stored in classrooms.</p>
<p>Vekllei uniforms are designed to be lived in, and so items like shirts and shoes come off the rack of a department store. Capes are also seen outside of school, and are worn broadly throughout Vekllei society. This quirk of culture and climate contributes significantly to Vekllei&rsquo;s obscurity abroad and further demonstrates the inscrutability of Vekllei society. Sun-facing but cautious of the future, Vekllei is a place of anachronisms and emerging ways of living. The wealth of their schools is the wealth of their future, and so dignity and equity are deeply valued in Vekllei education.</p>
<h2 id="a-cape-for-all-hours">
  A Cape for All Hours
  <a class="anchor" href="#a-cape-for-all-hours">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Tzipora fell asleep in her cape after school sometimes. She did not sleep much in the night so she found times throughout the day, where the fatigue took her. She was not fussy about the proper way of doing things, and was openly contemptuous of (some) traditions and (some) social graces. Cobian was her opposite. She had a structured, stable lifestyle that had flossing and bedtimes. Tzipora didn&rsquo;t usually change for dinner, and if her paperback was good, sometimes she just crawled under the duvet and went to sleep in her school clothes, her cape on the floor. Cobian hated that way of living but liked that she was like that.</p>

  Little Hyderabad

<p>Little Hyderabad is a community in the Great Coast, and is one of the few remaining ethnic enclaves in Vekllei&rsquo;s postwar period. It&rsquo;s not that immigrants are rare &ndash; on the contrary, about half the people you see in the street were born overseas. But the chaos of British occupation was far behind them now, and the government is more considerate in how it scatters immigrants across the boroughs. These dense concentrations of people and culture are rarer today, and that made Little Hyderabad (Petty Hyderabad, in Vekllei pidgin) both intimidating and exotic to girls like Tzipora, who liked people and adventure.</p>
<p>Tzipora had eaten Indian food once before. She had been tricked by some girl &ndash; her friend at the time &ndash; into trying a mystery beef dish doped with a criminal mix of spices. That girl thought it was funny at first, but Tzipora started crying. Her hands went numb and she thought she was going to die. She didn&rsquo;t brag about her &lsquo;Colombian spice tolerance&rsquo; so much after that.</p>
<p>She was staying over at Ayn&rsquo;s apartment in the Great Coast when she decided to visit Little Hyderabad, if only for a convenient dinner when Ayn worked late. She wasn&rsquo;t quite sure what to expect. The neighbourhood was lighted enough and quite low-rise for the Great Coast, but most of the apartments had been built in Occupation and so were tired and sagging in places. She liked that, <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/lola/#seispri">Seispri</a> was the same. There was this place called the Palace Restaurant which wasn&rsquo;t really a restaurant at all, but a hole in the wall with someone&rsquo;s mum sitting in it. It smelled good &ndash; really good, but there were these two big Sikh guys chatting casually with her like they knew her. Tzipora sat on the curb and watched them until they left a while later.</p>
<p>She went up to the mum and looked into the gloom for a board with the menu on it. There wasn&rsquo;t one. The mum asked what kind of curry she liked. Tzipora said she didn&rsquo;t know. Well &ndash; how spicy did she like it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Medium &ndash; please,&rdquo; Tzipora said.</p>
<p>It came in a wood bowl that was hot to the touch. She ate it in the street and was nearly struck by a guy on a petrol bike. The taste was so big &ndash; it filled your mouth, lighting up all corners of your brain with pleasure. This wasn&rsquo;t like curry from the tin &ndash; it was fresh, and earthy, and foreign-tasting. She was hooked. And smugly, it wasn&rsquo;t that spicy at all. <em>How&rsquo;s that for spice tolerance</em>, she thought to herself.</p>

  A Note on Caf√©s in Vekllei
  <a class="anchor" href="#a-note-on-caf%c3%a9s-in-vekllei">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Society in Vekllei is not particularly more altruistic than anywhere else, so why do people run restaurants in a place with no money? There are a few reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>In Vekllei, land (in part) owns itself, and historical use of the land is generally preserved in transfers of ownership. In practice, this means that a parcel of land with a caf√© also comes with an apartment or cottage attached. These establishments are often central both geographically and socially, and so are highly desirable pieces of real estate. While it is possible to convert a caf√© into a different business, land-ownership is complex in Vekllei and usually goes through the courts. You&rsquo;ll require either the backing of the municipality or the sovereign (the extrapolated &lsquo;best interest&rsquo; of the land metaphysic) to make major renovations to a business, so that renovation is not something to rely on when looking for property.</li>
<li>Eateries are easy to establish. The Vekllei equivalent of a &lsquo;business loan&rsquo; occurs through a meeting with the <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/interior/commerce/#petty-bureau-labour-bank-of-vekllei">Sisterbank</a> (officially <em>Petty Bureau Labour Bank of Vekllei</em>), which is driven by the social good in abstract. Food service is a mature industry with straightforward connections to suppliers, so almost anyone can start an eatery after a few meetings with the bank. Food businesses also scale well &ndash; evidence of good trade allows you to take out greater loans easily, and unlocks options for both your establishment and your living situation.</li>
<li>People like doing it. Vekllei is made up of hundreds of thousands of small communities, and a caf√©, bistro or pub is at the heart of all of them. It&rsquo;s a romantic sort of business that requires hard work, but offers satisfying social rewards &ndash; Vekllei people value property stewardship, graciousness and community, and a restauranteur is positioned at the centre of all three. The most well-liked members in many communities are barmen and bakers.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are all optimistic reasons why people run eateries in Vekllei. It is also true that some hate doing it, but continue regardless &ndash; paralysed either by attachment to the location or a legacy or some other social or legal trap. There&rsquo;s plenty of bad food in Vekllei, too. The overall density of caf√©s in the country is however something to marvel at, and you&rsquo;ll notice it immediately upon arrival.</p>
<h3 id="a-funny-appetite">
  A Funny Appetite
  <a class="anchor" href="#a-funny-appetite">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Tzipora had a difficult relationship with eating, and by the time she got to Vekllei her hunger was all over the place. It was something to do with the psychology of childhood, and how old memories seemed to tell her how to feel years on. She was still picky; she was still food insecure. She would go on these crazy fasts, then overeat for two or three days. And none of it seemed to matter &ndash; whether it was her god-given metabolism or a byproduct of <a href="/posts/2021-05-28-forever/">GHD</a>, she had weighed exactly 86 pounds for over three years. Which at 58 inches was skinny, but wasn&rsquo;t half bad considering where she&rsquo;d come from. The porridge makes &rsquo;em short and retarded, as Moise says.</p>
<p>In a girls&rsquo; school full of poor girls, everything is for keeps. The dining hall was run as a charity and it was good, but no one was kidding themselves about the sweetbread. Tzipora was told it was the brains of a lamb &ndash; it wasn&rsquo;t brains, it was the pancreas, but what did it matter? There was always spare sweetbread on Tuesdays, but good luck finding second serves of the roast on Sundays. The nun never gave you enough the first time, so you had to swallow it as quick as you could and go back before they ran out.</p>
<p>Even now, in another country on another continent, the nun is still running out of roast. And with every meal, even with her friends, she&rsquo;s got these freaky sensitivities that strum like a double bass when the menu comes out. No, she won&rsquo;t share her chips.</p>
<p>Tzipora got really into food in Vekllei. About half of the people in Vekllei came from overseas, so it was a world&rsquo;s pantry. She tried stuff she&rsquo;d never had before, and lots of things she didn&rsquo;t like. She had this vivid memory of eating breakfast with Lin Zhi, and her dad was in his boxers and singlet like he always was, and he brought out some wet fishy rice thing that tasted like it had been scooped fresh out of the Yangtze. She hated it. She ate the whole thing, but she hated it.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/municipal.jpg"/> <p><strong>The base unit</strong> of Vekllei society are municipalities, called <em>municipolis</em> in their language. They occupy a uniquely intimate presence in Vekllei life as an unusual body of public affairs. Unlike other state bodies in Vekllei, which function similar to their overseas counterparts, local municipalities supersede their conventional definition as mere &rsquo;local governments&rsquo; and are considerably more essential to the wellbeing of Vekllei communities.</p>
<p>In Vekllei, the word <em>municipolis</em> refers to</p>
<ul>
<li>Local government (the ‚Äòmunicipality‚Äô), as made up of assemblies, trade unions, civic organisations, chapels, and school children</li>
<li>The general legal authority of the municipality, including its petty legislature and local police</li>
<li>Features of the community that are owned by the community, like sewers, libraries, trams and public workshops</li>
<li>The municipal attitude of civil service and well-meaning bureaucracy</li>
<li>The municipal principles of localism, egalitarianism and democracy<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></li>
<li>The style and design language of community features (municipalist design; civic newda; socialist tectonicism)</li>
<li>The architecture of the national and commonwealth state as it manifests locally, like local branch offices of government companies and ministerial offices</li>
<li>Any sort of construction involving municipal agents or the Army Construction House (ACS)<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></li>
<li>All land and housing that is responsible to an agent of the Vekllei Delicture system<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>The ‚Äòmunicipal‚Äô in Vekllei are spaces that are both local and public. It is not just a phrase that refers to the machinery of local government, but in fact a descriptor for all aspects of the spirit of localism as an extension of Vekllei‚Äôs indigenous social anarchism. Like a lot of political concepts in Vekllei, its origins are cultural and emotional rather than legal &ndash; the ‚Äòmunicipalities‚Äô of Vekllei are vessels of all goodwill afforded to community services, from schools to general practitioners. They are fundamentally ‚Äòsun-facing‚Äô<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and optimistic.</p>
<p>A &lsquo;municipality&rsquo; describes a Vekllei community at any scale, as well as all of its social features &ndash; governance, law-making, design, civil services, infrastructure, and so on. It implies smallness and neighbourliness, but also scales up to borough-sized administrative divisions (called ‚Äòborough municipalities‚Äô), and, to some extent, the city-state of Vekllei itself. The same principles found in the atomic communities of society grow, like trees, into every level of government and inform the Vekllei national identity. The health of the utopianism of the Floral Period is diagnosed in its communities, not its governments.</p>
<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>These principles, in addition to self-mangement and self-interest, are reproduced broadly as part of &lsquo;Sundress Municipalism,&rsquo; a national spirit of the Vekllei state.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>The ACS is a major construction firm.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>The Vekllei Delicture system refers to the brokerage of ownership between the Land Sovereign, the municipal agent and the occupier; in other words, the negotiation of land-ownership from the land itself.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:4">
<p><em>Semoisnesne</em>, or &lsquo;sun-facing,&rsquo; is a Vekllei phrase for positivity and general sense of wellbeing.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/panaderas.jpg"/> <p><strong>She was in Lo</strong>, at the end of its winding river, standing in the place where the interior rains met the warm currents of the ocean. A mechanical clicking annoyed her but she could not tell if it was coming from the telephone exchange box or the electric street light above her head. It had just rained and it was a cold rain, so the air was sharp, and hurt and excited her lungs.</p>
<p>She had a toothache but wouldn‚Äôt go to the dentist. For one, she did not like dentists at all. They were much like doctors. She did not trust them. It was easy to forget that Tzipora had many simple opinions that betrayed her class of person. Also, she had a medical checkup each year that lasted a couple days. It was not far away now, and she‚Äôd rather get it all out of the way at once. If it became unbearable, she thought, she could always medicate it herself.</p>
<p>It would soon be winter, and the days were shorter now. The sun went down at four, and soon it would be dark by the time she got out of school. She hated the dark and hated the cold.  She thought about going abroad to a place with better weather. Maybe she would go to Barcelona and learn what it meant to be continental ‚Äî people always told her she looked like a gypsy. To bake bread and drink well and marry a soldier. Maybe she could ride with the gypsies, and travel in a wooden caravan, singing and dancing in a long skirt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ya vienen las panaderas por las calles de San Juan,
enga√±ando a los chiquillos cuatro duros vale un pan</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Dime panaderita como va el trato,
la harina va subiendo y el pan barato</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so on. And she would write letters back to Cobian and the rest announcing her adventures.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis week has been difficult,‚Äù she might say, ‚Äúthe French have crossed the Pyrenees and have besieged Pamplona. I have decided to take up arms to rescue my beloved husband, and have found passage there with a column of volunteers. Please send prayers and money.‚Äù</p>
<p>The leaves were starting to turn, and you found them heaped in gutters where the water drained. Her tooth was hurting. There was an emptiness inside her.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/transmission.jpg"/> <p><strong>Tzipora finished most school days</strong> at two in the afternoon. Her routine looked something like this. Catch the tram home. Walk if the weather is &lsquo;interesting&rsquo; (dramatic). Unlock the apartment and exchange her shoes for sandals. Bring in the bedding airing in the backyard and say hello to the stripy stray cat. Put away her books and rinse her lunchbox. Set the meat out to defrost and boil and refrigerate the water. Blow her nose. Eat an apple with a glass of milk. Listen to the news on the radio.</p>
<p>Depending on what she was making for dinner, she would usually head back out sometime around three thirty and find somewhere to read in her neighbourhood. From all places in Seispri you could see its beautiful circular high-voltage transmission towers, which carried power from the 2nd Magma-Electric Cogeneration Plant to their homes, supplying them with heat and light. The neighbourhood had been bombed in the war and there were still ruins out here. You could find old paths that were abandoned, overrun with mosses and bushes. These were good places to read.</p>
<p>Tzipora spent most evenings alone until Baron got home. She loved Cobian, but they were quite different people and Tzipora spent a lot of time in her own head. That was probably the origin of a lot of her neuroses; she processed things slowly and inwardly; a cascading reaction of memories and identity splitting and colliding. You could hear the transmission towers hum with electricity. She felt that if her skull wasn&rsquo;t so thick you could hear her brain humming, full of thoughts.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/liminal.jpg"/> <p><strong>Out on the branch lines</strong> there are in-between stations. Sometimes they emerge out of history as relics of dead and dying towns overlooked by the timetable. Others are a quirk of the rail company machine &ndash; workshops and line junctions where people switch trains. As you get further and further out of the city, and the trains get older and older, these in-between stations become more common. Between Yana and Kotaismoyeh there is an irregular line serviced by steam trains that are over a hundred years old. <a href="/factbook/society/industry/rail/">Vekllei National Rail</a> thinks in centuries.</p>
<p>There is, perversely, a cultural incentive in Vekllei to prioritise experiences over efficiency or productivity. In Vekllei, the company is responsible for not just a material product but an emotional service to its employees and customers, which makes up part of the bizarre social theatre of the Vekllei economy. Vekllei National Rail has the means to rework its rural timetables, modernise its rolling stock and build faster lines. These features are a straightforward economic benefit and a convenience to the people who travel with them. But that is, as the Vekllei colloquialism goes, &ldquo;thinking like an American.&rdquo; Companies in Vekllei, year after year, become more inefficient, apathetic, and playful. Not simply because they are badly managed or poor, but because they have a human emotional interest in cultivating the &ldquo;new way of living&rdquo; &ndash; the Floral Period way of living.</p>
<p>In this system, steam trains continue to run not just because they are objects of history and sentimental to their ridership, but because they are old, easily physically conceptualised, and slow. So too are under-utilised routes serviced. It is not that Vekllei National Rail is unaware of their inefficiencies &ndash; Vekllei National Rail is in fact asserting its cultural priorities on you, and expects you to weather those inconveniences. If that sounds sinister, it shouldn&rsquo;t &ndash; every aspect of Vekllei society is like this, and contributes to the richness of their lives. In one sense, it is manipulative and managing, but the opposite is also true &ndash; to scrap old rolling stock, rebuild lines and close stations would also coerce people into new journeys and places. You only need to look at the alternative mindset in America, where wealth and accessible consumerism has, by the late 21st Century, stripped out most of what makes life worth living. Their lives are more convenient and empty than ever, which has contributed to a cultural slump that in part spurred the collapse of Ford and the Dallas Secession.</p>
<p>Tzipora sits at an in-between station and she understands this. This is what makes Vekllei National Rail so smart, she thinks. There is a direct, tragic parallel between the collapse of the Ford Motor Company and why she is waiting forty five minutes for the steam train to the village of Vos. Vekllei people don&rsquo;t realise it because they are immersed in their own intricate ways of thinking, and they will never understand living in the shrill, hedonistic fantasy of the middle class. Being so wealthy and so empty that you&rsquo;re sitting in a motel room trying to figure out if you want to&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatchoo thinking about, Zelda?&rdquo; Moise asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This sucks. How much longer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Vekllei schools, they take an hour and a half for lunch most days. Food is a complicated subject here, as a ubiquitous demonstration of the Vekllei cultural tradition and its relative scarcity compared to consumer societies.</p>
<p>Food unable to be grown for the house is usually obtained from grocers. Those grocers put in orders for produce from agricultural companies or their representatives ‚Äî usually ‚Äòpetty‚Äô (informal) bureaus. Some of these are farms, but more commonly in cities they are greenhouses and hydroponics factories. Rather than manage the stock of individual staples and products, most grocers elect to enrol in automated inventory management through the <strong>Central Product Inventories</strong> (CPI) system, which are computerised and manage delivery automatically.</p>
<p>The problem with this system is that it is both very open-ended (it contains most commercially available foodstuffs in Vekllei) and very unreliable. Central Product Inventories have frequent backlogs for specialty products, particularly foreign foods, and so only staples are available regularly. As these delays cascade down to the consumer, they reveal a system that has no real intention of giving everyone what they want, all of the time.</p>
<p>Because of this, many Vekllei people in cities dine out most nights. In the context of schools, this means that the provision of hot, nutritious lunches for students was considered necessary. It is the only real way to guarantee the food intelligence and cooking ability of the postwar generation, who may not otherwise cook at home.</p>
<p>In some schools, parents and teachers help student volunteers cook. In others, like Tzipora‚Äôs Moshel St School, classrooms take turns cooking for the rest of the school. Depicted here is Tzipora‚Äôs packed lunch alongside an example of a lunch provided by the school.</p>
<h4 id="tziporas-lunch">
  Tzipora‚Äôs Lunch
  <a class="anchor" href="#tziporas-lunch">#</a>
</h4>
<p>If not eating leftovers, Tzipora likes things that she can eat with her fingers. Processed meats and sausages are readily available in Vekllei and replace cold cuts of meat most days. The heaviness of the blood sausage and kabanos is alleviated with some fruit paste and cherry tomatoes.</p>
<p>Pickled foods keep for a long time and so are a great way to fill out a packed lunch. Tzipora eats her pickled onions first, otherwise her breath smells like onion for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Tzipora is also sweet on soft drinks, and rotates through different flavours to keep them interesting. The carbonation suits the crackers and sausage well.</p>
<p>She has fruit tingles, a chalky tablet sweet, for dessert. The cake isn&rsquo;t for her; it&rsquo;s to trade for other sweets. She&rsquo;s eaten enough of it at home already.</p>
<h4 id="school-lunch">
  School Lunch
  <a class="anchor" href="#school-lunch">#</a>
</h4>
<p>Stews, sometimes called casseroles in Vekllei, are a staple of local cuisine and are an easy and tasty way to feed hundreds of students. They‚Äôre made out of ingredients of abundance ‚Äî the sorts of root vegetables and lab meats churned out en masse by the inflexible hydroponics system of the country. Most schools also have gardens and produce all of of their own vegetables, in this case herbs, carrots, onions, potatoes, and tomatoes.</p>
<p>The stew is eaten with bread, which is often shared between friends. A portion of cheese is provided for dessert ‚Äî today, a semi-hard Norwegian-style cheese (called Keysmi in Vekllei) with cloves and cumin.</p>
<p>Most government schools serve small portions of wine with meals, even to primary school students. Milk is an available substitute.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Vekllei people have a right to organise in their work. This principle is expressed in the structure of the economy, in which cooperative enterprises form company ballots that go on to inform commercial and industrial practice. Collections of individual trade unions may form bureaus, massive monopolies of organised workplaces cooperating and competing under the bizarre structure of the Vekllei moneyless economy. These are expressions of a mobilised democratic workforce which sustain the country in their self-interest, and are a defining characteristic of the Floral Period.</p>
<p>Organisation also exists outside the workplace. Their negotiations occur with the municipal and state authorities, and are a common means by which groups of people express their grievances and strengthen each other. The most well-known of these are Vekllei‚Äôs Chapel system ‚Äî the unionisation of local women.</p>
<p>Chapels are localised by community. Tzipora was at first very sceptical of the Chapels, which had offered her membership upon her arrival in Vekllei. You have to understand, Tzipora was in a crisis of inferiority at this time, and considered the ingratitude of the ungovernable female organisers to be na√Øve and entitled. She was convinced otherwise by Ayn, who was a moderate and carefully-spoken person.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou want to integrate in Vekllei, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù She asked Tzipora. ‚ÄúThis is what integration looks like; the Chapels are an expression of our democracy. A means of support and celebration; to have people know and care for you. There is no political commitment.‚Äù</p>
<p>Tzipora found Chapel meetings to be friendly and informal, characterised by shared meals and conversations of joys and grievances. Local Chapel ‚Ññ 23 was a social club of individuals made strong by their trust in each other. Tzipora sat silently at the end of the Chapel hall, an old concrete building with a flat roof built after the war. It had the appearance of a midcentury church. She ate her bread and sausage with her fingers and listened to the women talk amongst themselves. Children ran around, playing chasings. It was not like any place she‚Äôd been before.</p>
<p><em>Well-wishes to all this International Women‚Äôs Day</em></p>

"And who is this lady?"
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Tora, a Palace God who comes to Pachinki,&rdquo; Tzipora said, stumbling over her words. &ldquo;The other Goddesses don&rsquo;t like her much, um, and she&rsquo;s quite powerful. She goes to Pachinki to unite mortals against the Palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Baron said, not following but nodding politely. &ldquo;She looks a lot like you, doesn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Tzipora said, brushing away the question with another piece of paper pulled from her schoolbag. &ldquo;This is her mortal bodyguard, Hyssop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of name is Hyssop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s made up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Why not use normal names?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I keep telling you, it&rsquo;s not a normal world, it&rsquo;s a completely different one,&rdquo; Tzipora whined in that way she did when you weren&rsquo;t keeping up. &ldquo;Hyssop means &lsquo;Guardian of the Poor&rsquo; in his language, so it&rsquo;s sort of a metaphor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve put a lot of thought into this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tzipora talked fast and anxiously. Pachinki was a private fantasy &ndash; a dreamscape of magic and planets and monsters. She was showing Baron her drawings because she shared everything with him. But now, in his hands, her drawings looked all wrong. The people looked weird and her story seemed childish. It was embarrassing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;The Palace only exists because they believe in themselves&hellip; The moment they lose faith, they lose their powers and collapse their space in the Marble Realm,&rdquo; she said, then stopped and rubbed her nose. &ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;m just going on and on. I get boring quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Baron said. &ldquo;Is Tora planning to rob them of their faith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mean what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not being tedious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not. I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked relieved and rubbed her nose again. &ldquo;Yes, she does, but it&rsquo;s not that simple. You see&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat there in the afternoon sun for over an hour, talking, shuffling papers.</p>

<p><strong>In Vekllei, you met all sorts of people</strong>. All nations passed through the Home Islands, some to visit, others to live. Tzipora met a great many of them in her time at school.</p>
<p>Sydney came from Kosava, an anarchist island commune in the Lesser Antilles we know as St Kitts and Nevis. Kosava is an independent member-state of the Kalina Islands, which describes a series of autonomous islands in the Caribbean. Together, they form the Kalina Sovereign, an independent full member of Vekllei&rsquo;s &ldquo;Atlantic Commonwealth,&rdquo; which is something between a federation and a superstate. It was anarchism in the confusing Vekllei sense of the word &ndash; self-organising, democratic, and totally dependent on bureau overproduction to furnish the gaps.</p>
<p>Commonwealth members, including Vekllei, are united in a belief in Floral Economics and share a lot of social features between them, including education, security, healthcare and bureau labour. A Kalinago girl is not that different from her sister in Vekllei, so it turns out. Together they represent a vanguard of island states in the Atlantic, a self-determining Commonwealth of different people resisting the hegemonies of Europe and the Americas with new ways of living.</p>
<p>Hitori was like Tzipora; she was not from Vekllei. Her parents were Japanese and she&rsquo;d come here as a baby. It seemed like every second person was an immigrant, which indicated a shift in what &ldquo;Vekllei&rdquo; meant in the 21st Century. Under the various regimes of the Junta, it had been a colonial turn-of-phrase to describe the Algic-European metropole in the Home Islands. These days, it was more open-ended and democratic.</p>
<p>Vekllei has been multicultural since its origins as a meeting place of Scandinavian and Algic peoples. Today is no different, except its promise reaches farther and many more are arriving than before. Things are going well in Vekllei, and the quality of life can be exquisite &ndash; provided you have certain expectations of what an &ldquo;exquisite life&rdquo; looks like. That was what kept people coming; an emerging Vekllei and the happiness of their children.</p>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>Hobart here, creator of this whole thing. For a couple years now I&rsquo;ve maintained a small <a href="https://www.patreon.com/vekllei">Patreon</a> for those interested in supporting my work. Like most Patreons, this has operated monthly.</p>
<p>From now on, <strong>patrons will only be charged on the release of a comic chapter</strong>. This could be once a month, but will more likely be a bit longer. This means a little less money for me, but also less anxiety about producing enough public work to earn the money pledged to me. It seems more fair, and the comic will be worth it.</p>
<p>So what will change? For patrons, <strong>nothing will change except that you will be charged less frequently</strong>. You will continue to recieve precisely the same benefits I&rsquo;ve promised, including future merch and roles on the Vekllei Discord.</p>
<p><strong>I will continue to produce standalone posts,</strong> much as I always have &ndash; but instead of battling a creeping anxiety of losing patrons if I don&rsquo;t meet a post quota, I&rsquo;ll be working more creatively and flexibly according to the needs of the comic. My work will be better for it, I reckon.</p>
<p><strong>In summary:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Supporters will now be charged on the release of each chapter of the comic, instead of monthly.</li>
<li>Merch and Discord rewards will be the same.</li>
<li>You won&rsquo;t pay as frequently and will get more for your money as chapters come out.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;d like to support me in other ways, maybe buy a postcard when the MillMint Shop launches!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions, just leave a comment below and I&rsquo;ll help you out.</p>
<p>Thanks always,</p>

</ul>
<p>2021 was a pretty bad year. I won‚Äôt go on about it much because it‚Äôs not very interesting and it‚Äôs not the point of my writing this. Let&rsquo;s only hope suffering makes good art!</p>
<p>This last year, I haven&rsquo;t finished what I&rsquo;ve wanted to finish, and it&rsquo;s caused some anxiety for me for months now. This is my New Year&rsquo;s resolution to you all, including my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/vekllei">beloved patrons</a>, who I thank sincerely for sticking with me through a really inconsistent creative period.</p>
<p>New Year&rsquo;s resolutions are kind of corny, and they don&rsquo;t work out for everyone. So don&rsquo;t think of this as a resolution as such &ndash; 2022 is a nice even number, and it&rsquo;s a good time, arbitrary as any other, for a change in the winds.</p>
<p>My goal is to have something to show every other day or so. I&rsquo;ve got a long list of ideas I&rsquo;m going to work through. Hopefully this will provoke a change in behaviour from me.</p>
<p>Why not join me? Pick up a pencil and I&rsquo;ll draw with you. You can come say hi at the <a href="https://discord.gg/dCE6vSU">Vekllei Discord server</a> and catch me drawing sometime.</p>
<p>Thanks again. I&rsquo;m only at the start of the journey here. But this community is where it begins.</p>
<p>Warm regards,</p>

<p><strong>Occasionally I&rsquo;ll join an &ldquo;art trade&rdquo;</strong> to change things up and break the repetition of working in one universe with one set of characters. Bez is a friend of mine and a talented artist, and so for Christmas we decided to produce secret works involving characters and places we don&rsquo;t usually draw. There&rsquo;s nothing more exciting as an artist than seeing through new eyes &ndash; that&rsquo;s the magic of having someone illustrate your people and places.</p>
<p>My piece, finished today three days after Christmas, depicts the Vekllei crew encountering Valin and her aphis, a sort of canine-feline hybrid creature. The setting is based on photographs I took of where I grew up, amidst temperate rainforest on my property. Bez&rsquo;s contribution is below. I love it.</p>

</p>
<p>I like the attention to detail on Tzipora and the golden wattle on the right. Vekllei has wattle as canon &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t make much sense, but who cares? It&rsquo;s too lovely to exclude from utopia. Bez also shared a preliminary sketch with me, seen below.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/friends.jpg"/> <p><strong>Cobian was a complicated person</strong>. When Tzipora met her, she was burdened by her parents and wracked by small faults that glinted openly at the other girls in the school halls. She was insecure, out of touch, a little childish, and desperate to be liked. Tzipora was a fair bit like her, but carried those traits in different ways. It was funny how people, similar in disposition, came across so differently.</p>
<p>Cobian used to say what she thought people wanted to hear. Kids can sniff weakness a mile off. Desperation reeks. Her lame jokes and self-conscious friend-making were tolerated politely, but she didn‚Äôt have a regular group to spend recess with until Tzipora came along. Tzipora pitied her and liked her eagerness to establish a boring sort of friendship ‚Äî they were both lonely and really just wanted to do the things normal girls do. Sleepovers and phone calls and that shit.</p>
<p>Tzipora has coarse, bouncy hair made up of many hundreds of spirals and tufts, which she straightens. If you tousle it, grains of sand might fall out, like she‚Äôs just ploughed her head into the ground somewhere. Cobian has shiny, conditioned hair with a severe fringe and, at school, a bun that meets regulations that don‚Äôt exist. That was what they were like, as friends. You could tell by looking at them.</p>
<p>Cobian is not like how she used to be. She knows herself now and isn‚Äôt so distraught by sad memories of primary school. It was funny how people so different improve each other.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/rumba.jpg"/> <p><strong>Coretti Adoula was a good singer but didn‚Äôt sing much</strong>. Tzipora had regarded her politely but distantly for a while after Moise started dating her in 10th grade. It was an awkward thing. Tzipora was not quite sure how to strike up a conversation ‚Äî maybe she was a little insecure.</p>
<p>Coretti was an Afro-Russian, but had lived in Vekllei since she was six. She spoke without an accent and was well-accustomed to life in Vekllei. Tzipora had been born in Vekllei, but here she stood, short and stupid with the clumsy, childish accent of a foreigner. She was very self-conscious about her foreignness.</p>
<p>There was also a contest of appearances. Moise was Tzipora‚Äôs first male friend, and so she paid attention to who he liked. Coretti was tall, sweet-natured, pretty and had dark skin of the kind Tzipora hadn‚Äôt seen before. Every time she saw Coretti, Tzipora was suddenly aware of how short, bad-mannered and pale she was. In some ways, they were opposed in his orbit, competing for Moise‚Äôs time and affection as satellites.</p>
<p>About the time Moise and Coretti started dating, Tzipora was spending a lot of time in clubs, immersing herself in the Lola jazz scene. It was a fantastic time to be in it ‚Äî Lola is a neighbourhood of migrants, and you had all the sounds of the world ringing out across the borough. Tzipora loved jazz ‚Äî she liked any kind of interesting, syncopated and percussive music ‚Äî and Coretti‚Äôs brother was the drummer in a Congolese rumba band called <em>Rats de Brazzaville</em>. His name was Andre. Tzipora knew him well. <em>Rats de Brazzaville</em> were a big band with a big sound, which made them a big deal for dance clubs. She had probably seen them play a dozen times.</p>
<p>Talk about a small world. When Coretti brought it up, the usually quiet Tzipora looked up ‚Äî <em>Andre Adoula? From the Brazzaville Rats? How do you know him?</em> All it took was that coincidence and a love of rumba, and all of Tzipora‚Äôs misgivings about Coretti were forgotten. Why should she sit here and pity herself? It feels better to dance, doesn‚Äôt it?</p>

  The Vekllei Person
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-vekllei-person">#</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>What good is more writing about theories and the methodology of country-constructs?</strong> More importantly ‚Äî how is it authentically convincing to the person who has lived their entire lives immersed in their own ways of living? Vekllei does not use money ‚Äî the purpose of these notes are to demonstrate how such a thing works, immersing Vekllei‚Äôs participatory economy in a human lens, and articulate the motivations, biases and assumptions of the average working Vekllei person. This is what a Vekllei working life looks like from the ground up.</p>
<p>It is important to recognise Vekllei people do not think like you.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> They are not particularly more altruistic, hard-working, or kind to each other. They are, however, affected by their environment, which has introduced foundational shifts in their basic assumptions about the world. These differences can be illustrated in three features of life, which illustrate the worldview of the typical Vekllei person.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="metaphysical-assumptions">
  Metaphysical assumptions
  <a class="anchor" href="#metaphysical-assumptions">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Vekllei person understands that there is an afterlife, and that spirits, demons, and a collection of mythological creatures play a part in human life. She does not hold contemporary conceptualisations of landscape &ndash; she does not think of nature except in abstract, transcendental ways. She fears and respects nature, which is <a href="/posts/2020-12-05-gods/">afforded sovereignty by Crown Lands</a> under the Landscape Sovereign. She does not believe humans are caretakers of nature. She does not believe in a god, but if she does it created and maintains both the human and natural worlds. She believes the purpose of people is the comfort of people and the good stewardship of human lands.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="existential-assumptions">
  Existential assumptions
  <a class="anchor" href="#existential-assumptions">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Vekllei person is prepped from a young age to explore their adult personhood. Schooling fosters his interests and technical skills, and prepares him for the casual pace of Vekllei working life. He is motivated to accomplish a social or professional legacy before he dies. He is not particularly anxious about his future. He considers the quality of life in Vekllei to be the best in the world, without having lived anywhere else.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="material-assumptions">
  Material assumptions
  <a class="anchor" href="#material-assumptions">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Vekllei person understands objects in <a href="/posts/2020-10-11-metaphysic/">physical and social dimensions of utility</a>. Life is full of small art and beauty for her, accessed frequently and easily through cafes, cinemas, picnics, galleries and travel. The spatiality and physicality of her surrounds are of keen interest to her and open interest in the mechanisms of society. She is comfortable and skeptical about new things.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the introduction of robotics into Vekllei&rsquo;s industrial and civilian infrastructure, about 90% of people are employed in some capacity. With an illustration of the average Vekllei person fresh in our minds, let us explore why people continue to work in an age without money.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-vekllei-people-work">
  Why do Vekllei people work?
  <a class="anchor" href="#why-do-vekllei-people-work">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Because they have to, and because there is only so much else to do. In a broad sense, activity is a feature of all people, and work in Vekllei fulfils the desire for activity because it is easy where wanted and rewarding where needed. If work is not easy or rewarding it is mostly dispensed with; Vekllei people are not particularly self-sacrificing.</p>
<p>When work is conceived of in a wage, time and effort are calculated against each other, and removing the wage collapses most reasons for working. In Vekllei no such arrangement exists &ndash; wage labour has not really existed in postwar occupation and free society. We are several generations removed from the age of compensation and into an epoch of rest, which has recalculated waking hours along idling interest and curiosity. Work exists because it is essential to the functioning of society, and because it provides a meaningful method of exploring interests and skill-building. At no point are Vekllei people expected to desire work &ndash; it is something they have to do, and its burden is minimised at great expense.</p>
<p>These are sentiments that make sense immersed in their context &ndash; made real by the animistic, satisfied, and curious type of Vekllei person. They are also sentiments made possible only by Vekllei&rsquo;s architected strengths and concessions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal luxuries (jewellery, appliances, domestic aid, mechanical dishwashers, specialised food appliances) are rare, but luxuries of free time and entertainment (underfloor heating, caf√©s, music venues and bars, alcohol, pleasant public gardens and commons) are abundant and easily accessible.</li>
<li>Most commodities require personal effort to obtain, but are usually worth the effort (houseplants are found and potted personally, good meat is hunted and prepared, and artisanal furniture is often traded).</li>
<li>Vekllei has a thriving barter economy built on favours, goodwill, and lending a hand. These social dimensions of the economy are facts of life for every person &ndash; everyone is aware of the state of things.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a society where housing, transport, food, small art and beauty are cheap, and convenience is expensive. It does not work equally for everyone &ndash; it was never designed to. The simplicty of moneylessness is actually very complicated, and the Vekllei economy is made up of countless markets bristling with politics, friendships, family, grudges and good-neighbourliness. Outside of bureau monopolies, which meet the basic needs of society, the Vekllei economy is anarchic.</p>
<p><a href="/posts/2020-07-13-economy/">In a previous article</a>, these ideas were characterised as the three precepts of the Vekllei economy, articulated as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Austerity</strong>. Petty austerity lurks at the fringes of Vekllei life. Commmon items are frequently in short supply, and require a &ldquo;trial of ownership&rdquo; to acquire. This prevents Vekllei&rsquo;s reliable transition to a consumer society, which would strain bureau production and require more factory work. It also serves a cultural purpose in localising consumption and incentivising work, as a reward mechanism.</li>
<li><strong>Apathy</strong>. Small businesses in <em>senrouiva</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> markets are not provided with reliable methods to expand their business or indeed employ more people than one is capable of knowing. This protects the bureau trade monopolies and bureau-size companies, which are critical aspects of Vekllei&rsquo;s consumer manufacturing.</li>
<li><strong>Play</strong>. Like children, Vekllei people participate in work as a social ritual and act out roles in society. This play is productive and contributes to the economy, a fact that does not delegitimise its status as a social activity.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>People work because they are built to work</strong>. This is not an altruistic idea. It is important to seperate contemporary Western conceptions of wage labour from the reality of Vekllei work, which is largely social and purposeful. Not all work is pleasant, a fact that requires a series of cascading solutions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It is improved</strong>. Retail, hospitality and service work in Vekllei are jobs justified only by their dignity. There are only a handful of sales assistants in Vekllei, and their roles are independent and well-respected &ndash; they serve satisfaction, not the company. These usually include working with customers personally to prepare complete outfits, improving their confidence, and studying and practicing fashions. In addition, many people in such work are employed by friends or family, or otherwise work only part time.</li>
<li><strong>It is rewarded</strong>. Work is rewarded materially in Vekllei, despite misconceptions. In some work, the benefits are small and inconsequential &ndash; good leftovers and access to scarce goods among them. Most commonly, real estate is constructed by the municipal agent and protected for certain types of work, the ownership of which can be wrested away from the employer with extended service. Health care workers are provided for in Vekllei in overt ways &ndash; Vekllei is not, by principle, egalitarian.</li>
<li><strong>It is shared</strong>. Although large companies retain cleaning automen, most smaller enterprises and senrouive share the burden of cleaning among staff periodically, as at home and school. Schools, similarly, rely mostly on parent volunteers to provide lunches and run extracurricular activities. Since it is common in Vekllei for only one parent to work, much community organising and child-rearing is provided by stay-at-home mums and dads.</li>
<li><strong>It is automated</strong>. Most factory labour in bureaus is automated by automanufacturies, which require only minimal supervision and are usually integrated into the place of work. Automanufacturies produce the vast majority of shelf goods in the country, including consumer, industrial and agricultural products. The production of automen<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> is, mostly, automated in the same process.</li>
<li><strong>It is conscripted</strong>. Essential labour, particularly in construction, is conscripted through Compulsory Service. The Army Construction House is the largest construction outfit in Vekllei, and is responsible for much of rural construction in the country.</li>
<li><strong>It is done without</strong>. Vekllei life is missing or unreliably demonstrates features of consumer societies overseas, including many personal electronics, autos, and appliances. Most people have only a handful of personal items and a few pairs of shoes, although their housing and accessible entertainment is of much higher quality.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be difficult to conceptualise working for free without first immersing yourself in a society where comfort is universal, there is little else to do, and there is no upward mobility through idleness. Powerful cultural biases, particularly as they pertain to consumption and community, are potent social pressures. Power itself is abundant in Vekllei and awarded freely to people seeking it. Jobs carry respect, since employment with dignity almost always requires agency, and agency requires independence and problem solving. And where a job is unsatisfying, unenviable, unrewarding, and unfulfilled, it is dispensed with. Not because the Vekllei state is particularly noble &ndash; instead, it cannot do anything but accept it.</p>
<h2 id="meaningful-work-for-ordinary-people">
  Meaningful work for ordinary people
  <a class="anchor" href="#meaningful-work-for-ordinary-people">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Although a great many specialisations exist in Vekllei for its millions of people, jobs are treated of constellations of tasks. For three days a week, the skilled tradesmen works in their specialty, but like it is in school, the fourth day is often dedicated to tasks of company maintenance. Such tasks may include cleaning, food preparation, gardening, maintenance and clerical work. No one likes it, but it has to be done. Labour can&rsquo;t be purchased and there are few people willing to clean or repair uncompensated &ndash; so it remains the company&rsquo;s problem. Since most companies in Vekllei are cooperative, and are owned by the people who work in them, it more precisely remains their problem.</p>
<p>Most people in Vekllei work three or four days a week, depending on their job and place of employ. Some may work more or less. People particularly desperate to avoid regular employment will find it is easy to do so, with the exception of Compulsory Service, which requires four years from every person sometime between the ages of 18 and 35. You are supposed to register employment with the Employment Commission<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, but there are many hundreds of exceptions to employment readily available to the social parasite. That is the precise Vekllei phrase, in fact &ndash; &ldquo;social parasitism&rdquo; &ndash; which surfaces in government reports and local gossip alike.</p>
<p>The straightforward requirement to be employed, called &ldquo;Contribution,&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> suggests tremendous waste and inefficiency &ndash; this is accurate, and <a href="/posts/2020-07-13-economy/">is considered a feature of the system</a>. Work is both productive and a social benefit to society, and its actual efficiency is of little concern except in the context of bureau companies,<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> which support the basic comforts of society. The senrouive economy, in all its anarchy, best resembles a modern post-industrial service economy. The product is in fact the managing, serving, networking and strategic thinking of the senrouive class of people. The scale and gross productivity of senrouive work in Vekllei is nearly three times that of the bureau-backed industrial/agricultural monopolies that come to mind when imagining typical &ldquo;bureau business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With much of manufacturing automated by automanufacturies, it is easy to overlook less dramatic efficiencies in the industrial workplace, which now requires only half the staff it did a hundred years ago. In general, automation has affected Vekllei slowly and to its benefit, allowing the country to trade potential increases in productivity for less work. Less work was an essential reaction to the famines and indigence of the early postwar years, and has become a cherished feature of postwar Vekllei society.</p>
<p>This loose collection of notes indicates some of the differences in the working disposition of Vekllei people and what their work looks like. Like most summaries of the so-called &ldquo;Vekllei bureau system&rdquo;, this brief collection of facts tends to paint an excessively sentimental picture of working life in Vekllei &ndash; but there are few ways otherwise to describe the utopian premise of the Atlantic commonwealth, and its ongoing reevaluation of the imagined end of history.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/hanukkah.jpg"/> <p>Tzipora lived among Jews in the industrial neighbourhood of Seispri in <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/lola/">Lola</a>. They had come over after the troubles in Tel Aviv and their persecution in the Dallas States. She had seen that; that was where she learned of her own history. It was not through faith or practice or family that she had discovered her Jewishness, but persecution ‚Äî the unfolding story of all Ashkenazim.</p>
<p>A lot of them had come to Vekllei looking for the opportunity to establish some sort of satellite community for the diaspora too embittered or radical to return to Israel. In the early days Vekllei resembled collapsing British mandates of years past, ripe for nation-building and dramatic new ways of living.</p>
<p>That heritage was a lot to bear, especially for a girl who didn‚Äôt consider herself Jewish. She was still a Catholic, lapsed only in her affection for God. She didn‚Äôt know anything about Jews; she barely knew anything about Vekllei. All her life had been one way of living, one way of knowing herself, and now she lived with a Jewish man in a foreign neighbourhood that didn‚Äôt use money.</p>
<p>Only Greeks, Irish and Italians celebrate Christmas in Vekllei. The people of Seispri celebrate Hanukkah near the same time. Tzipora, in her crisis of identity and faith, championed both ‚Äî because why shouldn‚Äôt she? With the Catholic sabbath on Sunday and Shabbas on Saturday she got both ends of the deal. God knew she needed the rest.</p>
<p>Happy Hanukkah, everyone.</p>

In the dawning weeks after Vekllei‚Äôs catastrophic war, the British occupiers (<strong>British Recovery Expedition to Vekllei</strong>, or <strong>BREVEK</strong>) released into the streets some 16,000 activists who were rotting away in political prisons. The majority of these were communists or sympathisers, and found themselves vindicated in the ashes of prewar society. ‚ÄúLook at what we told you,‚Äù they wrote in the first issue of the Worker, ‚Äúour country is in ashes.‚Äù It is no coincidence that the Vekllei Communist Party was founded on March 3rd, two days after the occupation of the country. They treated the British as liberators.</p>
<p>The release of political prisoners coincided with the legalisation of labour unions, which exploded in membership ‚Äî some 4 million Vekllei, or 60% of the country, were union members by 2011. Most were not aware of what a union did or what purpose they served, but membership could prevent starvation and they were independent from the BREVEK occupying apparatuses.</p>
<p>This rise in unionism surprised and alarmed BREVEK commanders, who could see trouble brewing ‚Äî the unions were a keg, and the communists were an open flame. Since union leadership was usually sympathetic towards the Marxists, and were effective at mobilising their members, it was not difficult to imagine the communists seizing their advantage once occupation ended and 200,000 British troops left Vekllei.</p>
<p>What resulted was the <strong>Vekllei Interim Prosperity Government</strong>, an early preparation for Vekllei independence orchestrated to temper communist support. The Interim Prosperity Government deliberately excluded existing political activists in its advisory board, but did not exclude radicals altogether ‚Äî instead, communism was defanged through the invitation of ‚Äúloveable radicals‚Äù in the arts, scientific, industrial and legal communities. These people were often sympathisers, but they were not equipped or networked to mobilise the labour unions, and so were seen as a favourable strategic concession by BREVEK. Another interesting fact is that over half of the Interim Government were women ‚Äî simply because they were not well represented among Vekllei Communist Party leadership.</p>
<p>This is how, in an absurd way, Vekllei‚Äôs first independent government was made up mostly of communists but was not a communist government. And it was precisely this disruption of the Marxist revolutionary process that resulted in Vekllei‚Äôs unusual syndicalism, which on weekdays moves fluidly between state centralism and anarchy. It was precisely the sort of government vulnerable to displacement, if not for the threat of violence from 200,000 British occupiers. In fact, the Vekllei Communist Party was nearly driven underground by direct intervention by BREVEK command in 2014, after a general strike. The final blow to the Party came in 2015, with the outlawing of political parties in parliament and a transition to floral-style nonpartisan democracy.</p>
<p>Lin Zhi was a Chinese communist, and as of her sixteenth birthday, was now Vekllei, too. Her family, mostly princeling descendants of long-marchers, had been caught up in the purges and were now considered counterrevolutionary. There are many such communists in Vekllei. Moise‚Äôs girlfriend, Coretti, came from the socialist Congo and the USSR. Even Baron‚Äôs parents had been Labour Zionists. Vekllei was a very exciting place to be, full of memories and bitterness and optimism for an even-handed future, one in which unfavourable worker-peasant-soldiers, postcolonial refugees and dispirited Jews alike might dream of a truly multiracial socialist state.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/years.jpg"/> <p>Kaohsiung changed hands maybe four or five times. Each time the city fell, another company of Chinese burrowed themselves into the city, and each time it took about two months to drive them back into the sea. This was mostly done by the KMT and the Americans, who had heavy equipment. In Taiwan‚Äôs mountainous interior, a rainbow coalition of former colonies, indentured states and free-world ideologues fought brutally against the invasion of 2045.</p>
<p>It was a real nasty kind of fighting in a real nasty kind of war. Insects and dengue fever. Most of the fighting outside of Taipei happened close-quarters, or even hand-to-hand. His time there affected the rest of his life, and changed the way he looked at the world; looked at people. It forced a reconsideration of the sort of creatures we are, and the sort of management we need to keep ourselves from doing what we‚Äôre capable of doing.</p>
<p>What he liked about Tzipora was that she understood what it was like to come out the other side of a thing like that. She did not want to be rehabilitated; she did not want to be treated or talked to or sympathised with. She wanted to move on and pick up where she‚Äôd left off ‚Äî form some kind of life for herself in Vekllei, among decent people. The real killer of civilian life is the dysphoria of the supermarket, and the synthetic quality of domestic society in the shadow of the extraordinary hyperreality of violence.</p>
<p>He‚Äôd wasted the best years of his life in a jungle in Asia ‚Äî that experience was now part of who he was. Tzipora understood what that meant without asking. She was not so different, after all.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/cosme.jpg"/> <p>Moise‚Äôs father worked for Cosme Car, and a big company like that throws a big party each year to celebrate the passing of the summer solstice. It was a good excuse to dress up and drink. This time of year, the sun never sets on the north of Vekllei. It gently touches the horizon and begins to rise again. Tzipora caught a train up the coast with Moise and his dad and they arrived before seven.</p>
<p>The big Cosme party was thrown at its headquarters and manufacturing plant in Bohs each year. At the centre of the facility was Auto Tower, which rose 50 floors above the ground and housed workers at the plant. General wisdom was the higher you climbed, the better the party.</p>
<p>Moise had dressed up as Zeus, but Tzipora didn‚Äôt know much about the Greek myths and thought he was Caesar. Moise, for his part, thought Tzipora had decided to accompany him as Helios, god of the sun. She didn‚Äôt know who or what a Helios was, but didn‚Äôt want to disappoint him so she pretended. She had actually been aiming for the indigenous warrior spirit Acovo.</p>
<p>Willy the spy was there, on the lawns away from the music. He wasn‚Äôt a good guy ‚Äî he was an officer with AB/NI, and exemplified the fraying edge of Vekllei‚Äôs wide-cast intelligence net. He was creepy. Tzipora, in her upside-down view of things, liked him well enough and struck up a conversation with him. Willy liked that about her; he liked the comedy of this schoolgirl chatting with this monster about their old war stories. Moise had never met him before, and the guy put him on edge.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôve gotten so tall,‚Äù Willy said. Same joke every time he saw her ‚Äî Tzipora wasn‚Äôt getting any taller anytime soon. She shook her head.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat are you doing here? Who invites a guy like you? Did you get reassigned as a bodyguard?‚Äù Tzipora asked. He snorted.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm actually headed north for a couple days. Thought I‚Äôd stop in and have a beer. Feels like a long time since I seen you ‚Äî hey, why don‚Äôt you tell your old man to give me a call? I‚Äôm rotating out in a few weeks and wouldn‚Äôt mind the work. He‚Äôs hard to reach now, Director Desmoisnes.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt like you much, you know that.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúYeah, I know that.‚Äù</p>
<p>It was a good party. They lay about on the lawn drinking and talking like pantheon gods. The sun was low in the sky, and Auto Tower was glittering thirty minutes to midnight.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/gardencity.jpg"/> <p><strong>Vekllei is growing</strong>; it was an age of wonder. But it was still old enough to smell like wood smoke on cold days, when a thick mist travelled down from the highlands, filling and overflowing the valleys between glaciers, gentle and cool, leaving dew upon you. This is Vekllei; city of water and light.</p>
<p>Wet weather was Tzipora‚Äôs favourite because it made Vekllei feel like home. She recognised the smells better than she did the city. On rainy days <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/lola/">Lola</a> is filled with an urban fragrance of wood smoke and malt, which arose as vulcanised rubber and chemical soup washed down rain-slicked pavement.</p>
<p>A friendly petrichor rose out of the bitumen and soil around her. The smell changed with the temperature ‚Äî warm rain brought out the ghosts of vehicle exhaust, which smelled like synthetic petrol and a quiet alkali vapour that took some of the chemical sting out of it. Cold weather erased most of the dusty tang of the roads, and brought out water and weeds. Depending on where you were, your unconscious could be led through wet, knee-high grasses or distinct pleasures like fresh bread on a sill or wintry wood fires. Almost always, the distant smell of sulphur reminded you of Vekllei‚Äôs volcanism. In America, she had associated the smell with sewerage ‚Äî here, it was friendly and warming and ancient.</p>
<p>Above all, you could smell flowers. Vekllei is a city of flowers; it is a city of gardens. It is a commonly repeated fact that Vekllei has the most flowers per person in the world, and that fact is represented authentically in its decadently florid urban boroughs. Forget-me-nots, jasmine, lupines and mountain avens are a staple of every street. They are regarded not as a decoration but as a natural feature of all human landscapes ‚Äî is it any wonder their people are so happy and well-centred?</p>
<p>There is a Newda concept called <a href="/posts/2020-12-05-gods/">Dumousiantopet</a> (lit. Parted Sublime) which means ‚Äúbeautiful and seperate,‚Äù meaning human architecture and nature should be separated. This is often mistaken abroad as a rejection of natural design or urban gardens ‚Äî nothing could be further from the truth. Vekllei is full of nature ‚Äî in some places, it thrives in its own natural kingdoms, called crown lands. In others, it cohabits pavement, streets, and parks alongside humans. What ‚Äòdumousiantopet‚Äô means is that architecture should not inform nature, and that the greatest gift of architecture towards nature is decay, not imitation. Upen is fascinated with decay and its processes, and Newda inherits this fascination with impermanence. Only in Vekllei do you see such radical modernist architecture encroached by mosses.</p>
<p>After a rain, Tzipora walked home. Usually she‚Äôd take the tram up the hill to Seispri, where she lived, but it was better to walk on days like this. The city was subdued, and familiar places revealed new dimensions to the senses. The soft, flat light of mist brought out images in old concrete. Surfaces shone bright with water. A glimpse at the other side of the coin.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/gymslip.jpg"/> <p><strong>When she was a girl</strong>, her mum took her shopping once a year. She said it was important to keep your dignity, though they didn‚Äôt have much money. That was Mette.</p>
<p>When Tzipora relayed the memory to Baron, he said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs strange you call your mum by her first name.‚Äù</p>
<p>Plastic packaging was on the floor. In the mirror, a carousel of images. A new Zelda stares back, colourless and hollowed under the burden of the future. On a rail car headed east, the future is simple ‚Äî don‚Äôt fall beneath the wheels, avoid the bulls at sidings, and beg bread off the experienced bums. Out here, in the department store, it was complicated. Disgust glints in a half-turn; nausea.</p>
<p>This was, in total, her third uniform. The first was Colegio Charry in Bogot√° ‚Äî that was plaid, and had a frock like a fairytale. The second was St Mary‚Äôs, in Sacramento ‚Äî grey and blue; miserable like the girls. This was Vekllei‚Äôs. She liked it; she liked being in uniform again. She thought she looked sharp.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI never even said goodbye. I hated her so much for sending me away I wouldn‚Äôt hug her in the airport‚Ä¶ in the terminal, where you say goodbye. She said, ‚ÄòI love you, Tzipora,‚Äô and I didn‚Äôt say a thing back.‚Äù</p>
<p>Baron watched, listening like he did.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI hope when she died, wherever that was, she didn‚Äôt think of that moment in the ‚Äî oh, Christ, I can‚Äôt even say it. I can‚Äôt say it. That‚Äôs what I left her with.‚Äù</p>
<p>Her new self stared back, small and colourless. She looked at her eyes. Dull blue eyes. Behind them, memories clattered around. She suppressed them as they emerged in panic. One after the other, cut down ruthlessly and left to float, malformed and incomplete, further along stream of consciousness.</p>
<p><em>Mum died alone because ‚Äî it makes me want to jump off a roof ‚Äî so dramatic, it‚Äôs pathetic ‚Äî but it does, the feeling is real ‚Äî dramatic like all insecure people ‚Äî how about we think about the task at hand ‚Äî this gymslip is my size but doesn‚Äôt fit ‚Äî I‚Äôm still losing weight ‚Äî she died alone ‚Äî</em></p>
<p>Why was it that ghosts emerged in moments like this? They flocked to liminal spaces, guiding the paths between the past and the future.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt fits better than the skirt,‚Äù Baron said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shame they don‚Äôt have the in-betweens for the shirt, but I think it looks good. But I shouldn‚Äôt be the judge of such things. Ayn‚Äôll be back in a minute.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs not your thing, Baron. Thanks for doing it, though. It means a lot.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre just lucky the colours suit you. They never did me. Your skin goes well with the flowers; pale skin goes well with red.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòD‚Äôyou think so? Should I try the red skirt again?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt looks good like this.‚Äù</p>
<p>The memories had quieted; a warmness had flushed her nerves, cleaned them out and soothed the aches. She got that feeling with Baron. He had no reason to care about her and he did, and that meant a lot. She couldn‚Äôt admit it to him or herself, but in her heart he was already her dad. She hoped Mette was looking over her; she hoped her mum thought he was nice too. She would pray again tonight, at her bedside, and tell her she was sorry again. Tell her all about Baron and her life in Vekllei now.</p>
<p><em>Red suits me</em> ‚Äî Tzipora thought to herself ‚Äî <em>I think I look good like this.</em></p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/recess.jpg"/> <p>Tzipora had smoked since she was thirteen, and so she did for the rest of her life. What started out as a nasty habit in California‚Äôs decaying boarding school system eventually became a social medicine in the severe anxiety of her school years in Vekllei. She used her packs strategically, afraid of building a dependence that would dilute nicotine‚Äôs effects on her frayed nerves.</p>
<p>You were not allowed to smoke in government schools. Tzipora retained a pithy contempt of such methods of social control and smoked anyway, on the roof. She‚Äôd read science fiction there or listen to foreign radio. Sometimes she would read dangerous books ‚Äî things she liked to pretend could get her in trouble. Tzipora‚Äôs brief phase as a self-described Bolshevik began during recess on the roof of the Lola 6th School‚Äôs science block.</p>
<p>She was actually indulging in a sort of play-fantasy of the past; a revision of herself. There was nothing illegal about what she was doing, but she liked to pretend there was.</p>
<p>In a place of deep shame were fragments of a memory. Echoes that shot white hot in her mind ‚Äî a telephone booth; a lady answers; the face of a girl who told everyone she was pregnant; a handsome teacher; two students dragged out of class; rumours about communists; the end of year dance; four arrests and a suicide.</p>
<p>It was a memory she could not disclose even to herself, and so she recast her role in it subconsciously. She should have been dragged out with them. Maybe if she‚Äôd been less of a traitorous bitch, she wouldn‚Äôt have made the call.</p>
<p>So she read her banned books on the roof, smoking like she shouldn‚Äôt, sometimes hoping someone would come up there and shoot her for it.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/foreignfoto.jpg"/> <p><strong>Even as Vekllei people suffer</strong>, in the postwar troubles and demographic crises of their fledgling utopia, the media apparatuses of Vekllei have become highly skilled at documenting and confronting suffering here and around the world.</p>
<p>Vekllei people are, by any metric, exquisite documentarians. Fifty years ago, all news reporting was subject to censor by the insecure Atlantic Junta. Today, Vekllei has cultivated timely, comprehensive and impactful journalism among its disparate news organisations and film units. Pioneers of film camera technology, Vekllei journalism is not situated as a point of national pride but an international duty, in the spirit of the United Nations.</p>
<p>Most of Vekllei&rsquo;s news-of-record is consolidated under the <strong>Vekllei Telegraph and Record Administration</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> as the <strong>Vekllei Press Bureau</strong><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> (PB), which is not a single publication or broadcaster but several. Much like any other bureau, it acts as a trade association ‚Äî in this case, a correspondent&rsquo;s club ‚Äî in which multiple industry leaders co-operate under the bureau frameworks. A bureau helps with funding and political support, and also fosters cooperation (and manages grievances) between Vekllei&rsquo;s news media.</p>
<p><strong>ForeignFoto</strong> is the foreign correspondent arm of the Vekllei Press Bureau. Although it cuts together its own documentaries, it is mostly made up of freelancers making their own way around the world. It was formed shortly after independence to cover the War in Taiwan, where it produced several groundbreaking films on sexual assault among British and Vekllei troops, and the Fall of Kaohsiung. These films were later used as evidence in the Taipei Trials.</p>
<p>ForeignFoto is also by far the most dangerous unit in Vekllei&rsquo;s overseas journalism. With its origins in war photography, ForeignFoto embeds themselves on the front lines, often undercover, and wherever the going gets tough. Many of its greatest reporters have died dramatic deaths: Simon Nowak was killed in a helijet crash, Sofia Phillips was assassinated by the Stasi, and George Stephens was murdered. Each of them contributed tremendously to the cinematic record of the 21st Century, in ways that have benefited all mankind.</p>
<p>Although documentary films are screened in Vekllei every evening as part of cinema news programmes, the <strong>International Press</strong> (IP) distributes ForeignFoto&rsquo;s footage and work to news organisations worldwide, with the condition they remain free, unaltered and non-proprietary.¬† The IP is an initiative of the Vekllei Press Bureau and the <strong>International Federation of Journalists</strong> (a global union of journalists and UNESCO affiliate) to foster free press and open reporting. The IP archive, located in the International Federation of Journalist&rsquo;s building in Vekllei Proper, is perhaps the most comprehensive archive of news footage in the world.</p>
<p>Tzipora never worked for ForeignFoto, but did accredit the <em>Montre Student Gazette</em> with the Vekllei Press Bureau during her tenure as Editor-in-Chief in 2078. This accreditation allowed her to install the <em>Gazette</em>&rsquo;s first foreign correspondent in Paris later that year.</p>

<p><strong>Such was spring</strong>. The breeze was cool, but the sun was warm on the skin and everywhere. They‚Äôd been driving for a couple hours, Tzipora and Baron. They‚Äôd crossed the big glacier and come down the other side into <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/troll/">Troll</a>, where there was nothing much for miles around. It was about then that their tyre blew and the little Cosme M40 limped over to the side of the road.</p>
<p>Lemons and lemonade; Tzipora decided it was time for lunch. They ate canned salmon in the sun. She‚Äôd baked olive bread the day before and they pulled it apart with their hands. After lunch they opened a bottle and Baron had a cigarette as he figured out how he was going to get the spare out from under the luggage in the front.</p>
<p>Tzipora had no such concerns. They had plenty of wine and didn‚Äôt have to be in Fyori until tonight. The bonnet of the Cosme had heated up in the sun and it was warm on her back. Tzipora was getting to the good part of her favourite book. The radio had a good song on. She was living one of the best moments of her life.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/seispri.jpg"/> <p><strong>Vekllei is a land of spirits</strong>. All things have some life to them, but spirits are something special. Up in Tiyousn, seispri (lit. spirits) wander freely, attracted by sulphur and silica waste pools discharged by the Magma-Electric Flash Plant nearby. Rich with minerals and warm to the touch, these milky ponds are gathering places for creatures of the spirit world.</p>
<p>Vekllei people do not understand spirits; they will never understand spirits. The word itself is nearly meaningless, applied broadly to any creature crossing over from unseen spatial cages. The only thing that characterises a spirit is its human intelligence and, by association, their complicated personalities. Most appreciate gestures, even misplaced ones, so it never hurts to leave offerings and announce your intentions in Vekllei‚Äôs autonomous Crown Lands.</p>
<p>Tzipora was outside of Equetti, in Tiyousn, looking for mineral pools that were the right temperature to bathe in. Finding a favourite mineral pool was a right of passage in Vekllei, and locations to good ones were often secrets given only to close friends and family.</p>
<p>She was about two kilometres south of the Flash Plant when she saw it and screamed.</p>
<p>Spirits always provoke raw terror the first time. They are not of nature; they are like humans. Their intelligence distinguishes them from the physicality of their surrounds and complicates their behaviour with cultural constructions. It is not like seeing an animal. It is like seeing beyond the horizon of death and the things that live beyond it.</p>
<p>Tzipora was now looking at herself, dressed in some approximation of the things she wore. She thought it was here to kill her. Shaking, and stupidly, she spoke to it like a reflection in a mirror: ‚ÄúYou scared me.‚Äù</p>
<p>At first she thought it might be a demon ‚Äî a creature that hurt people. But it ‚Äî Tzipora did not know what else to call it ‚Äî sat facing herself, staring unblinkingly. Demons didn‚Äôt sit; they beat you to death.</p>
<p>Tzipora had been doing a lot of reading about spirits, but had no real reference for this apparition. It would be a terrible thing to run away ‚Äî she‚Äôd probably offend the spirit, and it was bad manners anyway. She did not know what to do, so Tzipora said hello and introduced herself, and then said something nice about the weather. She spoke slowly, carefully. The spirit sat there, looking at her.</p>
<p>Tzipora asked about the mineral ponds, and if there were good springs to bathe in, but the spirit said nothing. It looked as real as herself ‚Äî the lichen on the rock was disturbed beneath the spirit‚Äôs skirt. Her skirt, actually ‚Äî was the spirit pulling its outfit from Tzipora‚Äôs mind? Could it sense thoughts? She kept talking politely, about how nice the walk out here was. She paused for a moment and worked up the courage for a compliment, then told the spirit she liked its clothes. She was worried it might provoke a response, but the spirit stayed still.</p>
<p>Her heart was pounding, but Tzipora could suppress fear. She opened her pack and pulled out her lunch, spreading it out next to the mineral pool before them. She had a bar of Gosmo milk chocolate. She asked if the spirit would like some. She unwrapped the foil, looking at it, and broke off a row of squares. She put two squares in her own mouth, and took the other two squares and held it out. The spirit didn‚Äôt move. Moving slowly, Tzipora reached over gently and placed the chocolate on its arm. As she did so, her fingertip brushed its arm ‚Äî her own arm ‚Äî and she was filled with unease. It was as real as she was; its arm was warm to the touch.</p>
<p>Tzipora had stopped chewing her chocolate. It melted on her tongue. In the back of her mind she thought about getting a cavity. A moment later, the spirit and the chocolate disappeared. It just stopped being there. Tzipora looked around, afraid it might be sneaking up on her, but it was gone.</p>
<p>She broke off two more squares, packed her sandwich back into her pack and walked briskly back to Equetti. As she passed by the ponds, her fear eased ‚Äî there was some abstract sense, perhaps, that she had been invited here. Maybe spirits liked chocolate.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/gun.jpg"/> <p><strong>Baron had been working in the twilight of violence for over twenty years</strong>. In that time he had not given much thought to children or family, except for those that lingered as ghosts from long ago. Despite popular misconception, Baron did on occasion daydream, and in those daydreams was an abstract picture of his heir ‚Äî a dark-haired son not unlike himself.</p>
<p>Tzipora was not a son but she was not unlike him. She gave him a new perspective on life ‚Äî a reason for going on, and a universe outside of service to the state. And how she adored him. She demonstrated that in how she talked, and how she childishly defended any casual observation or guessing of him. They were old friends ‚Äî war buddies, in fact ‚Äî and spent many evenings talking about the world and the things in it. Yet a paternal dimension of their relationship existed. Tzipora was young and full of questions, and wanted desperately to be taught. So he guided her when she asked for it, and answered her questions. And there were so many questions.</p>
<p>In his daydreams he taught his son to use the gun. There were guns in the home but Tzipora was not allowed to touch them, because she had been prescribed antipsychotics fourteen months into her life in Vekllei. She didn‚Äôt end up needing the pills; they only gave her tremors. It wasn‚Äôt until she was diagnosed properly at eighteen years of age that she as allowed to use the guns with Baron.</p>
<p>They went hunting for meat, since there had been more shortages that year, and in summer Vekllei is full of a most obscure pest called a Pademelon ‚Äî a type of Australian wallaby that had been introduced just prior to the War by accident. Now they were all over, inoffensive as they were. The meat was tasty and the government encouraged you to cull them, so they were hunted commonly. Tzipora had some knowledge of how to use a pistol but hadn‚Äôt fired a long gun. Baron showed her how to use the sites and hold it. She didn‚Äôt kill anything, but Baron bagged two. Tzipora figured out how to skin and clean the animal and they ate wallaby steaks that night, which tasted good but were gamey. She shared the rest of the meat with a neighbour who had helped her repair the boiler.</p>
<p>In the echoes of Baron‚Äôs memory was a distant, youthful dream of riding a motorbike overseas, maybe across Asia or through the Middle East. Eating from street vendors and sleeping wherever you could. Was it so crazy? After twenty years of work he had plenty of money to withdraw for travel. He wondered if Tzipora would like to learn to ride a motorbike ‚Äî and what she‚Äôd think of such an idea.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/generation.jpg"/> <p><strong>Children of the children of the bomb ‚Äî</strong> a generation of war-babies born in peacetime. That was how they thought of themselves. Their grandparents and great-grandparents had lived through the war and the occupation, and so they had inherited the burden of Vekllei&rsquo;s future as a country of long-sufferers, visionaries, and dispossessed.</p>
<p>Some Marxist continental intellectual had said something a half-century ago about the right way to teach children, and the idea had probably caught the ear of some commissar of the Vekllei interim government, who perhaps passed it along to some bureaucrat rebuilding the government schools. As a result, Vekllei children only go to school three or four days a week. There, they spend only a few hours a day in classrooms. There is, after all, no real workforce for which they are being primed. <a href="https://millmint.net/posts/2020-07-13-economy/#play">Vekllei&rsquo;s labour economy is a play-fantasy</a>, and so they mostly learn how to play.</p>
<p>It is not designed to &lsquo;free&rsquo; children ‚Äî Vekllei schools have hierarchies, punishments and are mandatory &mdash; instead, the primary goal of education is self-discovery and self-respect. It is precisely these qualities that benefit most the modern Vekllei economy, which is heavily automated and competes internationally through the product of its participatory creative thinking.</p>
<p>There is no grading system in Vekllei ‚Äî all classes are passed or failed. The value of compulsory education through government schools, then, is the socialisation of boys and girls with others boys and girls, and the availability of equipment and facilities to participate in extracurricular activities. This is the real body of Vekllei school life ‚Äî its clubs, societies, and individual associations. Many professional photographers in this country discovered an affection for photography before they turned 15 years old, through exposure to it in school. These resources, and the need to socialise children with others, are the reasons the Vekllei government continues to universalise government schooling, even alongside home-schooling or independent/religious education.</p>
<p>Depicted here are the good-natured youth of the new generation in school uniform ‚Äî <a href="https://millmint.net/posts/2020-09-08-uniforms/">a topic we&rsquo;ve visited before</a>. All students in Vekllei wear the same uniform, including at university. The uniforms themselves are not designed specifically to regulate appearance ‚Äî and to this end, schools do not have dress codes regarding hair or cultural/religious accessories including jewellery.</p>
<p>Discard any assumptions about the meaning behind the colour or style of their clothes ‚Äî all variations depicted here can be worn by whomever, no matter their age, school or association. In fact, school uniforms are not provided directly by schools ‚Äî they are found at department stores, on the rack alongside suits and dresses. Because of this fact, specific styles of shirt, trousers, socks and shoes vary between students ‚Äî and are acceptable as long as they meet the basic requirements of the uniform. This intersection of control and anarchy can be found widely throughout broader Vekllei society, and is an interesting example of how the basic principles of the &ldquo;Vekllei way of life&rdquo; are reflected in the microscopic mundanities of life and foundations of national culture simultaneously.</p>

<p>‚Äî Walter Benjamin, <em>On the Concept of History</em>, 1942</p>
<p><strong>Tzipora remembered living in the twilight of the dying world</strong>, and how quiet it seemed in Vekllei in those years. It had an effect on the air; on the grass. Tzipora was very good at admiring the mundane, and the spaces it inhabited.</p>
<p>Landscape is all around us, all of the time. It does not just occur in scenery, or in nature. And it can be very difficult to see landscape for what it is, because our interiors &mdash; our selves &mdash; announce themselves constantly. In order to enjoy the quiet physicality of everyday life, you have to quiet that voice. What is left is the senses, and intuition.</p>
<p>Vekllei was full of these sensory feelings, because it was full of physical things. It was breaking down, one after the other, the mental burdens of modernity. Not just in big ways; in money and in work. But in small ways too, in how we experienced places and how we thought of and understood our possessions. Upen explicitly describes an animism &mdash; all things are alive. But you don&rsquo;t need to believe in Upen to understand that, it&rsquo;s evident throughout Vekllei. The complicated, nonsensical machinations of Vekllei society: <a href="https://millmint.net/posts/2020-07-13-economy/">moneylessness</a>; <a href="https://millmint.net/posts/2020-10-11-metaphysic/">product atheism</a>; <a href="https://millmint.net/posts/2021-07-21-fashion/">antifashions</a>; <a href="https://millmint.net/posts/2019-11-01-schools/">childlessness</a>; <a href="https://millmint.net/posts/2020-12-05-gods/">an absence of landscape</a>, <a href="https://millmint.net/posts/2021-05-31-topet/">abstractionism</a>, <a href="https://millmint.net/posts/2021-04-01-woman/">a reclamation of womanhood</a>, etc. &mdash; they could not be more simple in Vekllei, where the beautiful products of such things are unannounced and plain to see. Simplicity is in fact complicated; Vekllei is complicated, and life there is simple.</p>
<p>She still had her anxiety, of course. She was a full-colour constellation of neuroses. But living was not hard; Vekllei was approaching its epoch of rest. When it arrives, no one will notice a thing.</p>
<p><em>Big things coming soon.</em></p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/antifashion.jpg"/> <p><strong>For most of her life, Tzipora dressed how she was told to dress</strong>. When she was a child, her clothes were provided. When she started school, the school clothed her. After school, heading west on the trains and picking up work as she found it, she wore whatever she could afford.</p>
<p>Up until her first steps inside the Cozetti Department Store in Vekllei, clothing was for gazing, not for being gazed at. Her new identity as a modern, middle-class girl had yet to emerge. It was a vacuum that needed filling in a new country where social behaviour drove your quality of life.</p>
<p>Clothing in Vekllei is manufactured by the same ideological forces that seek to ‚Äúdeindustrialise‚Äù the economic processes of the country ‚Äî in other words, its broad physical decommodification. This included a championing of what they indigenously called ‚Äúfashion atheism‚Äù or ‚Äúantifashions,‚Äù meaning fashion that was not designed to be sold. This did not necessarily require a return to the woollen jumpers and seal pelts of yesteryear ‚Äî just that clothing would return to the physical immediacy of art and architecture. It became what Vekllei people call ‚Äúthe decoration of ordinary life;‚Äù in other words, simply decorative and exclusively physical, and unburdened by intellectual or economic fetishisms.</p>
<p>This position is inherently conservative, in the sense that it was not supposed to change quickly, but the appearance of Vekllei‚Äôs ‚Äúantifashions‚Äù did not advocate for traditional native styles specifically ‚Äî indeed, many antifashions were quite radical both aesthetically and ideologically, and were pioneered by some of Vekllei‚Äôs most progressive art communities.</p>
<p>Employing Tzipora as an example here is not just a convenience of the project ‚Äî she is a superb example of how the internationalist movement became a symbol of the global dispossessed. Her tastes were affected by her exposure to a unique style developed in the Vekllei-Italian immigrant design schools called ‚ÄúNuova Grotessco Internazionale,‚Äù (Lit. International New Grotesque), which helped found her affection for simple clothing in simple colours.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGrotesque‚Äù in this case comes from the Italian grotessco, a reference to forms so simple they could have been pulled from cave paintings. Although Tzipora was too sensible to ever seek them out, the showcase items of the Nuova Grotessco Internazionale movement were radical in their geometric simplicity ‚Äî advocating androgynous silhouettes and ‚Äúculturelessness‚Äù that looked like it came from nowhere and said nothing. Like all radical fashions, the dramatic conclusions of these ideas were moderated and filtered into general consumption in Vekllei, which went on to contribute to the popularity of new synthetic materials, space-age ‚Äúcosmocorps‚Äù styles and bright geometric patterns common in the country.</p>
<p>Tzipora herself was never much for the grotesque, but she was very interested in internationalist styles. She had a few choice clothing items she reproduced in most of her outfits ‚Äî she liked that her pleated shirts suggested nothing about her personality, her ethnic background, or her immigrant status. The pleated shirt is simply the ‚Äúdecoration of ordinary life.‚Äù It was inoffensive and uncomplicated. Such is the spirit of fashion atheism and the internationalist movement: clothing should suggest nothing intrinsic about you.</p>
<p>In Vekllei, this idea was seen as a critical liberator of women, and elsewhere, it was seen as an extension of international democracy and cooperation; an aesthetic of endless social mobility and freedom of expression. In Vekllei, where art was very radical and influenced heavily by continental designers, it was the ultimate symbol of postwar egalitarianism and recovery. The internationalist style has become the ‚Äònew default‚Äô of Vekllei fashion, obscuring its ideological origins through its presence in (and simple decoration of) everyday life.</p>

<p><strong>I write introspectively about the project sometimes,</strong> as a means by which I consider what I&rsquo;m doing and where my unconscious is leading me with this project. I have the instinct of someone who is over-educated and self-obsessed; someone who went to university, fell for the farce of serious media criticism, and failed to see that all media theorists are basically freaks. And there is a small truth buried in that hyperbole: it does in fact require a certain dysfunction to write books about the study of anime or television. You can become <em>too</em> close to something.</p>
<p><em>Utopie concr√®te,</em> or &lsquo;concrete utopia,&rsquo; is my phrase for how I work. I saw parallels with the manifesto of <em>musique concr√®te</em>, as described by Pierre Schaeffer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of notating musical ideas on paper with the symbols of <em>solf√®ge</em> and entrusting their realisation to well-known instruments, the question was to collect concrete sounds, wherever they came from, and to abstract the musical values they were potentially containing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Utopianism is much the same; it distills the concrete sentiment, concerns, and futures of a time and place and reproduces them in abstract in fiction. In a very straightforward way, my work (Vekllei, so-called) is an abstraction of real people, events, and things.</p>
<p>It also refers to the &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; of Vekllei, in a transcendental fashion. Utopianism is associated with very specific, loaded conceptions of perfection &mdash; cleanliness, symmetry, peacefulness, goodness, and impossibility. Vekllei is not any of these things consistently; it is like the raw concrete used in <em>b√©ton brut</em>, and like raw concrete it discolours, weathers and crumbles in its exposure to reality and the march of time. You can see the formwork and imperfections in its product &mdash; not as a result of sloppy workmanship or carelessness, but because those things are beautiful; utopian in their own right.</p>
<p>At the risk of disfiguring these notes into a manifesto, the principles of <em>utopie concr√®te</em> might look something like this.</p>
<p>PRINCIPLES OF <strong>UTOPIE CONCR√àTE</strong> ‚ñ†</p>
<ol>
<li>All things have dignity</li>
<li>All things get dirty</li>
<li>You must love it</li>
</ol>
<p>To explain further:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>All things have dignity</strong>. You must take your &ldquo;raw utopia&rdquo; seriously &mdash; it has to be honest. In this sense, you must always aim to do your best for it. Consider your landscape and give your characters the respect you would anyone. If you dishonour them through sloppy work, you should feel embarrassed.¬†</li>
<li><strong>All things get dirty</strong>. In order to &lsquo;consider your landscape&rsquo; and &lsquo;respect your characters,&rsquo; you must also recognise that these things need to live independently from your control. The activity of your utopia is what makes it alive, and also what makes it imperfect. Recognise the imperfections and celebrate them.¬†</li>
<li><strong>You must love it</strong>. Utopias are very thoughtful and considered, but they can&rsquo;t be intellectual. It must be intuitive &mdash; follow your heart.</li>

<p><strong>UTOPIE CONCR√àTE</strong> ‚ñ† WITH <strong>VEKLLEI</strong> ‚ù¶ CHARACTERISTICS</p>
<p>You already have the tools to create your concrete utopia &mdash; you just need to act on it. I have acted, and what has surfaced reveals a great deal about me, how I think and process the world, my anger and prejudices, my hopes and affections, and the pettiest of petty material interests.</p>
<p>Hayao Miyazaki, a great artist I admire deeply, was asked why his films starred heroines. He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At first, I thought &ldquo;this is no longer the era of men&hellip;&rdquo; But after ten years, I grew tired of saying that. I just say &ldquo;because I like women.&rdquo; That has more reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mostly draw women, and there is not much good reason for it other than I like women.</p>
<p>I have said previously I&rsquo;m deeply uncomfortable with the conceptual objectification of women, and the shallowness of girl-caricatures. Yet, when asked why my cast of characters are mostly women, I can only say that I like drawing women. That&rsquo;s very revealing of the hypocritical discrepancy between essay rhetoric and my body of work. I try and give my characters dignity, but I also draw women and girls because they might look more interesting in a certain profession, or have better options for their clothes. Where is the dignity in being reproduced for how you appear in a picture? We can&rsquo;t mistake &ldquo;drawing women&rdquo; for &ldquo;representation of women.&rdquo; This is a failing on my part.</p>
<p>But I also think that Tzipora, the most egregious and unusual example of &ldquo;using the appearance of women&rdquo; in my project, is not much of a woman at all. She carries my anger, my obsessiveness, and lives my fantasy of a meaningful life. She is quite explicitly an author surrogate, although with a life of her own. She is also not supposed to be an authentic depiction of the experience of any woman &mdash; she is in fact closer to an anti-woman. She is so tomboyish, obsessive, and neurotic, that it&rsquo;s hard to use her to explore conventional literary interests in &lsquo;womanhood.&rsquo; Thank goodness for that &mdash; it&rsquo;s not my place.</p>
<p>Creating Vekllei is my way of processing the goings-on of the world, and my lived experience day-to-day. In this sense, I prefer the clothes and appearance of women, and so in my utopia I draw women.</p>
<p>This is one of the interesting contradictions of utopianism. It is inherently egoistic, and can always be traced cleanly to the total worldview and personality of its author. But like most fiction, authors are eager to give life to their people and places, and would rather you not glimpse the man behind the curtain. Vekllei is fiction &mdash; Tzipora is a girl, and lives in Vekllei. Vekllei is also a utopia &mdash; Tzipora is me, and lives in my hopes, dreams, and anxieties. The contradiction is muted until authors start acting like the former is not a result of the latter, and that my personal experience does not affect who and what is depicted in Vekllei. This is true of all fiction &mdash; so let us not pretend cuteness is not a female burden, and my desire to draw nice clothes and interesting hairstyles is not an altruistic representation of women, no matter how well-intentioned my depictions may be.</p>
<p>This conversation is important only because Vekllei is important (to me), and the principles of <em>utopie concr√®te</em> are worth upholding &mdash; all things <em>must</em> have dignity.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/compor.jpg"/> <p><strong>Where Tzipora lived in Lola</strong>, most people remained of the working class well into the utopian period. Despite their equitable access to the fruits of the country, their housing was poorer and their problems generational. Alcoholism was very common; many of them were veterans of the War in Taiwan. Others were in great pain from their early work in the postwar years, their bodies broken by the demons of manual labour.</p>
<p>A year after Tzipora arrived, the conviction of a Polish man for two murders sparked protests in Lola along ethnic lines. Protests were very common in Vekllei. In the postwar years, the grievances were often prejudiced, and intensified by the millions of immigrants who arrived in the renewed country, one which was reestablishing itself as a place of dignity for dispossessed people.</p>
<p>Tzipora did not like the protests because they reminded her of where she came from. Per the echoes of the past, she too found old wartime anxiety and despair resurfacing. She was feeling what we now call battle fatigue, or the neurosis of violence ‚Äî but she did not look like a soldier, and so she was not treated for it.</p>
<p>And that sort of thing brought out the monster in Tzipora. She grappled with her own revulsion towards the anti-immigrant protestors. It upset her hearing the protests from her home. In her mind, she would like to see them shot where they stood. How short-sighted was tolerance in abstract ‚Äî why did no one seem to recognise that people needed management; they all needed management. They needed management from their own worst instincts! She had seen the wickedness of people, and now it had followed her here!</p>
<p>The protest had fizzled out by sundown. Baron watched it from the roof with a drink, apparently unconcerned. Tzipora found herself shaking with anger and had to return inside.</p>
<p>The following day, she passed by some riot officers on the way to school. She signed at them in her new <a href="https://millmint.net/factbook/society/culture/language/#5-potenne">Potenne</a> to say they were doing good work. That was all she said. In her head, she was thinking <em>get them! Go and arrest them all. How can you just stand there and watch?</em></p>
<p>The moment would pass, and the thoughts would settle. She was not bloodthirsty in her heart. But that side of her threatened to surface from time to time. There was some currency to the thought that she had died overseas, and she was witnessing a life unlived in the twilight of death. There is a truthfulness to anger. That side of her felt much more ‚Äòreal‚Äô for a long time after. That problem remained unresolved throughout most of her life.</p>
<hr>
<p>The <strong>Cosmpasnie Fedecenoayan Porits</strong>, or <em>Compor</em> (lit. National Police Companies), are the special paramilitary and riot control wing of the National Police, or <a href="/factbook/society/state/government/interior/defence/#police-of-the-parliament">venopor</a>. Most police in Vekllei are stationed locally, including the National Police. The Companies, however, are mobile ‚Äî they move to meet riots, participate in counter-terrorism and counter-espionage operations, and support the Royal Vekllei Armed Forces in wartime.</p>
<p>Depicted here is a riot officer in ‚Äúsilks,‚Äù the term for the Compor uniform including revolver and long truncheon. Besides her is an armoured officer of Special Tactics, which responds to serious threats of violence. The iconic Compor shield is displayed here for documentary purposes. Special Tactics carry powerful radios designed to work in all environments.</p>
<p>Vekllei sees protests regularly for all sorts of things, including ongoing economic grievances, cultural tension, or even more commonly political events designed to pressure government. All such occasions are met with the Compor, who are feared and reviled by a country otherwise only used to local policing.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/spiritful.jpg"/> <p><strong>There was not much different about one spirit than another</strong>. Foreigners mistook Upen, the animism of Vekllei, for environmentalism ‚Äî that was not the case at all. Landscapes changed, and so did the things that lived in them.</p>
<p>Of course, humans are sentimental creatures, and they become attached to native things. It is important to seperate human desire ‚Äî the protection of native plants and animals ‚Äî and the interests of spirits, since they are not the same.</p>
<p>Upen is at the heart of how a Vekllei person understands the world. It describes the basis of all being, and the essence of all things, called <em>seispri</em>, lit. ‚Äòspirits‚Äô. Some spirits are large and complex, and can resemble creatures. Others are so small and quiet, no person could ever see them. We‚Äôll look at these later.</p>
<p>Tzipora is wearing traditional ritual dress. Spirits are attracted to interesting things, especially precious metals and fine materials, and so outfits like these are designed to attract their attention. Smart people dress for the occasion, and to talk to spirits you must look like a spirit.</p>
<p>Her hat is called a <em>kitpek</em>, lit. ‚Äòflat hat,‚Äô precisely because you can fold it flat. A wide-brimmed version is still worn in agriculture today. This narrow-brim version is elegant and feminine, and decorated with gold and orange. In summer, shirts stitched with gold like these can be worn. In winter, elaborate capes take their place. You can also see here the earliest form of the <em>gi</em> still in use today, resting to the right of its sister-ornament, the <em>jouvismoakoisnisn</em> belt, with two large tassels. The <em>gi</em> is still worn commonly, and is even part of school uniform. The <em>jouvismoakoisnisn</em> is not so lucky, and today is only associated with Upen ritual.</p>
<p>Her special tool is called a <em>duapolutchi</em>, lit. ‚Äòtwin lights,‚Äô which consists of a mounting stick and two hollow wooden balls filled with seeds. You shake it to announce the start of a meeting, or express happiness. For good measure, Tzipora has also slung gold chord around her neck and arms. All in all, a captivating show for most spirits.</p>
<p>In ritual dress, you are supposed to only communicate via <a href="https://millmint.net/factbook/society/culture/language/#6-upotenne">Upotenne</a>, which is the physical language of runes. It‚Äôs a form of sign language that incorporates the whole body, and is understood by most Vekllei spirits. Tzipora does not know <em>Upotenne</em> very well, so only says a few words before waving her ball-stick around. With any luck, they‚Äôll shower her with blessings ‚Äî or at the very least, not cause her harm next time she intrudes on them.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/wickets.jpg"/> <p><strong>Tzipora was good at cricket</strong>. That surprised everyone. Her teachers called her bookish; her classmates called her a dork. She didn‚Äôt look like a girl who played much sport. In America, at her old school, she was sick from gym class so regularly that they stopped asking about her absence.</p>
<p>In Vekllei, however, the sports were better. Instead of ‚Äúgym class,‚Äù they had physical education ‚Äî Phys Ed ‚Äî that included a variety of weekly health classes, term carnivals, and daily callisthenics. They‚Äôd pile into the gymnasium, take off dark-soled shoes, and run through simple exercises before lessons. Sometimes they‚Äôd play games instead, if they had one of the cool teachers. That was a potent memory for Tzipora, actually ‚Äî the jealousy of watching the homeroom next door play ‚Äúcrocodile‚Äù while her group were doing stretches for the second time that week.</p>
<p>It was her social environment, in the end, that got her into sports. When she didn‚Äôt know anyone, she‚Äôd read English books by the sports fields. Two weeks into watching the boys play lunchtime cricket, she took up the bat and scored six runs. It turned out Tzipora was very good at sports. She was fast and well-coordinated ‚Äî an uncultivated natural gift. That year, at the athletics carnival, she scored best out of the girls in high jump and best out of anyone in long jump.</p>
<p>That made Tzipora very popular with her classmates, because she played ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù ‚Äî she was a shy geek that was good at cricket and didn‚Äôt mind getting grass stains on her shirt. It was that duality, rather than her sportsmanship, that people liked. She was amusing enough as a character that the sports-playing boys had developed a fascination with her, and they shouted at her to join most lunchtimes. It was paternalistic, sure ‚Äî they liked her in the same way they liked the retarded rough-n-ready rugby boy in their class ‚Äî but it wasn‚Äôt mean-spirited.</p>
<p>Most days, she would. She‚Äôd pull off her armband, unclip her gi, and roll up her skirt and sleeves as she made her way down to the pitch. She‚Äôd come back with dirty knees right to her books, eight runs richer and radiating a casual self-confidence.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/mist.jpg"/> <p><strong>The sky was heavy with grey and water</strong>, and it bled into the air. Vekllei‚Äôs moon months were here, and with it came the end of Vekllei‚Äôs bright summer season. In came the days of coats, mist and darkness.</p>
<p>Tzipora here wears <em>rouisha</em>, loose-fitting felt pants that have been worn in Vekllei for a thousand years. They‚Äôre often worn under a skirt, but can be worn alone as trousers if you like. Today they‚Äôre elasticated around the ankles to insulate your legs. She also wears the ‚Äòstudent cape,‚Äô which is well-known overseas and often held aloft by foreigners as an example of Vekllei‚Äôs cultural sophistication. It is not nearly as special in Vekllei.</p>
<p>A single uniform in Vekllei often includes a variety of colours and styles, since its use is <a href="https://millmint.net/posts/2020-09-08-uniforms/">social rather than conformist</a>. Tzipora demonstrates that well here, in her unfortunate collision of school gold, navy, red, and white.</p>
<p>When the air is mild and the wind is still, the mist feels good. It felt good to be in it. Sometimes it‚Äôs just good to be alive.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/shalom.jpg"/> <p><strong>When they met</strong>, Tzipora told Baron she was Catholic. He thought that was hilarious ‚Äî it was one of the few times she saw him laugh. Her name was ‚ÄúTzipora‚Äù, and she gave herself the name ‚ÄúZelda‚Äù ‚Äî who did she think she was kidding? But that‚Äôs just how she was; Tzipora was an intricate person of many backgrounds and instincts.</p>
<p>Baron was Jewish, but he didn‚Äôt practice much. He did, however, observe shabbas as a cultural legacy of his childhood. He worked six days a week, and rested Saturdays. Sometimes, he‚Äôd put on a roast in the tradition of his late father‚Äôs recipe. Other times, Tzipora would cook some of their favourite foods. Tzipora, the insistent catholic, would respect the melakhot because she liked the idea of it. Even more unusually, she welcomed the shabbas with a prayer, even though her sabbath was Sunday. That‚Äôs just how she was; you get the idea. She was a curious and deeply spiritual person, and became more fascinated with her Jewish heritage after living with Baron.</p>
<p>Cobian didn‚Äôt know what a Jew was; she barely understood the concept of any god. Cobian‚Äôs family were indigenous Vekllei, descended from generations of animistic Upen observers. She was, however, more than willing to break bread with the girl she loved, and they enjoyed many meals together over the years in that picturesque, naive multiculturalism common to Vekllei.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/carnival.jpg"/> <p><strong>Each year</strong>, Lola 6th School traveled to the base of the Thanveler Glacier for its swimming carnival. There was a big thermal pool there, heated by the Earth, and students competed in races for prizes and ribbons.</p>
<p>Tzipora told people she couldn‚Äôt swim. That was true ‚Äî she sank like a stone. But she didn‚Äôt tell them the other part ‚Äî that she never wanted to learn how.</p>
<p>There is a very tragic and pathetic self-consciousness that afflicts kids around her age. Boys and girls went to school together here, but they weren‚Äôt the same thing, were they? She saw girls usually clothed in capes and knee skirts showing skin she‚Äôd never seen before. There was this one girl, Cherrie, who was on the heavy side, and Tzipora marvelled unconsciously at how much bigger she looked without her uniform. She realised what she was doing, and was struck with shame ‚Äî and relief it wasn‚Äôt her in that stupid one-piece.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù Tzipora thought to herself, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôd be me. What I‚Äôm doing now.‚Äù</p>
<p>Tzipora hadn‚Äôt worn a swimsuit since she was a kid in Colombia, and she wasn‚Äôt going to strip off in front of all these people who already judged her. In her mind, she was ugly-skinny, with scars on her shoulders and no figure to speak of. She didn‚Äôt think about these things usually, because all her clothes were a size too big, but a change room changed things.</p>
<p>No; she wouldn‚Äôt wear a swimsuit. She wouldn‚Äôt even take her shoes off. They‚Äôd think she was weird for sitting out, but they thought she was weird anyway. Every swimming carnival from here to graduation she‚Äôd suffer from the poolside ‚Äî reading her books, eating her packed lunch and lying about how well she did to Baron when she got home.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/mossbound.jpg"/> <p><strong>Outside of the cities</strong>, sensory pleasure can be enriched by Vekllei‚Äôs oldest organism, if you know where to look. The temperate rainforest is alive, and breathing, and smells cold in its freshness. The perfume of the rainforest is earthy and chilled, swirling in a cocktail of fresh water, rich, damp soil and the scents of thick mosses and browning leaves. Out here, only water and the trees move ‚Äî these sounds are the domain of spirits.</p>
<p>Even bird calls seem foreign here, as though the plovers and crows had been invited by the same mossbound instinct Tzipora shared. Pushing deeper into the rainforest, the risks become greater but the chance of meeting spirits swells. You are a guest, you are a guest ‚Äî she keeps this in mind if she has any sense. The spirits tolerate breakage but they won‚Äôt tolerate disrespect.</p>
<p>Much as the birds nest and feed, Tzipora is welcomed by the spirits to establish a presence in the rainforest. Taking a seat on the soft floor of the forest, she opens her textbook and reads slowly.</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt wear a jacket ‚Äî the cool air is good for the skin. Breathe deep ‚Äî the perfume is good for the lungs. Open your senses to the peripheral stimuli of the spirit-forest, and don‚Äôt overthink it. Enjoy the sound of wind moving through the ceiling around you, and the freshwater creek that trickles sweetly. This is a good-natured place, so be good-natured.</p>
<p>Tzipora closes her textbook and lies in the moss, listening for spirits. They‚Äôre all around her. They talk to her through the sounds of the forest. If she can fill her soul with good things, they might reveal themselves to her one day. Until then, she meets them as a guest and an admirer, and gives thanks in her heart for their continued stewardship of this place.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/topet.jpg"/> <p>This is an unusual post in that, a) it‚Äôs particularly text-heavy and desaturated, and b) much of its material is already available on an existing <a href="http://www.millmint.net/factbook/society/culture/language">wiki article</a> on my website.</p>
<p>The above article covers the language conceptually in pretty much all the detail you‚Äôd ever want. So, despite the heavy use of labels and text, this picture is particularly concerned with the literal appearance and structure of the Vekllei written language, called <a href="http://millmint.net/factbook/society/culture/language/#3-topet"><em>Topet</em></a>.</p>
<p>As an aside, a basic overview of the language was given <a href="https://millmint.net/posts/2020-11-14-language/">in this post</a>. Please check it out to make sense of some of the terminology used here.</p>
<p><strong>The basic process of Vekllei‚Äôs main writing script (Topet) is this:</strong>‚Ä®</p>
<ol>
<li>Nouns and verbs are modified extensively by associating their subject with other pictographic characters, which have no phonetic value except for the core ‚Äúprinciple‚Äù character. For example, an ‚Äúemu‚Äù might be tall, or ‚Äúrunning‚Äù may be breathless. This grouping is called a ‚Äúminor demon‚Äù.</li>
<li>The way these groupings look depends on how many associated characters you‚Äôre using. The principle can be written alone in the centre of a space. With two, they‚Äôre arranged side-by-side. With three, the principle sits on top of the other two in a triangular shape. With four, they become a quadrant.</li>
<li>Sometimes, these groupings are enough. If everyone already knows what the principle characters means and how to vocalise it, you can leave it alone as a pictograph ‚Äî a literal picture, with meaning modified by the characters of its group.</li>
<li>Quite often, however, you have to teach the reader how to say it. The minor demon lends the initial sound, and the rest have to be written in superscript next to it, as phonetic ‚Äúhelper‚Äù characters called hieyerette. These aren‚Äôt used as pictures, they‚Äôre used to help spell it out.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, Vekllei has <a href="http://millmint.net/factbook/society/culture/language/#1-overview">several verbal, non-verbal, signed and written languages</a>. They don‚Äôt all work like this. Rapotenne is basically pictographic and is very, very old. It‚Äôs mostly used for names and to talk to spirits. It‚Äôs never used for conventional writing. Indeed, for signatures, most use their sigils instead.</p>
<p>So this post isn‚Äôt really intended to help you understand how the Vekllei language works, since the language is very complex and better served by the wiki article linked above. This is a showcase of style ‚Äî the way the Vekllei language looks and feels on paper.</p>
<p>You can see an example of Topet styling in this picture.</p>
<ol>
<li>Modern, sans-serif FLORAL STYLING is most commonly used today in print, as part of the simplification and standardisation of characters. It‚Äôs designed to be easier to write for immigrants, who arrived in Vekllei by the millions after the war.</li>
<li>Traditional, ornamented DEMONIC STYLING carries the traditional line weights and decoration of prewar Topet, and is still used in small print like novels for its better legibility.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most fonts in Vekllei follow in either of these two traditions.</p>
<p>Finally, this infographic makes clear the basic flow of the Vekllei language, which transforms most words into complicated, sentence-like concepts layered with designed, unique meaning. ‚ÄúMinor Demons‚Äù (the character groups) are not just used for poetry but in fact for all writing, as is the nature of Vekllei communication.</p>
<p>Like much else in the country, a lot of the Vekllei way of thinking is deeply conceptual and abstracted, and rarely ventures into modern literalism. This is a feature built into the language, and it affects the Vekllei understanding of many cultural artefacts. For example, the Vekllei language is not really built to describe specific places ‚Äî instead, the feeling and experience of mountains/beaches/streams is substituted in its place, quite literally by the pictographic nature of Topet.</p>
<p>When you read Topet, you‚Äôre not just sounding out a phonetic character ‚Äî you are looking at a picture of that concept, in a transcendental fashion that prohibits specificity. This sort of indigenous conceptualisation deserves a post of its own, but hopefully this graphic has helped introduce you to the basic cadence and features of the written Vekllei word.</p>
<p>Let me know, as always, if you have any questions.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/forever.jpg"/> <p><strong>There‚Äôs no other way to put it ‚Äî Tzipora is one of a kind</strong>. There are others like her, but fewer and fewer of them are born healthy as the years roll on. Her life is hard, she‚Äôd agree, but it‚Äôs also sprinkled with miracles. Meeting her, you might not even know she‚Äôs set to become the oldest person in history.</p>
<p>All stories settle on remarkable people, and Tzipora ‚Äî with or without her absurd long-livedness ‚Äî is a person of importance, and much more than the sum of her parts.</p>
<p>For those unaware, Tzipora is the 13th person in the world to be diagnosed with Gregori-Heitzfeld Disease (GHD), a genetic disorder that surfaced in the 21st Century. Many more than 13 preceded her, but few ‚ÄúGregori babies,‚Äù as they‚Äôre called, ever make it to a hospital for a diagnosis. Where exactly GHD came from depends on who you ask ‚Äî the synthetic preservatives in food? Residual radiation, from a century of atomic testing? The over-sexualisation of media? Tzipora accidentally swallowed a lead ball as a child ‚Äî that‚Äôs as good a guess as any.</p>
<p>Gregori babies do not grow up, and they do not die of old age.</p>
<p>She makes up part of the ‚Äúfirst wave‚Äù of Gregori discovery, comprising of about fifty individual cases across fifteen years starting in the late 2050s. These boys and girls are, on average, healthier and less affected physically by their disease than those born today. Fatal rates of GHD have increased dramatically in recent years, and very few ‚ÄòGregori babies‚Äô born today live beyond 24 months after onset. Like a passing comet, the miracle children seem to be vanishing as quickly as they appeared.</p>
<p>It is commonly misunderstood that Gregori children don‚Äôt reach puberty. This is not quite true ‚Äî they do in fact undergo hormonal changes that usually signal the biological transition into sexual maturity, but are a victim of a poorly-understood protein dysfunction that affects their development and cell reproduction.</p>
<p>Gregori-Heitzfeld, as poorly understood as it is, is not a single malfunction of the human body. It is the intersection of two distinct genetic failings in critical proteins that occur in the oestrogen receptors and enzymes of the body. Let‚Äôs have a look at how this works, to the best of contemporary understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Oestradiol</strong> is an oestrogen that binds to subtypes of the body‚Äôs oestrogen receptors. Of interest here is the agonistic reaction it exerts on a receptor known as the <strong>G protein-coupled oestrogen receptor</strong> (GPER), a protein responsible for oestradiol‚Äôs nongenomic signalling effect on cells. After activation, GPERs exert dramatic and varied effects on the regulation of many parts of the body, including cell growth, and is found not just in oestrogen-receptive tissues but throughout the brain, lungs, skeleton, muscular system and immune cells. In persons suffering from GHD, increased production of oestradiol during puberty onset upregulate GPERs, which has cascading effects on cell production throughout the body, mostly with <strong>gonadotrophin-releasing hormones</strong> (discussed below).</p>
<p>As aforementioned, however, GPER dysfunction is only part of the puzzle. GHD only occurs in the presence of another malfunction of the <strong>telomerase enzyme</strong>, a ribonucleoprotein which extends telomeres in the human chromosome. Prior to GHD onset, the function of the telomerase RNA templates are unaffected, but once malfunctioning GPER proteins are activated by oestradiol enzymes, a local protein misfolding (not dissimilar to prion diseases) occurs that disrupts part of the telomerase catalytic cycle built into the RNA template of the telomerase itself. This affects the pause signal of telomerase DNA synthesis and offsets the natural telomere loss rate in chromosomes, altering cycle lengths of DNA elongation. This is the primary event that contributes to the so-called biological immortality of some Gregori-Heitzfeld patients, since it offsets the loss of most types of somatic cells which would otherwise age and die. In many others, however, the protein misfolding in GPER-telomerase signalling develops into a fatal neurodegenerative disorder called Variant Gregori-Heitzfeld Disease (vGHD). In the last ten years, most ‚ÄòGregori babies‚Äô are in fact victims of vGHD.</p>
<p>The malfunction of GPER proteins also has some kind of affect on the secretion of <strong>gonadotrophin-releasing hormones</strong> (GnRHs), which affect physical development of the body in pubescence. The interaction between GPERs and GnRHs are still poorly understood, and the complicated effects GHD has on this relationship are almost entirely elusive. What is obvious is that most suffering from GHD do not develop physically beyond the onset of the disease, triggered in girls by pubescence sometime between the ages of 12 and 16. In Tzipora‚Äôs case, who perhaps remains the healthiest example of a ‚ÄòGregori baby,‚Äô her puberty is absent despite the increased production of oestrogens triggered by late thelarche. No Gregori baby has ever entered menarche ‚Äî at least in part a result of GnRH suppression by faulty GPER proteins.</p>
<p>The extraordinary rarity of these genetic disorders intersecting contributes to a disease unlike any other. At some point while living in Sacramento, Tzipora slowly stopped ageing. At first, she was just a victim of delayed prepubescence ‚Äî she was underweight, after all. Then, it was a hormone disorder. By the time she was in Vekllei, she was the country‚Äôs first ‚Äúunageing lady.‚Äù</p>
<p>Our understanding of Gregori-Heitzfeld Disease remains rudimentary because, in part, Tzipora makes up most of its scholarship. She is one of the few healthy Gregori babies to voluntarily submit to public medical research, and so most of our understanding comes from her case specifically. There are many gaps in our understanding. Why are Gregori babies not riddled with rapid-growing cancers as their cells metastasise rapidly? Why are the protein misfolds linked to these specific enzymes, and why don‚Äôt they spread throughout the body and brain as they do in vGHD? And, perhaps of most interest to the public ‚Äî where are they going? Why are our new so-called ‚Äúimmortal children‚Äù dying?</p>
<p>Tzipora does not consider herself a ‚ÄòGregori baby,‚Äô because she considers herself ‚ÄòTzipora‚Äô. When she was diagnosed at 16, there were only 10 others like her in the world ‚Äî there was no Gregori community support group. By the time there were hundreds, the disease was rapidly degenerating into vGHD and resembled something closer to a tragic prion disease. These are topics she does not like to think about much.</p>
<p>Vekllei affords her dignity, because it does not have a cultural concept of a child. Children exist, of course. They are loved, and go to school, and learn about the world from guardians around them. But they are afforded dignity as human beings, and generally take on responsibilities at a much younger age. This doesn‚Äôt mean Tzipora‚Äôs life is easy. Her life is not easy. But if she wants to work, she may work. If she wants to travel alone, she may travel alone. And if she wants a glass of wine with dinner, restaurants will accommodate.</p>
<p>These are not special luxuries afforded to her, but basic rights of all young people. In this sense, she is relieved of the inconvenience of justifying her dignity as a person continuously, and allows her to command authority and respect throughout her life.</p>
<p>In the scope of her life, immortality and youthfulness is usually the last thing on her mind.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/hollywood.jpg"/> <p><strong>You know you‚Äôre near the homeland of the Magma-Electric Commission when you smell it.</strong> Somewhere between cracking a rotten egg and standing downwind of a sewerage treatment plant, the volcanic heartlands of Vekllei are the playground of the Magma-Electric Commission, often shortened to just ‚ÄúThe Magma‚Äù or ‚ÄúThunderburo‚Äù. The smell is caused by Hydrogen Sulphide, a byproduct of the naked volcanic activity Vekllei is known for.</p>
<p>Sulphur is everywhere in Vekllei ‚Äî even in the cities, the drinking water smells of it. It even overpowers the perfume of a ro, the Vekllei flower-tundras. In the places where the smell is most intense, you usually find a geothermal power plant nearby.</p>
<p>In Vekllei, The Magma pumps water deep into the belly of the Earth, so deep that the temperature and pressure cause the water to go supercritical, at which point it‚Äôs neither a liquid or a gas. Supercritical water carries much more energy than water or steam, and produces much more electricity ‚Äî so much so that residences in Vekllei are powered entirely by geothermal (Magma-Electric Commission) and hydroelectric (Hydro-Electric Commission) facilities.</p>
<p>There is a so-called ‚Äúflash plant‚Äù in Miyatvousi, in the Lava region of Vekllei. Lava is full of plants like these. A rail line runs near its injection well, where fresh glacial runoff is transformed into clean, limitless electricity through the miracle of its landscape and human ingenuity. The water is recycled, but excess waste water is dumped into the surrounding ro, forming foggy pools of light blue water. The earth here is alive; in the cold, the ponds begin to steam.</p>
<p>Moise had complicated ambitions of becoming a filmmaker. As with all student filmmakers, he drafted his friends to help.</p>
<p>His girlfriend, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/locjnz/turning_things_around/">Coretti</a>, operated the compact 8mm camera. Tzipora was the production assistant, doing makeup and foley and whatever he asked of her. Cobian was going to be a star ‚Äî that‚Äôs what he said to her, anyway, and he paired her up with a mate of his in what would be an epic short film about lost love.</p>
<p>It was Tzipora who suggested Miyatvousi, since she‚Äôd developed a good catalogue of scenic locations in her quest to find natural shrines. There was a place where the rail line crossed a small mineral lake, near the flash plant‚Äôs turbine halls. If worked out just right, you could have a shot that‚Äôd make the whole film. It was a hell of a journey ‚Äî a bullet train in the morning to <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/krafla/">Krafla</a>, where they got breakfast, and a two-hour local train far out from the city.</p>
<p>As it unfolds, you never realise how good a moment is. It was maybe the second or third-best day of Tzipora‚Äôs life. She didn‚Äôt know Coretti all that well, and it was the first time they‚Äôd talked about things other than Moise. They were on a great adventure, and they all knew it. They laughed when Moise coughed out his coffee all over himself and pretended to be interested when Tzipora talked at length about how geothermal power plants work.</p>
<p>At first, the gig had been sort of a joke for Cobian ‚Äî she was humouring the friend of her girlfriend ‚Äî but as the film progressed, she realised how talented and passionate her friends were. They were deeply odd and talented people, and they believed in what they were doing ‚Äî Cobian had never had friends like that before. On the train back to Lola, as the city lights of the capital loomed, Cobian turned to Tzipora and told her that she loved her for the first time.</p>
<p>Ambitious, arrogant, naive, laughing, well-fed, tired, and in love. Looking back, Tzipora thought the candid footage of themselves made better cinema than anything in a theatre. Lights, camera ‚Äî action.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/breakfast.jpg"/> <p><strong>Postwar Vekllei has a problem</strong>. In the old days, many hundreds of years ago, Vekllei‚Äôs long, dark winters forced subsistence farmers to preserve their dishes for six or seven months of the year. This changed under the Junta, which opened trade with the Scandinavian powers, and Vekllei soon saw its growing population dependent on fresh imports of oats and grain from Europe. These Atlantic people, whose diets were previously gamey and nomadic, were now a rough storm away from famine.</p>
<p>Today, the diets are the same but the pressures on food production are even more intense. This island has nearly 22 million people on it. The postwar Vekllei Government is terrified of the vulnerability of its indigenous, isolated ecosystems, and heavily restricts raw food imports. Meanwhile, Vekllei cuisine values freshness, localism and sustainability. These are facts that cannot coexist in a place that cannot reliably grow food outside for half the year.</p>
<p>The simple answer, then, is that Vekllei cuts corners on its food production. It does not attempt to reliably produce meat, which effectively banishes traditional cuisine to rural areas and those willing to hunt puffins themselves. For what animals are slaughtered, all parts of their body are used, and quite often all you‚Äôll find at a butcher is sweetbreads and black pudding. Quality meat is synthetic, grown as isolated cells in massive liquid solutions. Even blood and organs are synthesised in industrial quantities for human consumption. Vegetables, which only entered the mainstream diet of Vekllei in the 20th Century, are grown in huge quantities under sun lamps, powered by limitless fission. The factory process of synthesising foods is called <em>sincrestiprosmaious</em> (lit. <em>Grown/Made Produce</em>, or similar).</p>
<p>With these unusual facts in mind, let‚Äôs take a look at a breakfast feast prepared by Commis Chef Tzipora, which features a selection of indigenous Vekllei breakfast foods.</p>
<p>The basic composition of a Vekllei breakfast is its proteins (egg, meats, and cheese), drinks (coffee, citrus juice, or light breakfast tea), fried or raw vegetables (potato and rutabaga) and sweet items (usually a bun, pastry, or breakfast roll and honey).</p>
<p>The humble <strong>egg</strong> is a staple rarely in short supply in Vekllei, and one or two are scrambled or fried most mornings, often assembled on <strong>rye</strong> with <strong>briga</strong> (a soft Vekllei cheese with a taste similar to feta) and <strong>gos</strong> (bitter Vekllei moss). Scrambled eggs are especially popular due to their availability, a result of their ease of synthesis, and flavoured with <strong>red spice</strong> (factory chilli) or herbs.</p>
<p>Genuine meat is scarce in Vekllei and eaten only occasionally, most commonly in rural areas close to livestock. Most genuine breakfast meats consist of cold, sliced <strong>ham</strong> or <strong>sausages</strong>, which are packed with breadcrumbs due to meat scarcity. Vekllei has a type of blood sausage made of genuine pork blood or synthetic substitutes grown in stem cell hematopoietic vats, which are packed with oatmeal, groats and mint, making a black pudding called <strong>rue bouismesn</strong> (lit. <em>Blood Sausage</em>). Lamb sausages, called <strong>blanc oa bouismesn</strong> (lit. <em>White Sausage</em>) are also common.</p>
<p>Vekllei people drink a lot of <strong>tea</strong> and <strong>coffee</strong> ‚Äî about 7 pounds a year of each. They eat a lot of bread and pastry ‚Äî about 200 pounds a year. They like their butter and lamb, but don‚Äôt go in much for pork. Game, like puffins, are eaten regularly, though less than seafood or lamb. All of these items are eaten with breakfast in various ways, most famously <strong>agne loh lebeau</strong> (lit. <em>Lamb Butter</em>) which is a delicious buttery meat spread for toast, or <strong>lava oa agnetunfisk</strong> (lit. <em>Buttered Lava Tuna</em>), which is cooked until it falls apart and assembled with potatoes and eggs.</p>
<p>Vekllei people like rich, sweet foods, and we can see that here at breakfast. Coffee is sweetened with condensed milk or raw sugar and stirred thoroughly with milk. Tea is much the same. We have here a <strong>long pastri</strong>, a ‚Äúlong pastry‚Äù filled with fruit, which is eaten with (and often dipped in) your hot drink. A large spiced bun with coconut icing, called a <strong>sibun</strong> (lit. <em>Pale Bun</em>) is a native favourite.</p>
<p>Vekllei people love food. In a way, it has satisfied the vacuum of moneyless society. It is bargained for help, traded for goods, and gifted for favour. It is also one of the largest compromises of Vekllei‚Äôs way of doing things. Upen has a very clear materials hierarchy ‚Äî things made by you, from things around you, which you understand and respect are best. Below that, there are high quality local things made by others. At the very bottom are synthetic, man-made, factory-produced materials churned out to meet demand. Food in Vekllei undeniably exists in this last category for the vast majority of city-dwelling people.</p>
<p>You can reclaim the spiritual purity of foods somewhat by simply loving the ingredients you obtain ‚Äî the black pudding might be grown in vats, but why not transform it by crumbling it over a salad with a nice vinaigrette you‚Äôve made yourself? To alleviate some of this metaphysical tension, most Vekllei neighbourhoods are filled with greenhouses and local shared gardens, which ensures most meals have some produce in which you have participated. That‚Äôs very important. Some people think that, because Vekllei has abolished money, it has abolished the fetishism of products. The opposite is true ‚Äî Vekllei life is about the love and respect of materials, a feature built into the animism of Upen. You cannot buy the best food in Vekllei ‚Äî you have to find it, in a trial of ownership.</p>
<p>Sitting down and enjoying food is a cornerstone of life in Vekllei. You cannot participate in society without it. For immigrants, the privacy of a quiet breakfast is good practice for the palettes and conventions of eating in Vekllei ‚Äî so load up your plates.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/shrine-minded.jpg"/> <p><strong>Shattered fjords make up the north of Vekllei</strong>, particularly in boroughs like <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/santes/">Santes</a> (lit. <em>Saint</em>) which are well-regarded for their striking cliffs and sloping igneous fingers, which evidence Vekllei‚Äôs ongoing volcanism. Offshore, hundreds of islets rise and sink over the centuries.</p>
<p>This is the tiny village of Cult, which sits on the sparse tip of the Grimsy Fjord. It has a local train, but is otherwise only serviced by the Santes regional express ‚Äî a mere single step up on Vekllei‚Äôs train hierarchy. This makes it relatively isolated by Vekllei‚Äôs rail-dense metrics. Cult‚Äôs shorefront is flanked by rocky cliffs that shelter its beaches, which means most of the town is squeezed further in and higher up. By the station at sea level, only a cafe and a handful of factories greet alighting passengers.</p>
<p>In her final year of secondary school, Tzipora had developed a fascination with Upen‚Äôs ‚Äúnatural shrines,‚Äù which contributed to her rapidly developing brand of Judeo-Catholic Upen mysticism. Sometimes after school, when all Cobian wanted was a snack and a movie, Tzipora would drag her onto a bullet train and seek out new shrines ‚Äî unique natural features ‚Äî described in Upen‚Äôs sagas. They would change trains ‚Äî again, then again ‚Äî and finally they‚Äôd arrive in some backwater Tzipora had read about. Then they‚Äôd go looking.</p>
<p>Cobian keenly remembered watching two days‚Äô worth of essay fly out of Tzipora‚Äôs arms and scatter towards the beach in Cult, and thinking that it served her right, just a little bit. It seemed to Cobian that the winds were telling Tzipora to pack up and go home.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Vekllei National Rail (VNR)</strong> has a straightforward scheme for the names of its trains. Each is given a regional name ‚Äî usually a flower or moss, the most important plants in Upen ‚Äî and then the year is appended. This here is a Lesvesn 59-Series, since it entered production with Arisdeh Coachworks in 2059. Its bright orange livery (VNR Orange, specifically) means it‚Äôs a regional train ‚Äî local trains have unique colours voted on by their passengers. The Lesvesn 59-Series is a DC electric multiple unit train type used all over Vekllei, most commonly on quiet semi-express routes, since the trains most often appear in two-car or even single unit configurations. Its bigger cousin, the Mustard 56-Series, is often seen in the cities. It looks more or less the same, but is a little wider.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/diplomacy.jpg"/> <p><strong>Cobian first met Tzipora at Caf√© Maz</strong>, though before then she knew her as ‚ÄòTzipora, the New Girl,‚Äô or, less favourably, ‚ÄòTzipora the Gypsy,‚Äô since there was some confusion about where she‚Äôd come from. The neighbourhood had known about her for a while, since people like to talk about foreigners, and when she was spotted at the Caf√© people talked about that too. Meeting her, Cobian understood why she had become a fascination. She had keen blue eyes that were very gentle, and quite slow-moving. She would look at you, then casually to the wall, then to her shoes, then back to you. The peacefulness in her face contrasted dramatically with the intensity of her movements, which were frenetic and unconscious. She had a tic where she would pull on her nose and shirt, which combined with her novice <a href="https://millmint.net/factbook/society/culture/language/#5-potenne">Potenne</a>, had her hands moving almost constantly as she talked. She was aware of this, because she would notice it periodically and grab her free hand, all without breaking eye contact or the cadence of her conversation. She was very funny; Cobian immediately liked her.</p>
<p>Cobian was a soft-willed sort of person, unopinionated and eager to be liked. Every fact filtered down to a reasonable compromise ‚Äî there was a little bit of good in everything. Some people call that way of thinking gentle. Maybe she was just a little incurious.</p>
<p>Tzipora was her opposite. She lived in a binary world of Tzipora metrics. Things were either pure and beautiful, disgusting and reprehensible, or not worth thinking about. All things passed through this process ‚Äî cars, food, clothes, the shape of a curve, and the form of a kettle. Some people call that way of thinking judgemental. She was.</p>
<p>This fierce intuition applied to people too, and Tzipora had a good memory. She wasn‚Äôt afraid to confront someone if they upset her, which earned her a slap now and then from some girl too rude to take shit from.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou can hit me, slap me like that,‚Äù Tzipora would say, sneering and rearing back on her heels. ‚ÄúFor you to raise your hand against me, like you would a dog ‚Äî I‚Äôll show you, bitch.‚Äù</p>
<p>She would stop by Cobian‚Äôs house, sometimes holding her collar together where a button used to be or nursing an elbow, and they‚Äôd sit out back where her mother couldn‚Äôt see them. Cobian would fold up a towelette and wipe the gravel out of her palms and knees.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where you get off, acting like a gangster,‚Äù Cobian says, dabbing her face. ‚ÄúIt upsets me.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, but she deserved it. You know that. Calls me a <em>pisca</em>; it makes me so angry. Not that she said it to me, but that she thinks she can say such a thing in the first place, like I‚Äôd just pretend I hadn‚Äôt heard it.‚Äù</p>
<p>Tzipora wrestled with the things she said and did constantly. In fact, the ongoing judgement of herself was perhaps the most nuanced opinion Tzipora ever had, one that didn‚Äôt fit into the pure/despicable binary. Most days, she landed on self-disgust, and yet‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Tzipora pulled on her nose and sniffed, like she did whenever she was nervous, and looked at Cobian.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like me blowing up, I‚Äôll try and stop it for you.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to stop for me, I want you to stop for yourself. I‚Äôm just glad you‚Äôre okay,‚Äù Cobian said, and took her hand.</p>

She wakes at five and spends the mornings by herself, reading the paper or a paperback. Baron works late ‚Äî he wakes late. They have breakfast together, so until then she drinks coffee out of a packet and starts the fire if it‚Äôs cold. You were supposed to save power, but sometimes she ran her electric blanket all night, which kept her snug until the under-floor heating warmed up. Her concrete apartment had concrete comforts.</p>
<p>She has a record player that runs compact diskettes filled with free jazz and rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll. What Baron calls ‚Äúbongo music‚Äù. She reads shit thrillers with the sound of the lashing rain and wild drums in foreign signatures.</p>
<p>Above her bed is a cross, which she treats like a totem. She has a very transactional relationship with God. She doesn‚Äôt like him much, but figures doing Him a favour by hanging his cross this one time might earn her a bit of luck when she needs it.</p>
<p>The coffee is hot, and spoiled with milk and sugar. Everybody tells her that‚Äôs no good, that she‚Äôs ruined the coffee. She doesn‚Äôt care, she likes how it tastes. The rain goes on. She thinks about breakfast.</p>

<p><em>A woman has so many parts to her body, life is very hard indeed.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>‚Äî <strong>Lu Xun</strong>, 1927</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Even from my point of view, as a woman, there is nothing attractive about such &lsquo;backward elements.&rsquo; Their skin is beginning to wrinkle, their hair is growing thin, and fatigue is robbing them of their last traces of attractiveness.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>‚Äî <strong>Ding Ling</strong> on the long-marcher woman soldiers, 1942</p>
<p><strong>When Tzipora first arrived in Vekllei in 2063</strong>, she was traumatised by the foreignness of everything. It was not just that they drove on the wrong side of the road, or that the chocolate was made by someone else, but that her whole understanding of the world ‚Äî the world she‚Äôd been raised in all her life ‚Äî was unravelled within weeks. It did not matter if you learned the language, or dressed like them, or worked with them ‚Äî the way a Vekllei person thinks seemed totally alien, as though they were tuned into a frequency that she couldn‚Äôt hear. That was very difficult for her.</p>
<p>Her clearest memory, out of all the emotional turmoil in her first few weeks, was the clothes. Tzipora was not fashionable or materialistic, but she‚Äôd never had nice things to wear. In Vekllei the things on the rack were simple, and often second-hand, but they were very well made and the department stores had a big variety. She picked out five shirts, nearly identical, and decided that these would be what she would wear from now on ‚Äî it was her own way of establishing an identity; SHE IS THE GIRL WHO WEARS THIS TYPE OF SHIRT. Little things like that mattered a lot, because Tzipora was treated differently here. She was both ‚Äòyoung‚Äô and a ‚Äògirl‚Äô, which had implications for how overseas people talked to her and how she was regarded. Here, almost no one seemed to notice. She had dignity by default, which was exciting and scary at the same time, so she needed something other than her appearance to claim as ‚Äòhers‚Äô. And at that time, it was the shirt with the pleats.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Vekllei is a place that is very much radical</strong> but, either intentionally or as a byproduct of its opaque culture, suppresses the <em>appearance</em> of radicalism in its public affairs (or as they say there, ‚Äòsun-facing space‚Äô). This is for a few reasons. First, Vekllei uses its obscurity as a weapon against its continental neighbours, who might pull it into geopolitical tensions it wants no part of. The second is that Vekllei‚Äôs failed revolutionary movements of the early 20th Century are buried with the Junta that suppressed them. The third, and most critically, is that Vekllei people themselves are unaware of just how saturated their lives are with the cultural and political ideology of the floral period, which makes ‚Äúforeign‚Äù political thinking difficult and results in a lot of empty rhetoric ‚Äî for example, ‚Äúpetticoat socialism‚Äù describes the Bureau System, which does not have much to do with either petticoats or continental socialism.</p>
<p>This paradigm makes more sense when you consider that there are really two Veklleis ‚Äî the one that existed before the Atomic War, and the one that exists now, called the ‚ÄúFloral Period‚Äù or sometimes ‚ÄúPetticoat Society‚Äù. The one that existed before has little resemblance to the one that exists now, and that is the way people have continued to think in the decades of independence ‚Äî anything prior to 2015 is, simply, history.</p>
<p>Make no mistake ‚Äî Vekllei is tremendously radical in its culture and politics, which it tempers with conservative names and third-way politicking. Today‚Äôs post looks at how the Vekllei woman changed in the years between 2005 and 2020.</p>
<p>Not unlike revolutions of years past, postwar Vekllei had (for the moment, at least) lost many of its structural oppressors of women, since the structure itself had collapsed quickly. The interim government had taken an orthodox, though contrarian, communist position, which ushered a new handbook of rhetoric towards de-objectification of women and their pragmatic and social value in the workforce. The interim government had several key women figures among it, who are credited with its success in this critical, and rapidly changing period.</p>
<p>In the Vekllei socialist (<em>socialisme oa Vekllei</em>) line of thinking, there are two points of attack. There was the suppression of old models of feminine beauty, which argued against women‚Äôs independence and dignity in favour of their security with men, who made up Vekllei‚Äôs economic and social caste throughout the entirety of the Junta‚Äôs rule. But there was also a very real fear that women‚Äôs liberation by Western metrics would simply evolve indentured living into a more obtuse, and in some ways more sinister, commodity-woman (<em>cosmavisiousnesh</em>, lit. ‚Äòplastic woman‚Äô<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>), who was free to educate herself but found her appearance subjected to permanent scrutiny ‚Äî a product for a consumer, dependent on shifting fashions and complex social constellations still fundamentally controlled by men. This fear was not unfounded, as many educated women of the interim government (who made up nearly half of its members) had spent significant time in Western Europe and the United States, and were keenly aware of who was ‚Äúgazing‚Äù (<em>lismious</em>) and who was being ‚Äúgazed at‚Äù (<em>visimett</em>).</p>
<p>The solution developed by the interim government was both political and spiritual, designed to demolish the external remnants of Vekllei‚Äôs pre-war and highly stratified society, and the looming threats of foreign investment, new wealth, and an import of the modern commodity-woman. Most importantly, it understood that present notions of empowerment or disempowerment were problematic unto themselves ‚Äî whether it was sexual liberation, modesty, or indeed the economic role of women in abstract ‚Äî their ability to empower was still fundamentally chained to old society, which was still dominated by the sexist cultural default.</p>
<p>In 2016, Cisma de Diviousmesn, First Secretary of the War Recovery Committee, described the problem as such in The <em>Atlantic</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are nearing a precipice that all Vekllei women may fall into, should we follow unblinkingly the Visis Plan [postwar redevelopment plan], and allow foreign investment to replace English colonial governor-generals; we should be wise enough, so to speak, to not trade a king for a master and call it recovery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <em>Upen</em>‚Äôs discourse on womanhood, the essential virtues of a woman have always included good words, good work and good fortune ‚Äî emphasising the role of women as both an alias for success/wealth and also as responsible for that fortune themselves, either in the workplace or through their innate spirituality. This has remained true throughout much of Vekllei‚Äôs history, but was obfuscated by the economic masculinity of Vekllei‚Äôs protectionist mercantile period. After the war, Upen saw a revival that would culminate in the spiritual fever of the late 2010s and early 2020s. The interim government co-opted this surge pragmatically, encouraging a shift in local perceptions of womanhood through spiritual, rather than political or ideological, methods.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is a New Age,‚Äù the posters said. ‚ÄúSo become a New-Age Woman.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Becoming a New Age Woman involved two things ‚Äî tearing down the external oppressions of the old and interim periods (harassment, domestic violence, and male interference in the affairs of women), and the interrogation of internalised sexisms (empowerment by male opinion [this included styles women found attractive, as inherited from men], abolishment of economic preoccupations, and the reconstruction of womanhood in abstract). This individual struggle was supported by the many social programmes developed by the interim government, with names like ‚Äúeconomic feminisation‚Äù (abolishment of the male economic burden) and ‚Äúabolishment of self-beautification for your man‚Äù (<em>scisimionze</em>, or ‚Äúself-adornment/self-beautification‚Äù).</p>
<p>The point was not to empower women by simply displacing men from male economic and social constructions ‚Äî a move that was seen as disempowering because of who was setting those priorities ‚Äî  but to rebuild Vekllei‚Äôs domestic understanding of ‚Äúthe woman‚Äù by the terms of women, legitimised by the authority of the interim government and the powerful cultural force Upen continues to have on society. Within such a culture, it was reasoned, women would be free to choose what womanhood meant to them, since it was not simply reactive to a sexist cultural default. The sum of this effort was called ‚Äòsun-facing,‚Äô or <em>semoisnesne</em>, which referred to the progressive attitude of both the individual and the country.</p>
<p>Although Vekllei‚Äôs New Age Woman had dramatic effects and benefitted the status of women in Vekllei society tremendously, it was nonetheless fundamentally political and had obscure and surprising cultural artefacts buried within. The idea that a woman would be ‚Äúfree to choose‚Äù her own womanhood was a little misleading, since the interim government was rapidly developing its plan for ‚Äúpetticoat society,‚Äù in which Sundress Municipalism, the Bureau System and Floral Aestheticism would become such powerful cultural forces that no man nor woman would be able to escape them entirely.</p>
<p>As the wealth of the country grew and then exploded in the transition to Vekllei‚Äôs floral society, it was clear how the structure of petticoat society continued to influence women in Vekllei. Women can wear whatever they like ‚Äî but simplicity and subtle self-decoration are common and encouraged by the uniforms system and floral aesthetics. Women can live however they like ‚Äî but education is compulsory in childhood and highly valued, and young women are encouraged to fulfil ‚Äòthe female inclination for leadership‚Äô inherited from Upen‚Äôs mother-metaphysics. And women can date whomever they like ‚Äî though ideological compatibility, and not appearance, is encouraged in the <em>semoisnesne</em> attitude.</p>
<p>Some of these things are easily argued as good ‚Äî few would assume there are many feminists in the world who argue against the education of women ‚Äî but they do betray the notion of truly ‚Äúfree‚Äù choice, insofar as Vekllei society is dominated by the economic and spiritual values of its structure. Vekllei considers capitalist economics, exponential growth, and gross historicism to be ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù ‚Äî of course that sort of language trickles down into the social aspects of society. More directly, it prioritises form, colour, and purity in aesthetics ‚Äî of course that aesthetic ideology affects how people dress, and contributes to its uniformed culture.</p>
<p>It is difficult to place where the state begins and ends in Vekllei, which is how it can be argued for as an unfree and anarchic society simultaneously. So too is it difficult to determine how much of Vekllei culture originates in the centres of power in Vekllei ‚Äî either political or religious ‚Äî and subsequently there are problems in clarifying how women are affected by power, especially since women participate and in some cases dominate those hierarchies. Are they externalised, or internalised? Who is gazing at who?</p>
<p>Regardless of Vekllei‚Äôs cultural obscurity, which affects much more than politics and many people other than women, it is clear a dramatic and liberating shift occurred in Vekllei‚Äôs interim period of independence, and that shift has contributed tremendously to the status of contemporary Vekllei women, who enjoy economic and social freedoms that were unimaginable just decades prior. Even though Vekllei has not embraced political iconography to celebrate their indigenous feminism, we can see just how radical and wide-ranging the changes made were.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/rivers.jpg"/> <p><strong>Out in Voya Voya</strong>, the gardens light the people, and distill human temperament into momentary, sequential lyrical images. A dead leaf moving by miracle across still water; an overturned bucket collecting dew along its handle; fern leaves half-curled, young and growing. Vekllei is known as a ‚Äúgarden city,‚Äù and Voya Voya has the best of them. Vekllei urban planning is wandering and wasteful, and in this borough the city centre is checkered by wild parks filled with silence and rainforest smells.</p>
<p>Cobian and Tzipora were dating, or something adjacent to it. It was an unusual thing they had going on, since they weren‚Äôt much like each other. They‚Äôd arranged to have a picnic on Sunday, but a few days out the newspaper said it would rain. Rain-dates meant a movie and lunch.</p>
<p>Then the forecast got worse. It wasn‚Äôt just a shower‚Äî it was big rain, with high winds. A storm, anyone but Tzipora would say.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe should cancel,‚Äù Cobian said on the phone.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the big deal? The movie‚Äôs indoors, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù ‚Äî that was Tzipora, who was very eager to go out with her.</p>
<p>On Sunday, they met at the Couisvisia Hills Station, the one closest to Cobian‚Äôs house. They took the train to Lola and talked as rain began to make streams down the windows.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis looks bad,‚Äù Cobian said, not touching the window because she was afraid of germs. ‚ÄúLook at the clouds in the distance, too ‚Äî It‚Äôs gonna pour; I don‚Äôt want to get all wet.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI brought an umbrella,‚Äù said Tzipora, whose responsibilities now included managing the weather.</p>
<p>By some miracle, they reached the cinema before the first storm clouds rolled in. They listened to it whistle beneath the sounds of the film. Occasionally the rain would wash over the roof loud enough to hear it. Every time the storm made a noise Cobian sighed quietly, and Tzipora looked at her anxiously, wringing her hands like she did when she was nervous.</p>
<p>After the film, they stepped into the lobby to find the rain had ceased. In fact, it had vanished ‚Äî the gutters were running like hell, and every corner of every roof dripped. But the rain had stopped.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLook,‚Äù Tzipora said, stepping over a puddle onto the footpath and presenting the sky to Cobian. ‚ÄúI am a rain goddess.‚Äù</p>
<p>They made a run to the station through the park as the wind scattered water through the air. Tzipora took about five steps into the park before splashing a puddle up herself and soaking her foot.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor God‚Äôs sake, let‚Äôs keep going,‚Äù she growled.</p>
<p>Another two steps and she did it again, with the other foot. In fact, the whole park was sodden, and the gutters had been overwhelmed. The picnic field had turned into a lake. Trees had wilted under the weight of raindrops. The sound of running water was everywhere. Tzipora had given up and began navigating Cobian by the hand like a conscript charging through a minefield.</p>
<p>Cobian followed, holding the umbrella open uselessly as the wind chilled the water on their skin. They came across a concrete staircase, now a waterfall, as the park-lake drained into the street below. Tzipora, emboldened with the strength of the sacrificial, stepped into it and helped Cobian jump across without sliding into the mud on the other side.</p>
<p>As she did, with water filling her shoes and her skirt dripping footpath water, she thought about how much fun this was. You didn‚Äôt go on adventures much at their age. She looked at Cobian, who was shivering in the wind and waiting for her, and thought she probably didn‚Äôt feel the same way.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou all right?‚Äù Tzipora asked, stepping out and shaking water off her shoes.</p>
<p>Cobian gave a thumbs up as she shivered, and all was right in the world.</p>

<p><strong>In <a href="utopia/landscape/boroughs/eyri">Eyri</a>, the bones of an ancient beast warp and groan in the sun</strong>, red skin glinting in the whitecap churn of the shallows, oxidising, broken, ripped open by the sea. Everyone in the North of Vekllei knows about it. Mysteries abound. Even in our atomic century, the humans of Vekllei are enamoured with and terrified by the ocean.</p>
<p>In the Winter of 2018, just three years into Vekllei‚Äôs shaky, indigent independence, the TransNorth Oil Company purchased a submarine icebreaker called <em>Sea Serpent</em> from U.S. Oil. It was a crock of shit, built in the late ‚Äò80s to move crude through the Arctic in the difficult seasons. Submarine icebreakers were among the ugliest boats ever made, with thin necks that cut through ice and a warty conn crown.</p>
<p>It was not unusual for no-name oil companies to buy up old shipping stock, but TransNorth was something else. If you tracked its company address, you came to a dilapidated warehouse in Memphis with signage affixed ‚Äî totally deserted. It appears, following the paperwork, no one at all had purchased the <em>Sea Serpent</em>.</p>
<p>Two months after its sale, an unregistered vessel by chance triggered a decades-old Soviet detection buoy near Vekllei‚Äôs EEZ. The Common Interest Watchhawk programme, designed to demilitarise the Arctic after the Atomic War, allowed the Soviets to report the event to Vekllei and the U.K. ‚Äî perhaps suspicious it was a clandestine U.S. nuclear sub.</p>
<p>Somewhere in a command room of Vekllei‚Äôs fledgeling secret service (back then called the Office of National Intelligence, the predecessor to HO/NI), a siren fired off. Sixty minutes later, a military helijet touched down in Basa, a northern military office. A destroyer left port in Montre.</p>
<p>The buoy was working correctly, and the quiet hum of commercial submarine tech was tracked for eight hours, all the way to Vekllei‚Äôs territorial waters. There, the mystery vessel was radioed, radioed again, and destroyed. There was no tolerance for smugglers or spooks in postwar Vekllei.</p>
<p>Thirty minutes after depth charges boomed in the North Sea, the <em>Sea Serpent</em> ran aground on an isolated beach in Eyri. It pushed itself right into the shallows, slashing its coolant pipes on the rocks as it capsized into the beach. With ionised radiation glowing faintly in the water, naval commandos stormed the conning tower, now on its side. Radio equipment, maps, chairs ‚Äî it had all been flung across the dim interior in its capsizing. Inside were eight men in plain clothes, all dead. All were shot ‚Äî one self-inflicted.</p>
<p>It was not until fifty years later, during the Dallas Crisis and the secession of the Dallas States, that some sort of clue as to the lair of the <em>Sea Serpent</em> emerged. As negotiations dragged on for the Dallas lend-lease of U.S. government properties and infrastructure, a building owned by the Chroma Industrial Concern, a Floridian company subsidised by Washington, was included in a trade of some 614 assets leaked to AB/NI. A young AB/NI asset named Baron Desmoisnes, part of the team filing the leaks, followed up and found Chroma had a warehouse in Memphis.</p>
<p>It appears the <em>Sea Serpent</em> was coming for Vekllei ‚Äî who says snakes don‚Äôt commit suicide?</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/justice.jpg"/> <p><strong>Lin Zhi was nuts</strong>. She was lovely, but she was nuts. Tzipora followed along, pleading occasionally, a squeaking voice of concern. The cricket bat dragged and bounced along the poor road sealing.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou could go to prison,‚Äù Tzipora said, protesting weakly. ‚ÄúWhy not send Moise and his boys? They‚Äôll put the fear of God in him.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is stupid,‚Äù Zhi said in clumsy Vekllei, staring ahead. ‚ÄúYou do not know what it‚Äôs like.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI do know,‚Äù Tzipora whined. Between their second-hand Vekllei and conflicting accents, they struggled to understand each other. ‚ÄúThey call me a gypsy bitch. But I don‚Äôt hit them. And not with a bat.‚Äù</p>
<p>Zhi and Zelda were much alike. They were both fresh immigrants of school age, and stepped ashore with shadows of a world far beyond Vekllei‚Äôs utopian domesticity. Tzipora had spent time indigent in America, nearly lynched in Utah. Zhi had lost her father and uncle to the purges in Red China. Zhi told Tzipora she was the great-great-granddaughter of a hero of the communist party, who‚Äôd fought with Mao Tse-tung himself over a century ago. Tzipora did not enquire further, since she knew as much about China as she did the moon.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo one is asking you to come,‚Äù Zhi said, marching ahead as Tzipora trailed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be silly, I‚Äôm coming with you. Of course I‚Äôm coming with you. I just don‚Äôt want you to ruin your life over some words.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWords add up,‚Äù Zhi said quietly.</p>
<p>The rest of Zhi‚Äôs seven sisters had taken European names to better assimilate into the hectic transcontinental <em>aliyah</em> of postwar Vekllei. Not Zhi, though. She was wilful and clear-minded, maybe recklessly. Tzipora liked her and feared her, perhaps because she saw herself in Zhi‚Äôs frequent outbursts of anger and principled view of the world.</p>
<p>The Floral Period was stuffed with new citizens, many of them in disfavour of the politics of their home country. Many of them came from Asia ‚Äî <a href="https://millmint.net/posts/2020-06-12-ayn/">Ayn‚Äôs</a> father was a Hong Konger, and <a href="https://millmint.net/posts/2020-04-20-spectre/">Jiro</a> was from Tokyo. Vekllei‚Äôs people were indigenously ‚ÄúAsiatic in appearance,‚Äù as Europe called them. Most were descended from a mixture of Arctic peoples and Irish or Scandinavian settlers. To this end, Vekllei‚Äôs complicated ethnic makeup contributes to the country‚Äôs obscurity from the U.S. and Europe, as they tend to be orientalised outside of Western concern. This discrimination does not stop Vekllei people from maintaining ignorant ideas towards its incoming East Asian and South-East Asian migrants, however, and people like Zhi often had to deal with racist abuse in public and in private.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we be smart about this?‚Äù Tzipora asked, upset. ‚ÄúWhat he did to you is against school policy. He‚Äôll be thrown out ‚Äî it‚Äôll ruin him. That‚Äôs what hurts, really. Trust me, I know. I know what it‚Äôs like for you, too. But he wants to go to the National University. If we get him thrown out, that would ruin him.‚Äù</p>
<p>Zhi scoffed, and shook her head. ‚ÄúThat you could think the school would do anything shows how little you know,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBaron is powerful. He can lean on them. He does it all the time, he‚Äôd help if I asked. I know he would.‚Äù</p>
<p>Tzipora stepped in front of her, and put her arms out. Her eyes were shining with tears.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI was going to get expelled for putting a girl‚Äôs head through a window, and it was like this,‚Äù Tzipora said, sniffling. ‚ÄúShe picked on me every day. Every day, she knew I was lonely and sad so she‚Äôd scare me. And one day I snapped and put her head through the window. I was going to be expelled, and my life would have ended there. But Baron knew I was right, and he stepped in. Sometimes that‚Äôs all it takes, to beat them. It just takes an outsider.‚Äù</p>
<p>Zhi had stopped marching, and leaned on the bat. She was out of breath. She shook her head and tossed the bat at Tzipora‚Äôs feet.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBecause I like you, Zelda, that‚Äôs all. Don‚Äôt tell him anything. Don‚Äôt tell anyone anything. This is my problem. But I don‚Äôt want to upset you. We‚Äôre quite similar, I think.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúToo similar,‚Äù Tzipora said, wiping her eyes. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not our fault. Not really.‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Caught amidst sunrays in early Autumn, things are good</strong>. You could call almost anyone on the telephone these days. And if you wanted to see someone, why travel? A videophone was just as good. But just as the photograph failed to displace the painter, neither did the telephone or videophone succeed in killing the hand-written letter. There was something thoughtful about it. It was intimate, but also dependent on memory. Memories of people, memories of places. It was slower, yes, but that&rsquo;s just how life worked in this country. It is a good way to live.</p>

<p><strong>We‚Äôre going to do a deep dive on stamps today.</strong></p>
<p>You can tell a domestic Vekllei stamp from its international counterpart quite easily:</p>
<ol>
<li>Domestic stamps have a coloured square, called a <em>chromacode,</em> used for sorting mail automatically within the country by a special machine called a <em>kinosemimatia</em>.</li>
<li>Domestic stamps do not show a price in <a href="https://millmint.net/factbook/vekllei/#5-economy">Vekllei Kroner</a>, and generally do not use the Vekllei hieroglyph to announce its origin.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can deduce that the stamps pictured above are all <em>domestic</em> stamps used for sending mail to other Vekllei people, regardless of whether they live in Antarctica, Vekllei‚Äôs lunar colonies or anywhere in-between.</p>
<p>Stamps are valuable records of their time, particularly as memories of celebration. You can learn a lot about a place and what it values by looking at its stamps.</p>
<p><strong>Let‚Äôs take a look at some of Vekllei‚Äôs domestic postage stamps from the last few years. From the top left:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>2063 marked the launch of the third generation of Vekllei rocket booster since independence in 2015. The introduction of these boosters, spaced evenly across the postwar decades, marked eras in themselves for Vekllei‚Äôs extraterrestrial ambitions. By the 2060s, most metals were mined off-world, marking one of the greatest weapons for peace in the atomic era ‚Äî vast new worlds of untapped resources. This particular postage stamp was released as part of a set celebrating Vekllei rocketry, including recent expeditions to planetoids on the very periphery of our solar system.</li>
<li>Puffins are the national bird and appear everywhere. You can see why ‚Äî they‚Äôre pretty birds and very common in Vekllei. They are popularly circulated on stamps in a variety of styles simply because people like to see them when sending and receiving mail.</li>
<li>This stamp may look abstract at first, but is actually a message in <a href="https://millmint.net/factbook/society/culture/language/#7-vekllei-semaphore">Vekllei Semaphore</a>. Green and gold represent nature and living blood, which alternated like this usually refers to natural chaos. But there‚Äôs more to it ‚Äî this striping pattern, called a sunburst in Vekllei hieroglyphs, refers to the sun, and can mean warmth. These swooping white lines mean purity, or delicateness, and those patterned squares are used for the borders of announcements from the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office. So can you guess what this stamps says? It‚Äôs announcing Vekllei‚Äôs success in the Olympics in skiing, of course. Vekllei Semaphore is rarely straightforward ‚Äî it has a thousand quirks built over a thousand years.</li>
<li>Speaking of the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office, this is Ms. Prime Minister Jo Sismiosnah, one of two Prime Ministers in the country.</li>
<li>Atomic weaponry is a fact of life in the 2060s, and Vekllei has a complex psychological relationship with nukes as both a victim and retainer of nuclear weapons. It is also the only country in the world to have detonated nuclear weapons for a <a href="https://millmint.net/posts/2020-06-01-fission/">cultural purpose</a>. This stamp depicts such a detonation. In the absurdity of the Royal Mail Press, antinuclear stamps are also produced simultaneously, depicting white doves urging world leaders to denuclearise.</li>
<li>This flower, called a Lava Rose, is common to the <a href="https://millmint.net/images/railmap.jpg">Lumiousniyah</a> region on the West of the country. Not by coincidence, its chromacode is destined for Copette.</li>
<li>Vekllei retains a great many nuclear icebreakers to keep shipping traffic moving in and out of its Northern regions. The country depends heavily on foreign shipping for its bizarre peripheral markets and such icebreakers are often celebrated on stamps.</li>
<li>This is Vekllei‚Äôs lovely agricultural belt throughout its rich volcanic interior, specifically based off Kyala‚Äôs wheat fields. By no coincidence, its chromacode is destined for Kyala.</li>
<li>Finally, we see a celebration of Anglo-Vekllei relations in the post-occupation period. Although historical tensions will linger for many generations more, and disputes over fishing rights in the Atlantic continue to threaten friendly relations, Vekllei is very keen in a political context to celebrate the diplomatic successes achieved with the U.K. since occupation, and you‚Äôll find the U.K. generally overrepresented on Vekllei‚Äôs ‚Äòforeign‚Äô domestic stamps.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Now that‚Äôs a lot of stamp facts!</strong> Before we go, Tzipora has just a couple of words on starting your own stamp collection:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NEVER PEEL STAMPS</strong>. Cut them off the envelope and soak it in water for an hour or so, until it separates freely.</li>
<li>Dry your stamps on a tea towel. Press them with books so they don‚Äôt curl.</li>
<li>Keep your stamps safe by keeping them in an album, preferably.</li>
<li>Share your stamps. Stamps are meant to be shared, so never be afraid to trade your boring Vekllei stamps to some friendly Soviet or American for theirs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>That‚Äôs all for now</strong>. We‚Äôve got one more post left in ‚ÄúMail Week‚Äù (more like Mail Month at this rate), before we head off to something new. It‚Äôs going to be very exciting!</p>

<p><em>It was the hottest day of June so far, in that time of year where the sun never set on Vekllei. It was the first week of sleepless nights; the windows thrown open, air sticky and pungent with the smells of the rainforests, tossing and turning in the heat.</em></p>
<p><em>A stab of panic shot through her as she woke, bleary-eyed and senseless, to the quiet bedside clock. She blinked a couple of times before the terror set in. She‚Äôd overslept ‚Äî 08:32 ‚Äî but critically, the Travelling Post Office left at 8:30. Shit, shit shit.</em></p>
<p><em>Maybe, just maybe, she could run to the next station and catch it when it stopped to offload the grocer‚Äôs produce.</em></p>
<p><em>Lying atop damp sheets, she rolled out of bed and made a racket on the wooden floor of her house, wiping her eyes as she looked for her friend‚Äôs package. She flew out the front door moments later in the shorts and tee shirt she‚Äôd slept in, raking a sandal across the gravel as she landed awkwardly. It was usually a fifteen minute walk to the station, so she ran as fast as she could, the package bouncing off her leg painfully as she took off down the drive. Warm raindrops started to hit the dirt around her.</em></p>
<p><em>As she rounded the corner where the dirt track met paved path, she met it ‚Äî the No. 76 Mail Train, closing in from behind. The mist had rolled in and the hot rain was belting down. No. 76 was going to overtake her ‚Äî but she still might catch it before it departed. This was going to be close.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Mail Trains</strong></em>, or <strong>Rail Post Offices</strong>, are a common sight in Vekllei once you leave the dense urban infrastructure of its coastal cities behind. The further you venture into Vekllei‚Äôs dramatic, tendril-like mountain ranges and igneous valleys, the smaller towns become. Some, like Montre-Lola, had their post offices closed long ago, and today are served by a series of travelling post offices that run along the ubiquitous web of commuter rail lines in the country. The advantages are obvious; one train, running along a single line, can service six or seven towns in a morning.</p>
<p>They pull into a siding, usually the platform of the local station in quiet towns, and wait for fifteen minutes or so to allow for the loading and unloading of mail. They can also perform duties of regular post offices, like the renewal of identification and travel booking, as long as you phone ahead.</p>
<p>Modern Mail Trains are typically based on the Series 225 EMU in 2-car configurations. These are modern locomotives with electric motors in each car, allowing the 225 (known as the <em>RM Series</em> in its Mail Train configuration) to easily run along Vekllei‚Äôs old interior rail lines, which have steep gradients and tight curves. The exception is the Siviouscopet de Desmisnion, or <em>Ambassador of the Postmistress</em>, a special mail-sorting train based on the 6-car Series 4000 trainset that operates between the Capital and Montre. The <em>Ambassador</em> is particularly special, since it houses a fully furnished office available to the Postmistress General for her use in running the Royal Vekllei Mail.</p>
<p>Tzipora here has encountered the simple adventures of rural living; navigating the friendly bureaucracy of her government from small towns long since forgotten in common memory.</p>

<p><strong>There are not many postal services older than the Royal Vekllei Mail</strong>. It is so old that in the Vekllei language its title is simply ‚ÄòMail‚Äô ‚Äî the ‚ÄòRoyal‚Äô and ‚ÄòVekllei‚Äô are implied by the use of its hieroglyph. Founded in 1422 as part of the military communications system between government and mercantile government holdings, it has survived various restructurings ‚Äî and several wars ‚Äî to remain a critical communications and cultural institution today.</p>
<p>As is the usual way with State Requisites (A.r.), the (Royal Vekllei) Mail maintains a state monopoly on all paper and electric mail in the country, serviced by a workforce of nearly fifty thousand people and two hundred thousand <a href="https://millmint.net/posts/2021-01-11-automen/">automen</a>. Peculiarly, telephones, telegrams and videophones are structured under the Mail as the Mail Bureau Office of Telecommunications, which acts as an independent organ of the Mail A.r.</p>
<p>Vekllei people send nearly 12 million letters a day ‚Äî that‚Äôs about one for every two people, and the Mail processes and delivers another 40 million mail pieces a day. It does this with a fleet of jets, automatic trucks, dedicated mail trains, intercity pneumatic systems, vehicle automen, and postmen, all wearing the red and gold colours of the organisation. It previously served the King of Vekllei, during the years of monarchy, and today serves the Royal (Land) Sovereign ‚Äî the confusing name for the landscape of Vekllei and its potential for human use. It is <em>de facto</em> bound by the <a href="https://millmint.net/factbook/vekllei/#floral-society">Petticoat constitution of the Floral Period.</a></p>
<p>Vekllei people love their Mail, as a patriotic analogy for the unity of the city-state. Red postboxes are visible on every street in city boroughs, and in the country Post Offices serve as critical contact points for communities isolated from urban business. The announcing of the Mail‚Äôs Postmaster General is a deeply ceremonial affair, second only to the ascension of new Prime Ministers. Vekllei was home to the world‚Äôs first Postmistress General, Mi Miou, in 2016 shortly after independence.</p>
<p>It is only appropriate that the Universal Postal Union, the U.N. body responsible for the worldwide mail treaty coordinating international postage, is headquartered in Vekllei‚Äôs Capital district, two blocks away from the Mail‚Äôs luxurious <a href="https://millmint.net/posts/2019-12-20-apartment/"><em>Newda</em></a> head post office and administration complex. As one of the oldest of Vekllei‚Äôs ancient, evolving state institutions it perhaps best symbolises the age and service of the Vekllei state to its people.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/puffling.jpg"/> <p><strong>She joined the Puffin Scouts to make friends</strong>. Tzipora was not especially rugged or outdoorsy, but she was a fresh patriot, and the idea of collecting awards for conservation, in her mind, was much like Baron collecting medals for killing reds in the War.</p>
<p>The green and gold of the Puffin Scouts represent nature and living blood respectively. Entwined, as here on her scarf, they mean the chaos and inhumanity of nature in <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language#7-vekllei-semaphore">Vekllei Semaphore</a>. Puffin Scout troops are based out of a region with a <a href="/posts/2020-12-05-gods/"><em>Kronaismioudelfia</em></a> (Crown Land), which are abandoned wild areas the Vekllei state has relinquished to the natural spirits worshiped in <a href="/factbook/society/culture/religion/">Upen</a>. Hikes aren‚Äôt done in Crown Lands because if someone gets hurt or goes missing it can be very difficult to get them out.</p>
<p>These wildernesses captured Tzipora‚Äôs imagination, since they are often the site of gods and extranatural features. The animals you saw out there seemed deeply disturbed by the presence of people, as though they were the vessels of spirits, irritated that a human girl had made her way in.</p>
<p>School-aged Puffin Scouts are called Pufflings. In Vekllei, puffin birds are as common as gulls, and nest in cliffs where they raise their young in burrows. Tzipora, despite being a Puffling, never had much luck with puffins. They seemed to exempt her from their natural friendliness and curiosity ‚Äî they flew away whenever she came close, and when they didn‚Äôt fly away they attacked her. She joined the Puffin Scouts to make friends, and yet here she was, cast out from both the Human and Animal Kingdoms.</p>
<p>In this picture, Tzipora watches a puffin in full scout regalia, wary of its intent. The birds make cute novelties for some, but Tzipora knows better. Just like Baron in the war, she sits still and watches closely, listening for movement on the wind. They are locked in a battle of the wits, waiting to see who will make the first move.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/momentsinlove.jpg"/> <p><strong>Lava was a modern walled city.</strong> It had long lost its walls, but its florid green belt disguised a complex network of trenches, tunnels and forts that linked emplacements in the surrounding mountains. Together, these systems would ensure Vekllei would never again have to tolerate occupation by a foreign power. Lava was on the outskirts of Vekllei‚Äôs great capital city, and much of its cityscape was dispersed, affording residents a slower pace of life.</p>
<p>Above Lava‚Äôs commercial heart were its terraced hills, and from up there you could see the canal ferries wind their way through the city. At the edge of a terraced park sits a bench full of memories.</p>
<p>Although Tzipora looked the same as ever, she was 20 now. Cobian was nearly 18, and considering more sincerely her future. She cared about what other people thought of her. To that end they were always worlds apart. Tzipora was driven by a self-sustaining obsessive intuition, not the advice of her peers. Her imitation of ordinary teen-age life was usually misguided and clumsy. She had never made a good teenager ‚Äî a good much of anything, really. But she was a very good Tzipora.</p>
<p>Even now, Tzipora didn‚Äôt really think of herself as a homosexual, in the same way she didn‚Äôt consider herself a girl who wore glasses despite the near-sighted prescription specs she kept in her purse. After all, as she liked to say, there was nothing sexy about her ‚Äî a good Catholic education and a miracle prepubescence saw to that. In the prejudice of the time, that‚Äôs what it meant to be a homosexual, at least to her. So this relationship ‚Äî whatever it was ‚Äî was not really that. She could avoid public judgement and her own ongoing prejudices if she simply pretended like her sincere feelings for Cobian did not amount to homosexuality.</p>
<p>Tzipora was a funny person, capable of great emotional maturity and immaturity depending on her environs. With Baron, she was serious and independent. With Cobian, she was energetic and overeager. Cobian was in no such turmoil about her preference of partner, and unlike Tzipora she was becoming an adult woman capable of exploring a serious, adult relationship. She would grow older and older, and Tzipora would stay there, same as ever. They both knew it was coming. Tzipora was not a child, but she was also not exactly an adult either ‚Äî she was Tzipora, and she would be Tzipora for as long as she lived, much as she was now.</p>
<p>Tzipora didn‚Äôt generally talk about her feelings, but Cobian was very good at it. They travelled to the terraced park from Lola, and found the bench they‚Äôd visited years prior as junior high school students. Back then they‚Äôd seen a film at the State Cinema in town and walked for a while after, just talking about it. They‚Äôd ended up here, as night fell, and talked until the early morning. Maybe it was a date; maybe it was their first date ‚Äî what constituted a date with Tzipora? Their relationship was much the same as it had ever been, just with the knowledge they loved each other. But what a revelation that had been. Tzipora had cried when she told her. Tzipora did not cry about much but gestures of affection always overwhelmed her.</p>
<p>Today they sat on that bench again and talked, and they talked for a long while. What will you study? What will we do? What will Tzipora do for the rest of her life ‚Äî is she destined to drift from person to person, parasitically enjoying their friendship until they aged out of her reach? Where would Cobian live? What would Tzipora like to do for a living? Will they always be friends, and love each other?</p>
<p>Yes, they both agreed, they would always be friends, and they would always love each other.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/robots.jpg"/> <p><strong>The Vekllei word for a robot is</strong> <em><strong>automasiosn</strong></em>, or ‚Äòautoman‚Äô. When we talk about Vekllei being a ‚Äúpost-scarcity society,‚Äù it is by automen through which it happens. They are found across the entire country in all types of hard and boring work, forever dutiful, forever mindless. It is not that the robot has replaced the human worker, since <a href="https://millmint.net/factbook/vekllei/#employment">about 90%</a> of Vekllei people are employed. Instead, the automan takes its place in the necessary evils of industrial society, fulfilling the wildest fantasies of utopian industrialists; the factory is no longer just the place of the machine, it is in fact a machine itself.</p>
<p>When we talk about Vekllei ‚Äúdeindustrialising,‚Äù it is by automen through which it happens. They are neither alive nor entirely synthetic, and work to maintain the basic comforts of consumer society in secret, as the Vekllei state moves towards total deregulation of the human life experience. The more they produce, the further Vekllei people are pushed away from modernity.</p>
<p>Automen better resemble automatic machines than a synthetic person; the vast majority of them are bespoke products integrated into infrastructure for a specific purpose. Some are hidden in plain sight ‚Äî the automatic train control, the system which closes and cleans public lavatories, and telephone switchboards are all operated by automen. They don‚Äôt think like a human does, because they are manufactured, not born.</p>
<p>The activity of the robot brain, called mind-genesis, emerges from artificial substrates of crystal (called command clocks) linked by vat-grown brain tissue, which organically process commands delivered by a computer. Most commands for a robot are sensory, and utilise the brain‚Äôs natural instinct for balance and orientation in processing. Most robot brains in Vekllei are completely engineered, but are based on mapped sections of ape brains and grown in pluripotent stem cell vats in an immersion fluid.</p>
<p>Command clocks are produced in superheated ovens that are then submerged in an ionised liquid. These wafers, called ‚Äúcookies‚Äù, are manufactured out of tetrachalcogenic materials that support ‚Äúcartographic‚Äù (as opposed to ‚Äúchaotic‚Äù) crystal pathways. Early robots used tridymite, which occurs naturally in Vekllei, but almost all robots today use synthetic crystal (usually quartz) grown in hydrothermal crystal plants.</p>
<p>The tissue and command clocks are knitted together in what is basically an incredibly precise and expensive sewing machine, connecting the command clocks to their electrical components and the clocks to the living tissue by way of an axon gun. The result is a device with instincts, dumb and unthinking but highly sensitive and adaptive to inputs. When coupled with other modules, like sensor lasers, automen are able to navigate independently of programmed instruction sets. Since most of their programming and memory are offloaded, they are also relatively inexpensive compared to early overseas models.</p>
<p>Very few automen in Vekllei are functionally independent, since robotic independence requires complex and expensive command processing computational and control units. Since the vast majority of automen operate in logistics or manufacturing industries, they are usually slaved to a facility Master Computer, which offloads most processing. In the case of maintenance and infrastructure, Master Computers may be consolidated into a region-wide single supercomputer, called an Automatic Asset Command.</p>
<p>This picture shows Tzipora socialising with a school maintenance robot, primarily used for vacuuming floors clean. It is connected to its Master Computer via cabling that runs in rails across the interior of the school, since radios are common enough here to interfere with communication between the automan and its computer. Behind her, a service automen used for crowd control, announcements and communication tells her to stop making friends with the maintenance droid. Incidents like these are common enough, and modern automens have security features to prevent vandalism and self-report damage.</p>
<p>A final question remains ‚Äî if Vekllei has entered post-scarcity using robots, why does the rest of the world not simply replicate them? The simple answer is that they do, and the synthetic automan was not invented in Vekllei ‚Äî it was invented in Poland, and copied by West Germany. They are used world-over in manufacturing and industry. But Vekllei is unique in its heavy use of vehicle automen in public areas, for the simple fact that the economics of robotics just don‚Äôt make sense anywhere else in the world. Even in economies of scale, it is too expensive to grow a brain to replace human janitors, milkmen or refuse collectors. Automen demand enormous amounts of electricity, and require complex maintenance and special nutrient fuels to work. These expenses make sense in the contexts of sophisticated manufacturing, but don‚Äôt add up in unskilled work where they would be subject to vandalism and theft. In a world of dwindling resources and a rising tide of instability, the problem is much larger than a simple lack of automen or the fact that people must work ‚Äî a limit has been reached, and robots as we currently understand them will always be more expensive than human life.</p>
<p>Vekllei, in its soviet approach to science, sees these wonders of the atomic age wandering school halls, crushing shoes.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/rocket.jpg"/> <p><strong>The New Year in Vekllei rings out during its months of darkness and cold</strong>. This calendar runs the regular affairs of the country, like it does the modern world. To Vekllei people, however, it is plain that New Years occurs not in darkness but instead in the summer solstice in June, the way it has for thousands of years in the dramatic cycles of light and dark in the country. In this sense, the end of December resonates among businesses and little else, much like the financial year elsewhere. An ancient pagan festival, one of twelve each year, takes its place in summer. This event is called <em>Rascismion</em>, or ‚ÄúRebirth of the Season‚Äù in the old Vekllei usage of the word ‚Äî meaning the complete cycle of seasons.</p>
<p>As a spiritual artefact of <em>Upen</em>, it is no surprise that the Solstice brings good luck and rebirth to Vekllei. It marks good fortune then, that the assembly and launch of the <em>Desg</em> met the Solstice, launching for Jupiter‚Äôs Europa just before midnight on June 21st, 2064. Constructed by the <em>Solar Concern of the Vekllei Commonwealth Materials Bureau</em> (or Solaburo) in cooperation with the <em>Rocket Navy of the Vekllei Commonwealth Armed Forces</em> and the <em>Cosmos Office</em> (or Cosmoburo), the <em>Desg</em> will land material on Europa to prepare for human arrival in six years. It is named after the Desg creatures of Vekllei mythology, who passed messages between malicious and benevolent factions of creatures before human settlement.</p>
<p>Although it was nearly midnight, it was the Solstice and the sun would not set tonight. Ayn and Tzipora had spread out plates of Vekllei <em>Kimisosyo</em> stew across a blanket just south of the Lita Cosmodrome to watch the launch. The <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/lita">Royal Borough of Lita</a> was not far from Copette (<a href="https://millmint.net/images/railmap.jpg">map of Vekllei here</a>), one of the Five Crown Boroughs of Vekllei, but this was Vekllei‚Äôs glacial interior and it felt a million miles from anywhere. Its geography was ancient and violent, strikingly barren and brutally volcanic. Why visit Europa? It was alien enough here.</p>
<p>Ayn had brought her portable television. Baron was supposed to meet them there, but his train was delayed and he was stuck somewhere in <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/miyatvousi/">Miyatvousi</a> with the beer and fruit spritzers. Tzipora liked a drink, but Ayn liked it too much and had given it up years ago.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI suppose it‚Äôs better than being drunk,‚Äù Tzipora said, nursing a fizzy drink.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs not at all, Zelda‚Ä¶ Getting drunk feels great, that‚Äôs why I got drunk,‚Äù Ayn said. She was watching some teen-agers cuddling further down the hill, and sighed after a moment. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the trouble with it. A warm night like this, tired and with nothing to do? It‚Äôs the best feeling in the world. Let‚Äôs not kid ourselves.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI like wine,‚Äù Tzipora said stupidly before erring a moment later, embarrassed at how childish she sounded. ‚ÄúWell, you know. I drink alcohol, but not much. I like sweet things mostly.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ayn felt sorry for girl as the awkwardness of the conversation settled on Tzipora. It was worse to be self-aware, sometimes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBaron likes a drink,‚Äù Tzipora continued. ‚ÄúHe drinks a lot. He‚Äôs okay though, I don‚Äôt think he can get drunk. He‚Äôs a cool cucumber, he doesn‚Äôt change at all.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIs that right? Anyway, what time is it? It‚Äôll be launching soon.‚Äù</p>
<p>As the minutes ticked closer to launch, Tzipora began to fret that Baron wouldn‚Äôt make it. The New Year was very important to her.</p>
<p>He was out-of-breath and wrestling a crate of beer back under his arm as the distant boom of the atomic thrusters caught the mountaintops. He crested the hill as a dull roar invited the distant glitter of rocket engines that flickered out of the Lita Cosmodrome Launch Basin. He saw Ayn and Tzipora not far away and called to them, but they couldn‚Äôt hear him ‚Äî the <em>Desg</em> had called in the New Year, and all eyes were on it as it shined in the sky, brightest of all the stars. 2064 had became 2065, or Year 59 of the Floral Period.</p>
<p><strong>Happy New Year!</strong></p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/army.jpg"/> <p><strong>There‚Äôs a thousand years of history in Vekllei‚Äôs armed forces</strong>, though you‚Äôll find very little of it recalled casually today. Almost everything about Vekllei‚Äôs prewar society was scorched by the bombs, and the scraps of military infrastructure that survived were appropriated in the subsequent British occupation.</p>
<p>Since independence, a slate has been wiped clean, and a modern fighting force has replaced the colonial legions and battleships of yesteryear. Since reestablishment, Vekllei‚Äôs mettle has been tested in the jungles of Taiwan and the arctic deserts alike, and have proven themselves to be a rugged, versatile army of considerable bravery and fighting strength in spite of poor equipment in the bankruptcy of independence. Attached to British units in Taiwan and sent carelessly into dirty work, the Vekllei Army today has forged new prestige in the blood of its rebirth. Although Vekllei is an island nation, it maintains a large professional and conscripted army and is the third-largest contributor of personnel towards U.N. peacekeeping internationally.</p>
<h2 id="army-types">
  Army Types
  <a class="anchor" href="#army-types">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Pictured here is a coalition of soldiers from different branches of the army. Let‚Äôs explore some of them now. Please note that this list is not comprehensive, and merely represents a portion of Vekllei&rsquo;s most common army branches.</p>
<h3 id="armipor">
  Armipor
  <a class="anchor" href="#armipor">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The <em>Armipor</em> (armi denporitsa, or <em>army police</em>), are a special branch of the secretive cross-bureau Military Intelligence Operations Council, which joins Vekllei‚Äôs sprawling espionage networks with its military infrastructure. The Armipor have many duties, including conventional military police-work, but may also engage in intelligence-gathering, counter-terrorism and rural policing work depending on the division.</p>
<h3 id="somitzisma">
  Somitzisma
  <a class="anchor" href="#somitzisma">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Somitzisma (meaning <em>militia groups</em>) are formal army units with training somewhere between active reservists and independent militias. Unlike reservists, they are not assigned uniforms and generally receive only periodic training. Their training focuses on a hypothetical home front, specialising in improvised warfare, urban combat and ambushes. They number some 2 million total, and represent one to the largest equipped militia forces in the world. This number would likely rapidly inflate during wartime due to high rates of firearm ownership in the country.</p>
<h3 id="macka">
  Macka
  <a class="anchor" href="#macka">#</a>
</h3>
<p>A ‚Äúmacka‚Äù is prewar Vekllei slang for a blunt tool or implement, and at some point during occupation and independence it became attached to Vekllei‚Äôs general infantry. Vekllei mackas number some 90,000 serving, and make up the bulk of Vekllei‚Äôs professionalised infantry. Mackas are reinforced by nearly a million active reservists, conscripted through Mandatory Service and equipped for defensive fighting. Their equipment varies dramatically, since they are trained for a variety of environments, including Vekllei‚Äôs warm southern climates and arctic warfare.</p>
<h3 id="carasbine">
  Carasbine
  <a class="anchor" href="#carasbine">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The Carasbine (commandos, derived from <em>carbine</em>), are Vekllei‚Äôs special forces. Broadly defined as any Vekllei army unit attached to unconventional forms of warfare (since counterterrorism and domestic paramilitary roles are served by the <a href="https://millmint.net/posts/2020-07-08-police/"><em>venopor</em></a>), the country‚Äôs strategic focus on high-value and covert ops require a flexible fighting force. Although structured within Vekllei‚Äôs army hierarchy, their function has considerable latitude among divisions and often intersects with active operations planned and directed by the bureaus of National Intelligence. To this end, Vekllei maintains commandos trained for sabotage, hostage-rescue, special offensive action, combat diving, and manhunts. They often support and work alongside espionage agents of the NI bureaus.</p>
<h3 id="tzipora">
  Tzipora
  <a class="anchor" href="#tzipora">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Tzipora does not have a gun and is not very good at killing the enemy and/or invading foreign nations.</p>
<p>She does, however, enlist in the Garden Corps for Mandatory Service and spends her military years growing flowers in street garden boxes, severely distracting any foreign invading force with their beauty.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/deadplanes.jpg"/> <p><strong>Pachinki is a world of Tzipora‚Äôs own creation</strong>, a dorky retreat from the difficulties she has in Vekllei. Tzipora always loved stories of wild places and adventure, and Pachinki blossomed organically from within her daydreams. Eventually she started writing and drawing it. When she was sad, bored or anxious, she would descend back into Pachinki‚Äôs world of ancient magic, edible gems and pirates.</p>
<p>A chapter she wrote in late November one year resembled her idea of a Christmas story, and so I‚Äôve included a portion here to accompany this picture.</p>
<hr>
<p>She wrote,</p>
<p>This story starts with the tale of a young Pilot Witch, whose job was to guide dead aircraft to safe airports in the shaky peace that followed the Black War. It had to be female witches, since men couldn‚Äôt see the dead. She would meet formations of heavy bombers and strike fighters stuffed with corpses out at sea and show them the safe paths to the landing strips, flying low and fast where the Palace Gods couldn‚Äôt see them. This was the safe part of the job, since the Palace Gods and Necropirates ambushed out at sea, where they could hide between the archipelagos. Over land, they were mostly safe. It was an important job. Without the witch‚Äôs guidance, these planes would navigate the world forever, circling overhead, still packed with bombs.</p>
<p>The witches would guide the dead airmen down to the ground, where they could finally be relieved of their duty and released with proper burial rights. The planes would be repaired and flown back to the royal palace in Lily. This young witch was glad it was once again peacetime; when the empires warred, they couldn‚Äôt keep up with the dead planes.</p>
<p>Once, she was told to meet a special transport delegation out at sea. They didn‚Äôt explain anything more. She flew out to the coast on her broom and the glint of a wingtip caught her eye. As it approached, her instinct flared with alarm. These were not dead planes ‚Äî the crew in them were very much alive. She flew out and approached the largest aircraft in the formation, a transport bomber of a type she‚Äôd seen several times before. She landed atop the aircraft and made her way inside via a turret.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù The witch asked, irritated at the break in procedure. The captain of the aircraft jumped at the noise, and straightened his shoulders as he addressed her pompously.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here to guide us, are you? We‚Äôre from the Palace, in Lily.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI understand that; I saw your markings. But why‚Äôs it any of my business?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat do you mean, witch? We need safe passage, don‚Äôt we?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not my trade; what are you doing this far out? Do you have any idea how dangerous these archipelagos are?‚Äù</p>
<p>The captain snorted and resettled his cap.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou know what time of year it is, don‚Äôt you? All five planets are above us, silly girl.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe other witches won‚Äôt like you coming in uninvited, I‚Äôll have you warned.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nearly the time for the festival. The Queen wants fine gifts for the Princess, and she won‚Äôt do with any old hat or dress. We‚Äôre part of a military attach√© that‚Äôs spent the last six months searching the lands for the finest gifts in the world.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúGifts,‚Äù the witch said, betraying her surprise. ‚ÄúW-what sort of gifts?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWell, how about you head below deck and see for yourself. While you‚Äôre there, why don‚Äôt you pick something out? Provided we understand each other, of course.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWell, all right. Okay,‚Äù the witch said, and hurriedly turned away from the bridge.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the witch was once again atop her broom, though somewhat unevenly under the weight of the largest gem necklace she‚Äôd ever seen. She couldn‚Äôt believe her luck; it was laden with Soup Gems, and they hadn‚Äôt been seen around here in nearly a hundred years. You only found them growing in the stomachs of the Kemi people, and they had been wiped out many eons ago. A gem like this would produce excellent powders, and make her very powerful for a time.</p>
<p>She resettled her pilot‚Äôs hat, and placed both hands on her broomstick. She felt the wind swirl around her as she shot to the front of the formation.</p>
<p>‚Äî</p>
<p>The witch depicted here looks awfully like Tzipora, and that‚Äôs no coincidence. Tzipora is always somewhere in her own stories. She writes herself in because she likes to imagine herself living among these people, flying on broomsticks and becoming a powerful witch.</p>
<p>These types of posts aren‚Äôt very regular, but they‚Äôre important for my health as an illustrator. Vekllei might be fantastical, but it‚Äôs a Cold War consumer society at the end of the day. Pachinki provides me (and Tzipora!) a fun holiday now and then, into a surreal world of planetoids and magic.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any questions. You can read other Pachinki posts (quite old now) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/ar8jov/a_gem_girl_shows_off_her_enormous_strength_in/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/ba3mb4/the_littlest_goddess_in_pachinki/">here</a>.

And <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/de25mz/the_mountain_witches_of_pachinki_and_the/">here</a>. That‚Äôs all of them, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever done. This project‚Äôs been going on for a while.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/sundown.jpg"/> <p><strong>She‚Äôd dropped out of school and had the slow accent of a person too foreign to employ</strong>. She now lived in a country that did not use money. Food was everywhere and you ate until you were satisfied. Around each corner was a new cinema or basement lounge, and water trickled through the streets like all mythic garden cities. It was a paradise.</p>
<p>Somehow, despite her new wealth, a panic had set in. School hadn‚Äôt worked out and she lived parasitically with a person who hadn‚Äôt really expected or wanted to take her. Desperate to justify her presence as an immigrant, she started to cook ‚Äî first from the TV, then out of books. A year into her new life in utopia, she had the makings of a master home cook, serving hot suppers six days a week. On Sundays Baron made a roast.</p>
<p>Vekllei is the sort of place that rewards attention to common things, and Tzipora soon cultivated a chef‚Äôs eye for fresh ingredients and learned how to bargain with grocers for the best produce. She would plan her meals carefully and indulged her Colombian childhood, rediscovering the bandeja paisa and flatbreads of her youth.</p>
<p>She was relaying her sadness at being unemployed one day when Baron asked her ‚Äúwhy not become a cook?‚Äù Somehow the thought had never occurred to her. She began to walk into restaurants and ask for work ‚Äî but most restaurants in Vekllei are run by families, and have no interest in expanding their kitchen for teenage foreigners. There was a restaurant two stops away on the Lola Main Line she liked especially: The Bull, or ‚ÄúToro‚Äù, was run by a loud Spaniard called Che who‚Äôd opened his kitchen into the dining area, so you could see him cook. He was rude ‚Äî Tzipora‚Äôs native fluency picked up more than your average Vekllei person ‚Äî but more importantly, he was an excellent, classically-trained chef. In any other city in the world, he might have been celebrated, but here he ran his business beneath a print shop in the artist‚Äôs quarter of Lola.</p>
<p>She asked him for work in the kitchen ‚Äî any work, and he told her no. She finished her meal and left. The next time, he shouted her out of his restaurant. She continued to look around for work, but a quiet stubbornness deep in her heart had convinced her that el Toro is where she wanted to be. She started waiting until closing, where she would ambush him. Six weeks into her courting, Che told Tzipora that she should be sent to an asylum if she wanted to wash dishes so much ‚Äî but if she would stop bothering him, he would expect her at 2pm the next day.</p>
<p>It was hard work and it was unrewarding work. In her first year she was ostensibly a commis chef in a kitchen of six ‚Äî but spent more time with her hands in the sink than preparing food. She would occasionally handle ingredients prep too, and had to reach the markets in the early morning to get the best produce or face having a pan thrown at her in the evening. She worked five nights a week from 2pm till the early hours of the morning. Che ran his kitchen like it was in Barcelona. Sometimes she would step out for a cigarette and fall asleep on the stair in the alley, sweat glistening under the streetlamp, cooled by the ocean stir.</p>
<p>Three years into her work at el Toro she would replace the outgoing sous-chef, and her talent as a cook blossomed. It was a peculiar sight, to have someone of Tzipora‚Äôs height and appearance shouting at young men, totally secure in her authority. The years of labour had hardened her resolve, and refined her intuition. She wouldn‚Äôt be a chef all her life, but she would always be a wonderful cook. In a country of rich foods and hearty wines, that was a precious commodity. More importantly, her persistence in that kitchen earned her place in the country ‚Äî Vekllei was a land of opportunity, after all. It is one thing to visit paradise, but quite another to be a part of it.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/gods.jpg"/> <p><strong>It would be misleading to characterise Vekllei as environmentalist in the usual idea of the word</strong>. Vekllei is no such thing. This is obvious in subtle ways, like Newda‚Äôs <em>Dumousiantopet</em>, or ‚Äúbeautiful and seperate,‚Äù which advocates the separation of human and natural design. It is also policy; Vekllei is dependent on its landscape as part of <em>Autosuffisouitopet</em>, or ‚Äúself-sustenance,‚Äù and to this end sinks forests for hydroelectric dams and topples mountains for novel urban projects.</p>
<p>But unlike most developed countries, Vekllei policy is still informed by an unwavering fear of the natural world. This is a country where belief in demons and fairies and trolls abound; where rivers carry names and biographies; and where Upen‚Äôs gentle animism resurrects most material into life. Vekllei is also geologically active, home to some of the world‚Äôs largest active volcanoes that grow in the tectonic fissures atop which the country sits. The forests they may sink; but should certain mountains come back to life, entire cities will be consumed in fire and ash.</p>
<p>This inspires a fear of nature as old as the history of human settlement in the country. Most Vekllei people worship a pantheon of traditional animist gods alongside abrahamic or local faiths. This is a culture in which all things have value, and so the national superego has declined to position human civilisation as unique and consequently exploitative. To this end, Vekllei‚Äôs segregationist environmental policy is inversely a symptom of this direct connection with nature, and a cultural fear of the unknown.</p>
<p>Today, this is obvious in the ‚Äúforbidden regions‚Äù of the country. After the war, vast territories of the interior were designated as <em>Kronaismioudelfia</em>, or ‚Äúcrown land‚Äù. These forbid sovereign entry or human exploration in any capacity other than personal curiosity. These are dark pockets of ancient wilderness, where myth and legend abound. If you enter them and become lost, only volunteers will seek you out ‚Äî for the purposes of the Vekllei government, you have exited the sovereignty of the nation-state. They function in part as natural reservations, but that neglects just how isolated, wild and untouchable these regions are.</p>
<p>At first glance, this might seem archaic and superstitious, but like most spirituality-as-policy in the country, it serves a foundational component of Vekllei society (and subsequently, the economy). As Vekllei seeks out deindustrialisation via post-scarcity systems, a sincere respect for landscape as living and dangerous becomes essential. Mere appreciation or stewardship in abstract is, by Vekllei metrics, not much different than naked exploitation. Removing human constructions from landscape also necessitates the dismantling of landscape, cartography and tourism conceptually. There are few national parks in the country, but hundreds of <em>Kronaismioudelfia</em>. Deep within them lurk unmapped, undocumented things ‚Äî and at their hearts are pure springs, grasslands of eternal life, spirit dwellings and the souls of your ancestors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this image, Tzipora meets her reflection with the <a href="/factbook/society/culture/language/#6-upotenne">Upotenne</a> sign for peace and friendliness. Reflections of mirror-pools in Vekllei are believed to be places to meet spirits. While your reflection may not be a spirit, your reflection is closer to their world than your own, as a deconstruction of image and physicality. In this sense, Tzipora is hoping her gesture may carry through into the other worlds and convince them of human peacefulness. Such gestures are good manners, considering she is no longer in sovereign human territory and stands in the land of gods.</p>

<p><strong>She would spend a long time by the rivulet that ran behind her apartment.</strong> She would do the housework and hang the wash out, then watch the water trickle past in the sun.</p>
<p>She tried to open a jar the other day and started to cry when she couldn‚Äôt get it open. She never cried once when she saw those things in America, or got beat to shit, but these days she cried over jam. She didn‚Äôt know what was going on. Things were getting worse.</p>
<p>She caught her reflection in the rivulet‚Äôs water. It provoked a nausea. She was so tired. What would stop her from plunging her face into the river until she slipped right in? Would she drown and float away, never to be seen again? Or maybe, in a miracle, she might grow gills and fins and swim away, her life-force put to better use as a fish or turtle.</p>
<p>How do you resolve an ache to confess sadness to someone and the instinct to protect your emotions? It wasn‚Äôt in her nature to tell people about her feelings. On some level, she looked down on it; every cell of her body told her to suffer in silence. She wore the same clothes every day. Why did she wear the same clothes every day?</p>
<p>It is a fierce thing to discover within yourself that which you despise the most. She watched the foam gather around a stick wedged in the bank of the rivulet. If she‚Äôd been born elsewhere, into power and wealth rather than girlishness and poverty, she would have made an excellent thug. She wondered how much management she needed. Why was it so hard to live?</p>
<p>She tasted the water from the rivulet and it was cold and sweet, and said a prayer to the rivulet for its purity no matter what happened to her. The wash was dry on the line.</p>

<p><strong>For all you&rsquo;ve seen of Vekllei and her characters</strong>, you&rsquo;ve never heard a single one of them speak. This post marks a little exploration into the Vekllei language, and a &lsquo;soft launch&rsquo; of my website, <a href="https://millmint.net">https://millmint.net</a>. The proper launch will come at the end of the month.</p>
<p>This post will briefly discuss some elements shown in this infographic, <a href="https://millmint.net//factbook/vekllei/language">but a large article on the language has been drafted here</a>. If you have some interest in constructed language, and some of the more playful aspects of Vekllei&rsquo;s evolving utopian communication systems, I encourage you to take a look at it. The website is incomplete, and both the articles on characters and Vekllei itself are very incomplete. Otherwise, a growing archive, essays, and issues of the <em>Atlantic</em> Bulletin are all available. Have a poke around, and let me know if anything breaks! The site has dark mode, if you&rsquo;re a gamer. Just click the moon.</p>
<h3 id="one-language-many-parts">
  One Language, Many Parts
  <a class="anchor" href="#one-language-many-parts">#</a>
</h3>
<p>To borrow from the article linked above, the Vekllei language has six core systems often referred to as sublanguages. They are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://millmint.net//factbook/society/culture/language/#21--spoken-vekllei"><strong>Spoken Vekllei</strong></a>, which is everyday spoken language. It draws from two glossaries with different meanings and feelings, called <em>Oa</em> and <em>Loh</em>.</li>
<li><a href="https://millmint.net//factbook/society/culture/language/#22--topet"><strong>Topet</strong></a>, which are logographic characters (occasionally characterised as hieroglyphs). Like other pictographic languages, <em>Topet</em> characters can be broken down into repeating components, called <em>Topotte</em>.</li>
<li><a href="https://millmint.net//factbook/society/culture/language/#23--rapotenne"><strong>Rapotenne</strong></a>, is the traditional logographic language of names. It is much older than Topet, and has more in common with spiritual runes than modern logography.</li>
<li><a href="https://millmint.net//factbook/society/culture/language/#24--potenne"><strong>Potenne</strong></a>, lit. ‚Äú<em>Hand-Talk</em>‚Äù, is a sign language that incorporates gestures and signing to add meaning to emotion to spoken language, and occasionally in place of it.</li>
<li><a href="https://millmint.net//factbook/society/culture/language/#25--upotenne"><strong>Upotenne</strong></a>, lit. ‚Äú<em>Spirit-Hand-Talk</em>‚Äù, as the recreation of runes in human form, used limitedly in spiritual ritual.</li>
<li><a href="https://millmint.net//factbook/society/culture/language/#26--vekllei-semaphore"><strong>Vekllei Semaphore</strong></a> is the codification of colour and shape. Traditionally limited to colour, shape and pattern are now also included in <em>Vekllei Semaphore</em>, in which full sentences can be formed.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="in-this-picture">
  In This Picture
  <a class="anchor" href="#in-this-picture">#</a>
</h3>
<p>We can see various parts of the Vekllei sublanguages on display, including <em>Topet</em>, <em>Rapotenne</em>, <em>Potenne</em> and <em>Vekllei Semaphore</em>. Before Cobian gets close enough to say hello, Tzipora has already delivered a devastating compliment via a simple three-finger tap to the palm, admiring how she looks. A couple of descriptions of Tzipora written in <em>Topet</em> have been annotated on her left, to demonstrate its use, including a tongue-twister (&ldquo;She always tucks her shirt&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;Louisn Laismoh Loah Liousmineh&rdquo;). You&rsquo;ll notice <em>Topet</em> looks especially hieroglyphic, even by pictographic standards.</p>
<p>Tzipora&rsquo;s full Blood Name is spelled out in <em>Rapotenne</em> below, which is markedly different from <em>Topet</em> in history, characters and grammar. Most formal names in Vekllei employ a seal in place of writing it out in full ornamentation, which has been provided below along with a formal signature. Her signature is entirely pictographic; elements are arranged according to symbolic value, rather than phonological legibility.</p>
<p>On the right, we can see an example of how Semaphore lives up to its name through its presence on flags, reinforcing and communicating information without conventional literacy. Also shown are a handful of basic symbols as they relate to authority, with the landscape of Vekllei superseding all human organs. Their colours matter, and so their meanings are more complex than what is described here &ndash; for example, a small black circle refers to a human being, but an orange one refers to an arctic person (usually Vekllei).</p>
<p>Finally, we have a breakdown of the word <em>comiya</em> (<a href="https://millmint.net//factbook/society/culture/language/#222-phonetic-reading">also looked at here</a>), which means &ldquo;friend.&rdquo; Tzipora and Cobian are <em>comiya</em>, and Moise and Cobian are&hellip; sort of <em>comiya</em>. The introduction here of <em>phonetic complements</em>, which are duplicate consonant-pairs used to slightly alter the semantic meaning of a word without changing its pronunciation, allows the idea of a &ldquo;friend&rdquo; to be conceptualised in many different ways, to encompass all sorts of relationships. This one here implies a sort of na√Øve love (by using characters for late autumn, young woman and a glacial beach, all pronounced /k/.)</p>
<p>Limpettes are tails that underline vowel-forms called <em>hieyerette</em> to enhance legibility. Although ornamented <em>Topet</em> has visually distinct consonant-pairings, business <em>Topet</em> does not generally use superscript and so limpettes designate the vowel-form. If you&rsquo;re a bit lost, that&rsquo;s okay. It&rsquo;s in the main article, and I don&rsquo;t want to make this post too long.</p>
<p>You can imagine then, even with only a handful of examples of language in practice here, how complex Vekllei can become as phonological and semantic meaning compound, combine and seperate in different forms and contexts. The spoken word can be altered by the physical gesture, and the physical gesture can be altered by the written word.</p>

<p><strong>When the light shifted just right</strong>, the ceramic tiles and concrete footpaths twinkled like water off the back of a swan. 16th Century witches could build a hut in the woods and forage for herbs; 21st Century witches were susceptible to modernist persuasions.</p>
<p>The Demotic Meeting Hall was constructed twenty years prior as the main meeting hall of the National Dockworker‚Äôs Union. Situated on the coast, and along the recently-built monorail line to Roya, it dominated the coastline like a mythic lighthouse. Where the cathedrals of Europe built spires to God, Vekllei built towers for dockmen. At 112 meters tall, the hall‚Äôs colossal window structures were awesome within, and its massive bronze ornament glittered for miles. It was palatial.</p>
<p>The Dockworker‚Äôs Union moved west to Montre at some point, so these days it was simply the Roya Demotic Community Hall. It was used for all sorts of things, not least of which domestic tourism. Its lookout provided views across the North-West Fjords. When Tzipora first arrived in Vekllei, the scale and decadence of it appealed to her enormously. It was depicted on her language booklet, and since then she‚Äôd developed a minor fascination with the structure.</p>
<p>She got her chance to visit upon her invitation to a costume party hosted by the Chef‚Äôs Concern. Tzipora is a witchy sort of person, and the idea of going as a witch appealed to her. She already had the wardrobe ‚Äî as Cobian remarked:</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôve put on a hat and you‚Äôre holding a stick ‚Äî that‚Äôs it.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my costume,‚Äù Zelda said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a witch.‚Äù</p>
<p>You can see her here attempting to recreate the sumptuous curve of the Meeting Hall in witch form.</p>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>&ldquo;He not busy being born is busy dying,&rdquo; ‚Äî that‚Äôs off a Bob Dylan bootleg. I‚Äôve just finished my thesis and I‚Äôm busy being born again. Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm busy dying. Drawing‚Äôs been the way out for a long time now.</p>
<p>As of today I‚Äôm starting work full-time on a Vekllei comic called Atomic Modern. The front cover looks like a textbook. The name is not that interesting. That‚Äôs okay ‚Äî apparently my honours in media didn‚Äôt do anything for my marketing ability, but this project is about celebrating mundanity and restraint. Tzipora‚Äôs got a fag in her mouth but it isn‚Äôt lit. I feel like that a lot of the time. It‚Äôs a self-contained image.</p>
<p>Atomic Modern is about Tzipora and Vekllei. It‚Äôs about her friends and her memories and all the good and bad parts of her life. It‚Äôs about what went down in America and how you can justify living. It‚Äôll have beautiful Vekllei landscapes and characters in muted colour. It will also include passages that act as a guide to Vekllei and society ‚Äî diagrams, infographics and footnotes. It‚Äôs also an escape from everything going on right now ‚Äî there‚Äôs good and bad in all stories, but at the end of the day Vekllei is a utopia.</p>
<p><strong>I will publish pages here for free</strong>. <a href="https://www.patreon.com/vekllei">I‚Äôll collate them into chapters available exclusively to my patrons</a>. Maybe some extra stuff too. I‚Äôm a good dad to my patrons. I already made a set of postcards and sent them out. Either way, you‚Äôll continue to see stuff here.
This is exciting, isn‚Äôt it? This is a new chapter for me as an artist. It‚Äôs a vulnerable moment for me, because up until now it‚Äôs just sort of been ‚Äúposting on reddit‚Äù. I don‚Äôt have a publisher, I‚Äôm not trained, I‚Äôm just some guy. But this is what I‚Äôve always wanted to do, and I‚Äôm trying to get busy being born again.</p>
<p>There should be regular world posts here still. There‚Äôs drawings I like to do that just don‚Äôt fit into a comic format. I think during weekdays I‚Äôll work on the comic and on weekends I‚Äôll do a painting. We‚Äôll see how it goes.</p>
<p>Also, I‚Äôll have a nice big wiki soon with multiple language support. I‚Äôll let you know when it‚Äôs done.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs start this again, with all that off my chest.</p>
<p>Hi, I‚Äôm Hobart. I‚Äôm busy getting born again.</p>
<p>Much love,</p>

<p><strong>Tanizaki JunichiroÃÑ, 1918</strong></p>
<p><strong>The wind had died and it seemed that she would follow it</strong>. Crazy shadows distorted beneath car headlights. It occurred to her in some way that, as she approached dying, she was living out the ultimate dramatic fantasy of the American misplaced girl, in the same way the townsmen were fulfilling their grotesque constellation of death by murdering women. To them, she was not Zelda, or an agitator, or even a maid from Motel Grande; she was just a girl of girl-form, washed out; beat in; bent before the death-bridge where the creek rolled on below. It was brutal and violent, and also the most tacky thing. It scaled up and down, because it was murdering.</p>
<p>The hearts of America are like overused sandpaper ‚Äî all dull. This is how it played out in 2063, ages into the Great American Decline and well before it was put down like a sick dog by Chinese methods. The worn out bodies of the hedonistic coasts were numb to the spectacle of collapse and found themselves displaced and unfeeling, and so the neurotic motions of vampiric culture barons responded. In 2036, long before the Dallas Secession or Zelda‚Äôs birthday, the NBC under the Radio Corporation of America broadcast the first televised execution in the United States of child serial killer Wayne Graham. This enticed similar coverage across all major television networks for subsequent executions, which were viewed by millions of Americans. The format culminated in NBC‚Äôs The <em>American Justice Show</em> programme, in which the method and subject of broadcasted executions were made participatory by public poll. It was tremendously successful but was cancelled in 2041, after the botched death of George Kovacs.</p>
<p>This is not necrotic; this is neurotic; it is the ultimate sucking up of human desire into the commodity-form, and it was only the beginning. It is not just a poetic coincidence that the cancellation of <em>American Justice</em> saw the legalisation (or at the very least, decriminalisation) of prostitution in all regions but the Deep South over the next decade (which would contribute to the eventual secession). This is pleasure in its raw form, and the murder of prostituted immigrant-labourers and the eroticisation of the death of Wayne Graham‚Äôs teen-age victims was one and the same. The necroticisation would arrive later, as modernity tumoured and pleasure outpaced the sovereignty of the federal government.</p>
<p>Here was Zelda, who was a perfect caricature of the real American in the 21st century ‚Äî born overseas, poor as shit, and dressed up for dying. And why shouldn‚Äôt she die? All the old things were dead. God, kings, outrage, empathy, optimism ‚Äî it was all thrown in the creek, with the rest of the immigrant-labourers. Why shouldn‚Äôt a child and her sensitivity be among them? You could change the channel on television and see pornography and the brutal violence of the Secession adjacent to each other. If you clicked the knob back and forth fast enough, they could become one and the same.</p>
<p>Tzipora was the last to arrive and among the first to be lynched, and maybe they would make postcards out of her dead body. She couldn‚Äôt even wonder this in her terror; the thought would only occur to her much later. It seemed like the whole Great American Decline, in all its hungry decomposition and hedonism was leading to this single moment ‚Äî and all that was once solid melts into Zelda.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Vekllei‚Äôs obvious contradictions are commonly referenced, but not always clear</strong>. Why are parts of Vekllei epistemology, or the ‚ÄòVekllei way of thinking,‚Äô contradictory? And if these are contradictions, then surely they must fall apart when they‚Äôre examined? How is it possible to hold two contradictory ideas at the same time and apply them? Let‚Äôs look at Product Atheism, Vekllei‚Äôs foundation for necroeconomics.</p>
<p><em>Atismoprodarte</em>, lit. ‚Äúproduct atheism,‚Äù is the process by which Vekllei culture breaks down and rebuilds social preconceptions of objects, including products. Vekllei does not really have <strong>commodities</strong> in the traditional idea of the word, so it is supplemented here by ‚Äò<strong>product</strong>,‚Äô which more closely resembles the Vekllei word for commodity-forms: <em>prodart</em> or <em>prodatte</em>. This concept is a part of <em>Upen</em>, which is found throughout Vekllei culture and its constitution, and coexists agnostically with organised religion.</p>
<p>‚ÄúProduct Atheism‚Äù is the term for how Vekllei people think about the objects that make up their lives ‚Äî clothes, appliances, toys, trinkets and treasures. These things are not quite commodities, because they are not ‚Äúsold‚Äù. Vekllei does not use money, and so it does not produce items of any economic value.</p>
<p>An object‚Äôs economic form, then, is replaced by social form. Among Marxists, they call these social forms <em>fetishistic</em>, because products are given lives of their own and exist independently of the labour that created them. But this doesn‚Äôt work in Vekllei, because</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Labour-value is social, not economic</strong>. Vekllei people are not paid for work and they do not pay money for products. All work is for social reasons; all consumption is for social needs. Any object that is prohibited from the ordinary Vekllei person is merely landscape; it has no form.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Labour-value is simultaneously suppressed, in imitation of commodity, and celebrated, in imitation of dereification</strong>. Vekllei shops look like any foreign shops, because they participate in the same fantasy ritual of shopping and allow easy access to products. At the same time, Upen emphasises the importance of local consumption and objects made by hand, and so Vekllei appliances are generally hand-made. This creates a social bond between the producer and consumer, and breaks down commodity-form, but it can‚Äôt escape the fetishised valuations encouraged by the consumer-fantasy. So it is neither a social or economic product while being both; resulting in a permanent contradiction.</p>
<p>In fact, Vekllei ‚ÄòProduct Atheism‚Äô is more or less a rejection of Marxist commodity fetishism, and instead advocates product-worship. This is because objects in Vekllei are regarded as fantasy, and are eroticised by a fantasy market. This is a symptom of the unspoken truth most foreigners are well aware of ‚Äî Vekllei does not have an economy; <strong>the Vekllei economy is dead; the economy has been reanimated and is zombified</strong>. No money changes hands, no product has value, and all products are abstracted and exclusively physical simultaneously.</p>
<p>Thus Product Atheism has two contradictions; first, that the participatory market economy of Vekllei is both alive and dead, making it both undead and unaliave, and second, that products are both abstracted by Product Atheism and then unabstracted through Product Atheism at the same time, leaving them formless and unconstructed ‚Äî and, per Upen‚Äôs definitions, truly personal and intimate.</p>
<p>Acknowledging this necroeconomic construction destroys it, and so a final truth is revealed. In Vekllei, the exchange of objects is a <strong>social formality</strong>, like their uniforms and sign-language, and is both entirely superfluous and essential to the functioning of the state. This is not Marxism; this is not even economic; this is Vekllei, and its cultural forms are what determine all constructions of society. Vekllei‚Äôs ‚Äòmaterial form‚Äô is actually cultural, and Upen is its culture.</p>
<p>Since Vekllei economic forms are not truly economic, it makes sense that Product Atheism does not merely apply to the economy. All products, or objects, are part of its frameworks. The example used in this picture, depicting women‚Äôs fashion, is a good example of how Upen brings together an abstract object value and a valueless physical object simultaneously. Clothes in Vekllei have a very powerful social function, enhanced by how colour and shape become forms of communication in themselves as part of Vekllei semaphore. Clothes are both figuratively and literally signifiers of personality and individual expression.</p>
<p>In Vekllei written script, called <em>Topet</em>, most traditional clothing items are each assigned a single character, giving them a transcendental pictographic quality, a feature impossible to replicate in phonetic speech. In this sense, the written description of a dress in Vekllei supersedes its spoken equivalent, privileging pictorial, transcendental imagery over literalism. This poetic form is part of product-worship, and thus part of Product Atheism. This means that, without even touching the sociological tastes and trends of clothing fashion in Vekllei, we can see Product Atheism smashing Western frameworks against their own assumptions, leaving much of Vekllei epistemology, even today, incomprehensible to ideology without <em>Upen</em> as its framework.</p>

<p><strong>For a brief period of time</strong>, Zelda and Cobian took it upon themselves to make something of their youth. Cobian fancied herself a gymnast, and though this ambition arrived too late and left too soon, she was quite good at it for a while. Tzipora was better suited on the trampoline, where her stiff leg didn‚Äôt give her as much trouble.</p>
<p>They trained for about two hours, and after practice they met up to travel home together. Their gymnasium was in a coastal town called Gigayeh, in the borough of Mirah. Here, sloping lava fields were cast in the sea, buried under fine black sand.</p>
<p>There was an hour and a half after practice before the evening train arrived to take them back home to Lola, and so they were left with not much to do. Gigayeh had beautiful empty beaches, littered with icebergs that caught the light like jewels, but Tzipora couldn‚Äôt swim and the water was freezing. They could have enjoyed caf√© food in the sun, but Cobian‚Äôs regimented home life had left her incapable of eating outside of her designated meals, and Tzipora could only drink so much coffee. Instead, most of these afternoons, they found themselves sitting on the ocean promenade, watching a handful of locals go about their business as they counted the minutes.</p>
<p>In the moment, it was stupefyingly boring. They‚Äôd spent all day at school with each other and usually couldn‚Äôt conjure a word between them. Tzipora would make a remark about a seabird, because she liked them. She had been learning a lot about birds. Sometimes they would share a comic, but they read too fast to fill time. Most of it was spent in the sea air, feeling it grow colder as the day waned, watching the same ocean foam throw itself onto glittering volcanic sand.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs a horned puffin. That‚Äôs special,‚Äù Tzipora said out loud. Cobian didn‚Äôt even look up. Tzipora squinted.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo, wait, that‚Äôs just a regular one.‚Äù</p>
<p>In time, Tzipora would remember this period of her life fondly, and would visit Gigayeh to recapture that peace. As a teen-ager, however, those afternoons seemed to last forever.</p>

<p><strong>People are not sure what to make of Baron</strong>. They are not sure what to make of his daughter, Tzipora, either. To that end, they are lucky to have found each other.</p>
<p>His obscurity is part of a severe disposition, made obvious by his astonishing disinterest in friends and hobbies. When he finishes work, he listens to the radio, prepares supper, and goes to bed. His unrelenting seriousness is mitigated by his general passivity ‚Äî Baron is a man totally in control, who keeps to himself and does not take issue with what goes on around him. For his seriousness he is not particularly judgemental or opinionated. To call him boring would be a poor characterisation; he simply feels he has done enough and is not looking to complicate the basic equations of his life.</p>
<p>Tzipora (Zelda to him) complicates this equation. She‚Äôs similar to him in many ways, with her conservative personal disposition and humble lifestyle. She does not make a very good teen-ager.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs funny you say that. I was talking to her the other day, and she was talking about how nice it was to have some peace and quiet,‚Äù Baron once confided in Ayn. ‚ÄúOf course, she looks very young, so sometimes you have to remind yourself that she‚Äôs not a child. She‚Äôs not thirteen, she‚Äôs nineteen, and very unusual, I think. She‚Äôs very smart but she doesn‚Äôt let that on much.‚Äù</p>
<p>Tzipora did not really have ‚Äúphases‚Äù ‚Äî Tzipora was Tzipora, eternal. But she was a much more emotionally attuned person, and her highs were higher and her lowers were lower than anything Baron had felt in decades.</p>
<p>He was not always so unfeeling. Baron‚Äôs Ashkenazim parents were pulled straight from the bubbling diaspora of Eastern Europe. They met in the labour zionist movement, but fell out of love with professional organising and immigrated to a struggling Vekllei to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/g4wo2w/the_ou_hydroburo_office/">work in the national hydroelectricity scheme</a>, among thousands of immigrants employed by the Thunderburo.</p>
<p>He was born in 2027 and was not very interested in school as a child. He was rebellious and obstinate, and had only vague ambitions of acquiring a trade certificate in motorcycle repair. His sister, Amelie, died of tuberculosis when he was 11. That was about the end of school ambitions for him.</p>
<p>He started conscription early and spent his high school years in an army college. By the time he was 18, he was transferred to military police. It was 2045. He had started dating a middle school sweetheart, Ayn, two weeks before the war in Taiwan broke out.</p>
<p>Young Baron died in Taiwan, and another figure in his body returned. He was transferred almost immediately to a junior post at the Americas Bureau at National Intelligence (AB/NI), where he would spend the next decade. While he was stationed abroad, his mother died and his father followed. By this time, Baron was a significant asset for Vekllei‚Äôs deep autonomous intelligence work ‚Äî apolitical, unattached, unsentimental and steady on his feet. He was destined to die in Colombia, employed indefinitely and waiting to be used up. In 2063, he met a fellow Spanish-speaking Jew by name of Tzipora.</p>
<p>In many ways, his identity is as fractured as Tzipora‚Äôs, whose Jewish European ancestry was a novel curiosity and not much more. She considered herself a Latina-American until she was Vekllei, and since then she has not been anything more. That was how it went in Vekllei‚Äôs grand secular melting pot. Tzipora was still ta bubeleh to him, but by his mid-thirties Baron had lost most of his mother‚Äôs Yiddish.
Tzipora is his closest friend and daughter at the same time. She is a wholly energetic and independent agent in his life, and their relationship alternates awkwardly but intuitively between father-daughter and old friends. Ayn wonders if it is not a coincidence that Tzipora looks like Amelie, his sister.</p>
<p>The two of them champion the redemption of losers; the adrift, empty people of the world, acting on a chance to salvage a life and family. Tzipora expected to die in America; Baron expected nothing at all. But when Christmas comes around, and Ayn visits for supper, Taiwan and America melt into air; and their apartment houses the only Jewish Christmas tree in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p><strong>It&rsquo;s been a week since I&rsquo;ve posted</strong>. Most of that was spent drawing the same thing over and over.</p>
<p>A painting? Please. That&rsquo;s a day&rsquo;s work ‚Äî maybe two. A five second loop of Tzipora jumping in and shuffling over? A week.</p>

<p>The sketch was fun. It comes alive ‚Äî your precious characters become real. Then comes the inking. 38 lines traced and polished. Then comes the colouring. Good lord, the colouring. It isn&rsquo;t just labour-intensive &ndash; it&rsquo;s mind-numbingly boring.</p>
<p>This animation has a lot of little imperfections. No, I&rsquo;m not fixing them :)</p>

<p><strong>It was their first hike after Maya‚Äôs funeral</strong>. She had found adult life completely disappointing, and never moved out of home. In her last summer, she developed a desperate fascination with her receding childhood, and eventually took her own life outside of the classroom she‚Äôd studied in as a third-grade student.</p>
<p>Her death deeply disturbed Tzipora, who was keenly aware of how sentimental people died against metrics of their own imagination. She wondered if the government architects who designed schools and universities considered how those spaces gave life to memories. They were filled with lunchtimes and puppy love and old friends and your parents ‚Äî and those things folded into brick and concrete and linoleum floors. Fifty years earlier, some architect designed a classroom so valuable that Maya took her own life in the memory of it.</p>
<p>Their Puffling troop had set off for a camp site two hours away. Tzipora and Zo did not walk with them. They followed the flower tundra north, near where Zo and Maya had played as kids. At the base of an old oak, shrouded in a cool mist, Zo buried a pair of plastic earrings and laced school shoes, neither of which had been worn in a long time. Zo started to cry. Tzipora gave her some time to herself. After a while they drank hot tea with their feet in the creek. The mist had closed them in. There was good reason why people travelled to flower-tundras to meet with the dead. The mirror-pools and tombstone drumlins invoked the spirits.</p>
<p>After the tea, Zo pulled out her map and they set off again for the camp site, leaving the tree behind forever.</p>

<p><em>Another paint-sketch ‚Äî a painting done fast. I‚Äôm trying to learn to a) paint and b) paint on an industrial scale.</em></p>

<p>Callaisn was an oddity, built largely by the British during the occupation years in the fashion of London. It was nonetheless a thoroughly Vekllei borough, with its parks and tramways and rivulets, but it had a continental skyline marked by tower blocks and skyscrapers. A lot of boring business was done in Callaisn that Tzipora didn‚Äôt care about.</p>
<p>Cobian frowned as Tzipora rotated a second match between her thumb and finger. She didn‚Äôt like this nasty little habit she‚Äôd picked up. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll smell like your dad if you keep this up,‚Äù she said.</p>

<p><strong>They showed up at the autopool</strong>, and someone had just returned a brand new AAAC Voya Voya ‚Äî incredible. It was like Christ himself had blessed them. It only (barely) seat five, and there were six of them, but it wasn‚Äôt a problem. Moise would drive, Tzipora bunked with Cobian in the passenger seat and Alise, Zo and Jerome could cram into the back. It was a squeeze but with the top down and on the coastal highway it couldn‚Äôt have mattered less. It was the car of late summer.</p>
<p>Zo had just married Jerome, and they had recently moved in with each other at age 17. Tzipora had no metrics to figure out if that was too young, but Zo was her friend and young newlyweds were lonely people. She was all too ready to volunteer her labour (and that of Cobian and Moise) to drive them down to Koisniya and pick them up a coffee machine she‚Äôd ordered six months prior. Tohs S.p.A. was a good company but Tohs himself was a disorganised bastard and he‚Äôd rung up to a few times to tell her the order had been delayed. Then she called him back a month later and he said he‚Äôd never received the order. So it was that they were on their way now, well after Zo and Jerome had married, to pick up the wedding gift. That was just how things worked in Vekllei.</p>
<p>Zo‚Äôs friend Alise sat the coffee machine in her lap on the way back, and as the coastal highway reached Vik it skirted an incredible series of cliffs that they stopped to look at. The wind was out and the Atlantic churned beneath. The sun was hot on their skin. The coffee machine was left on the tiny back seat as they got out to have a look and take a picture.</p>

<p><strong>In Vekllei, uniforms are prevalent across all levels of society</strong>. They are perhaps the most obvious example of the opaque contradictions at the heart of Vekllei life, caught between wholly opposing ideas: between tradition and progress; liberty and control; and, most crucially here ‚Äî between individualism and the burden of society.</p>
<p>Depicted here are uniforms for education ‚Äî Tzipora as a puffling of the Puffin Scouts on the left, and the others in mere school uniforms. These uniforms are universal and used across all ages of schooling, from kindergarten to university. Even some teachers wear them ‚Äî it starts to stretch the conventional imagination about what constitutes a uniform.</p>
<p>A few observations on this picture:</p>
<p>First, these uniforms are used interchangeably across ages and disciplines. The difference between a red pleat skirt and a navy skirt is trivial; it is merely a difference in the meaning of the clothing, as part of Vekllei semaphore. They are both equally the school-mandated uniform of education, and can be worn interchangeably from one day to the next, in third grade and at university.</p>
<p>Second, there are many small uniquenesses in the uniform of each person, which are accentuated by their surrounding uniformity. Tzipora‚Äôs school shirt is pleated along the buttons, acquired off the rack of a department store. One pair of trousers might be a slightly different shade to the pair next to it. These discrepancies are not regarded as malfunctions of the uniform system, since the system is not designed to make each student conform to a single appearance ‚Äî it is about identity and convenience in a country that spent many decades clawing its way out of abject poverty.</p>
<p>These principles apply across many workplaces and in government, too ‚Äî where uniforms are not intended to only signify publicly a place of work but instead form social bonds through clothing, which are intimate factors of ordinary life. In Vekllei, clothes are not an expression of personality, but items to communicate and bond with, regulated not by an authority demanding strict conformity but a desire for identity, physicality, infrastructure and convenience.</p>
<p>Such a state of affairs is unimaginable in some countries, especially beyond collectivist or conformist cultures. Individualist intuition suggests that uniforms are actively detrimental to personal expression ‚Äî but this idea demands a scale of expression far beyond the preference for subtlety and delicateness in Upen. Deviations from uniformity, like earrings, the way hair is worn, wristwatches, makeup and minor irregularities accentuate the value of those things, and make them more important. This aesthetic contrast is at the heart of the wider Upen intuition that you can see in architecture and political priority alike. And, as any Vekllei boy will tell you ‚Äî seeing a classroom crush out of uniform for the first time is a religious experience, and only afforded by scarcity.</p>
<p>Vekllei is an individualist society, modelled after self-concern and self-love by a salt-of-the-earth and larrikin people of my native Australia. This is not a people compatible with conventional thinking on the regulation of appearance ‚Äî but, as with many things in Vekllei, both are held true at the same time. They are a free and unrestrained population clothed at work and in school in clothes gifted to them.
As an addendum, although many readers find common ancestry with Japan in this project (not unreasonably, either), Vekllei has more in common in some ways with the distant neighbours of my Australian homeland ‚Äî countries that haven‚Äôt been glamorised in the West through culture export. Thailand, Cambodia and Laos are among them ‚Äî coincidentally, all three are rare examples of countries where university students wear uniforms.</p>
<p>Someday, we‚Äôll look at the aesthetics of power and authority-worship, inspired at least in part by the history and culture of these countries, and associate them with cultural forces in Vekllei. If you have any questions, just ask.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I‚Äôm Hobart. I‚Äôve been working on this project for a while now. It doesn‚Äôt really have a purpose or an end goal ‚Äî I just want to draw and write about nice things, and I‚Äôm learning a lot on the way.
Welcome to everyone new here. I don‚Äôt really have anything to sell, I‚Äôd just like to thank you for tuning in and checking Vekllei out.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve drawn Tzipora here as a sort of Sailor Moon knock-off. Good show that. The Japanese intro is very nostalgic, I‚Äôd love to do a little animated short in that style.</p>
<p>I post about twice a week. I do a bit of everything ‚Äî machines, maps, characters, landscapes, architecture, etc. I‚Äôm truly a master of none.</p>
<p>You can come join the Discord if you‚Äôd like ‚Äî it‚Äôs just a quiet community to share interests and talk: discord.gg/dCE6vSU</p>
<p>Otherwise, I‚Äôll keep doing what I‚Äôm doing and you can keep liking my stuff (please). If you have any questions about the project, or just want to introduce yourselves, here‚Äôs a good place to do it!
Thank you kindly to all commenters, readers and friends of the project, whether you‚Äôve been here for years or for six hours ‚Äî it‚Äôs very special to have so many people interested in work that‚Äôs so close to my heart.</p>
<p>Keep on keeping on,</p>

<p>There were plumes in the sky, sent from bunkers buried deep in the well of the Earth, killing with switches. Vekllei went to war, and so Tzipora went to war with it.</p>
<p>The throbbing machinery of another world began turning, and anyone who saw the bomb would hear it. Passing seconds dislocated and caught heartbeats. The plumes were pretty. It was such a shame, those plumes. It was a quiet afternoon in the flower-tundras.</p>
<p>There was an absolute quiet among the grasses, and peace in her heart. She had work to do. She was a warden, after all ‚Äî and she‚Äôd done a good job spotting the missile before the sirens caught up. In truth, any devastation seemed incomprehensible. The flower-tundra would last forever. But that was her job, and she had to do it.</p>
<p>She left her bucket by the freshwater creek, intending to retrieve it a while later. The drinking water tasted better up here. She turned from the plume and followed the moss path out of the flower-tundra. Her village was before her.</p>
<p>So ended the old ways and so started the new.</p>

<p><strong>The concept of living forever</strong> jumps out at people uncomfortable with their own existence. There is a contemplative instinct among educated people that ‚Äî if they could simply will themselves into a state of self-actualisation ‚Äî death would only be an obstacle to greatness.</p>
<p>As Tzipora found out quickly, the opposite was true ‚Äî death and temporality  were wells of meaning against which all great people, beauty, and human constructions were cast.</p>
<p>Tzipora Desmoisnes is what is known as a Gregori Baby, a catch-all term for a unique genetic condition that has seemingly produced a variety of miracle children appropriate for the frothing futurism of the atomic age ‚Äî boys and girls who, suspended in the purity and good-naturedness of childhood ‚Äî live forever.</p>
<p>There is no single ‚ÄúGregori Baby‚Äù ‚Äî each is unique, and Tzipora is the 13th to have been recognised overall. The phrase is a shortening of Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome, a stand-in for medical information that isn‚Äôt there. The first, Gregori Hordiyenko, was born in 2024. He was healthy, and died of unrelated causes in his 20s. Tzipora, at 13th, continues to live to this day and is the oldest person on Earth.</p>
<p>There is a disturbing trend among the Gregori children, first heralded as miracles and symptoms of the space age, to deteriorate medically as more are born. The culprit is the malfunctioning of telomeres in their DNA ‚Äî the source of their longevity ‚Äî which regularly produce devastating chromosomal disorders, including Trisomy 13 &amp; 18, killing most ‚Äúageless children‚Äù before their third birthday. Those that survive are often victims of a severe anaphylaxis caused by a hyperactive immune system ‚Äî rendering many of them permanently sickly. Others find themselves unageing, but continue to grow ‚Äî reaching as tall as 2.5m before their bodies give out from exhaustion and osteoporosis.</p>
<p>So what is Gregori syndrome? What does your average (healthy) Gregori baby look like? Their genetic miracle is linked to the structures of the body that activate at puberty, and so girls vary between 11-16 years of age at onset depending on many factors that affect their development. Boys tend to be a little younger, from 8-14. Between the two, girls tend to be more stable, and all but two of the supercentenarian Gregori children are female.</p>
<p>Among girls, they are prepubescent and generally stop ageing on the eve of menarche, or their first period. In Tzipora‚Äôs case, her body is estimated to be 13 years and 11 months old. Unlike many Gregori children, Tzipora lives in a wealthy country and has volunteered for extensive research into her genetic makeup, meaning that much of early medical documentation around Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome was received directly from her case.</p>
<p>Most obvious is that, at a foundational level, her cells are similar in function to unipotent stem cells, and have been since hormones at the end of thelarche suspended her ageing. This change has occurred somewhere in her DNA ‚Äî exactly where is unknown ‚Äî but the end result is that, unlike regular progenitor cells that make up most adult bodies, the building blocks of her body are capable of cell-renewal. Her telomeres, the endcaps of chromosomal DNA in mammals, are undamaged. And so there is an amazing shift in her basic human structure ‚Äî in which human cell lineage, which usually ends in a mature cell incapable of division, is caught and rearranged. With this considered, it is no wonder that Gregori children suffer from such catastrophic chromosomal instability, and why healthy ageless babies are a rarity. Her body is not exactly a ‚Äúbody of stem cells,‚Äù but for their function in a healthy Gregori child, they might as well be.</p>
<p>So it is that nothing about Tzipora is changing. She suffers from pains in her legs often ‚Äî called growing pains, although they are not from growing ‚Äî and her cells continue to replenish, albeit at a rate 1.25 times that of normal people. She is, in essence, ‚Äúgrowing‚Äù as any other premenarchal girl would, but she is not getting bigger or becoming older.</p>
<p>Tzipora is blessed with an adult life in Vekllei, where the ‚ÄúChild‚Äù does not exist as it does in the West, and her individual freedoms are far-ranging. She may smoke, and drink, and has held many different jobs in her life. She holds two doctorates in English and Vekllei Literature. She is obviously sterile ‚Äî even if she were to somehow ‚Äúage out‚Äù of prepubescence into pubescence and receive the required hormones, she simply lacks the genetic code to reproduce ‚Äî but raises many children through her active participation in village life and her roles as Montre-Lola‚Äôs municipal and school librarian.</p>
<p>In other countries, with coded roles for children, their problems are much greater. Unable to form adult relationships and often incapable of finding work, many work in entertainment or fall into poverty as they outlive their friends and parents. Socially ostracised and forever young, many are victims of superstition and fear. As the pattern of Gregori children indicates an increase in mortality, even as more are born, their appearance is both a miracle and a tragedy ‚Äî ageing not through mitosis but through weathering the societies in which they live.</p>

  The Epoch of Rest
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-epoch-of-rest">#</a>
</h2>
<p>We‚Äôve spent a lot of time in the 21st century ‚Äî but Tzipora is biologically immortal. Where does she go from here? Well, let‚Äôs enjoy a small glimpse at that future together, by winding the clock forward one thousand years.</p>
<p>By 3076, our Solar System is a pleasant place to be. Most of the planets we once gazed at from afar are now habitable and lived on. The Great Epoch of Rest has begun.</p>
<p>There is no great interstellar empire, no rise and fall of spacefaring supernations ‚Äî a Vekllei way of life is now lived out in multicultural, prosperous clusters of people across our Solar System. The ordinary person is afforded incredible freedoms previously reserved for science fiction through the accessibility of personal light spacecraft, translated literally as ‚Äúboats‚Äù.</p>
<p>This here is the M-7000 APRICOT, manufactured by the Government Aerospace Factories (GAF) of Vekllei. Many companies are contracted by the GAF, including General Reactor S.A., to whom this boat lends most of its flight control systems and all of its power plant. It is a light, personal boat for women built in 2807, making it relatively unique in both its 28th century design language and its gendered marketing. While the personal boat market was growing rapidly by this time, the vast majority of owners and pilots were men. The APRICOT set out to change that, and Tzipora, the world‚Äôs oldest living person with a youthful face, was among the first to demonstrate the accessibility and freedoms of space travel for women and girls in the personal boat market. It was her first boat, and despite its orientation for women it was christened with a male name: BARON.</p>
<p>It is a comfortable and pleasant craft that can be lived in for extended periods of time. Tzipora has done just that, travelling to stars in search of water-planets with Micronesian archipelagos, where she likes to spend most of her time. Its glass roof across the entire accessible cabin, including bubbled cockpit, gives it breathtaking visibility in the depths of space and the most scenic of planets alike. Like almost all spacecraft, it is unarmed, save for the pacifying ‚Äújazz‚Äù electric canon, named for its firing sound reminiscent of a double bass strum.</p>
<p>When she tires of being alone, she returns to her hometown of Montre-Lola in Vekllei frequently. Boats are usually parked at off-world stations, preserving the aerospace and quiet of the Solar System.</p>
<p>Light speed is exceeded through superluminal travel. So-called black boxes require extraordinarily precise programming, since superluminal travel is in all ways but name time travel, and the universe does not tolerate time travel. Coordinates calculated in the universal pyramid system by a pyramid computer ensure that a vessel arrives when it arrives, so to speak. The alternative is going nowhere at all ‚Äî there is no in-between.</p>
<p>Superluminal systems are affected by gravity, so any person looking to exceed the speed of light and subsequently visit other stars must take the highways beyond our home system‚Äôs planetary orbit and launch into so-called free-travel from there. There are only a handful of these highways ‚Äî the solar system is very, very large, and human construction is very, very small.</p>
<p>There was an instinct among many people that human progress would naturally scale exponentially ‚Äî these were extrapolated from the remarkable progress in the lifetime of Tzipora‚Äôs parents and grandparents, who saw canvas aircraft in their childhood advance to the landing of a man on the moon, and again in her own exaggerated lifetime, in which the provinciality of her youth has simultaneously seen an expansion and exploitation of the planets in our native solar system.</p>
<p>This curve of progress was not to be, however ‚Äî and it also explains why we had such trouble meeting aliens in the first place. Part of it was simply that there are very few worlds with water that also formed earthlike landmasses nearby ‚Äî there are many aliens, and Tzipora has seen many herself, but most of them are fish and fish-adjacent. The second is that, if there is civilised life out there, it has most probably encountered the same engineering truths that humanity did, in our great interstellar project of the last thousand years. Namely that, all accounted for, there is no use for wasteful megastructures when a small one will do. People are having less children ‚Äî on Mars, Mercury and Neptune, the population is actually shrinking. What good is the so-called ‚Äúocean liner of the stars,‚Äù with a capacity of millions? There are around 12 billion people across the solar system today. Maybe another 8 billion in the Ala system. Maybe a few millions more who have simply given up society for scattered stars in our neighbourhood.</p>
<p>It is likely that if any other civilised races exist, they are simply of our scale, or have destroyed themselves completely in the reckless pursuit of expansion. Humanity is lucky not to count themselves among them.</p>
<p>The APRICOT is one of many models produced by Vekllei‚Äôs Government Aerospace Factories. It is now possible for the ordinary person to explore distant stars for themselves, granting freedoms unimaginable in a previous age. Such is life in the Great Epoch of Rest.</p>

<p>There are a lot of things Tzipora does differently to everybody else, and they start to make a lot more sense when you realise Tzipora either does not <em>realise</em> she is unusual, or does not <em>care</em>.</p>
<p>She has a lot of endearing characteristics that give great character to her mannerisms and physicality. She has a small overbite that makes her look a little froggy, and ritually pulls on her shirt and wipes her nose in anxious conversation. She is round-headed and cuts her hair herself. She talks in a low, expressive voice. She has been poorly socialised in childhood, and is afraid of casual conversation with people she does not know. She is keenly socially attuned and feels awkwardness painfully.</p>
<p>She wears the same clothes two or three days in a row. The outfits themselves are variations of the same thing, and her tastes don‚Äôt change. Everything hangs off her ‚Äî she likes baggy, airy clothing, and upsizes to accomodate. She doesn‚Äôt like fashionable or voguish people, whom she regards as decadent and offensive. To Tzipora, taste is timeless and bound to the soul. In her case, this fact has held true ‚Äî she has dressed the same as childhood, and very little else has changed about her in that time.</p>
<p>She is paranoid and conservative, good-natured and austere, with a moral outlook bound by her deepest anxieties and obsessions. She is deeply spiritual and material, fascinated with objects and their history. She has many collections of many things she‚Äôs found. She‚Äôll likely die a Catholic, but has a confrontational relationship with God and no longer attends mass, as a declaration of humanism. She does not know if this has pissed Him off, but it‚Äôs working out so far. Maybe that‚Äôs why He made her a homosexual ‚Äî to get back at her. He must have a good sense of humour, if that‚Äôs the case.</p>
<p>Tzipora may be intense and inward-facing, but she can also be disarmingly charming and self-deprecating. She has a good sense of humour. There are not many girls that can so easily reconcile the contradictions between the peculiar and the healthy, the eccentric and the friendly, and the violent and the domestic. That‚Äôs part of her character ‚Äî an essence of being that radiates decency, good taste and a respect for the spirit of all things.</p>

<p>The Azores had been a possession of Vekllei since 2002, when they were leased from Portugal indefinitely. The lease was defunct by the time of Vekllei‚Äôs independence from U.K. occupation in 2015, and the new state took formal ownership over the small Atlantic islands.</p>
<p>The Azores was Vekllei‚Äôs resort region, often called simply the ‚Äúholiday isles‚Äù. Brief reprieves from the North Atlantic cold were granted to hundreds of thousands domestic tourists each year in resorts and holiday rentals alike. Tzipora spent the summer of 2079 there. Good memories were made in that summer. She did not much like the beach but she liked the ocean. If she could retire, it would be in the Azores.</p>

<p>The puffin scouts set up camp not far from the rest, just outside of <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/krafla/">Krafla</a> in the Lava region. When they moved south tomorrow, thick native grasses and trees would give way to flower-tundras and bare hills, and by Tuesday they‚Äôd be in the heart of Lava ‚Äî empty and extraterrestrial and volcanic.</p>
<p>The Krafla high-energy communications tower was visible from all over the region. It provided uninterrupted radio to most of North Lava, and could relay signals through satellites. In another country, it might have been considered a blight on a pristine view ‚Äî but in Vekllei, there was no such thing as pristine. It was as much a part of the landscape as the trees.</p>
<p>They started the fire first, figuring they‚Äôd have more enthusiasm for the tent when they were warm. Warm sunrays played on the field-grasses around them.</p>

<p><strong>Like a lot of girls of poverty</strong>, Tzipora was very possessive of her things. No food was ever left on her plate. There was a deep anxiety that whatever wasn‚Äôt claimed would be lost.</p>
<p>She was also naturally obsessive and material-oriented, keenly aware of the importance of objects measured by metrics in her own silly head. You can discover a lot about a person from their trinkets and toys ‚Äî let‚Äôs discover a bit about Tzipora.</p>
<ul>
<li>Her handbag is manufactured by Spaa S.p.A., a design firm in the capital. They‚Äôre a luxury item in the international market but readily available in Vekllei, since few other handbag makers operate on the scale of Spaa. Ayn picked it out shortly after Tzipora‚Äôs arrival for its colour, after Tzipora told her she did not own any red things.</li>
<li>Tzipora has a sweet tooth. Especially for soda, which she calls ‚Äúfizzy drink‚Äù. On her person at any time, she carries a flavoured beverage from one of several brands capable of meeting her discerning tastes. She supplements them with a water bottle, since not even fizzy drink refreshes as well as water after phys-ed or a hot day. She also stocks her arsenal of snacks with good fruit picked off trees that overhang footpaths, as well as devastating salvos of Vekllei‚Äôs finest confectionary, including Fruit Tingles and chocolate pearls. Other girls in her class bemoan her childish metabolism as she drinks soda for lunch while they watch the scales.</li>
<li>The nostalgic whimsy of the sweets is tempered by two or three loose cigarettes that float around in her purse at any given time. She‚Äôs not a regular smoker, but she‚Äôs prone to attacks related to stress, and nothing helps as much as a drag. She carries matches, for not much reason other than that‚Äôs what Baron uses, and Tzipora is notoriously sentimental.</li>
<li>Tzipora has a rock collection that sits on her bedroom sill, and her recent additions sit at the bottom of her purse. She‚Äôs not a rock elitist; quartz from footpaths catches her attention as easily as igneous treasures like palagonite. Her favourite is obsidian.</li>
<li>She carries a small collection of useful books, including a contemporary paperback and a notebook. The paperback is for recess and lunch; the notebook is for language notes and phone numbers. Her Vekllei I.D. papers, which are both a passport and a reference booklet of key information and services, are carried on her at all times. It‚Äôs not really necessary in day-to-day life ‚Äî but who knows when it might be, and Tzipora won‚Äôt be the one patting her pockets at the airport gate.</li>
<li>Finally, there are a few accessories sitting in the bag. Tzipora made a ring for Cobian in metalworking class, but Cobian is on a school trip to France at the moment and Tzipora is waiting for her return. She has a wristwatch given to her by Baron, which she wears sometimes depending on the occasion. Other items are more precautionary ‚Äî a scarf for the wind, a handkerchief for sneezing, and a spare pair of socks for when she visits Cobian‚Äôs house or if she needs to double up in cold weather. As summer turns to autumn, she also carries gloves and a beanie.</li>
</ul>
<p>With everything in its place, her handbag is her anchor in the world outside her small second-floor apartment. The decommodification of society has only intensified the social value of objects, and they remain as important as ever in the life of the ordinary Vekllei person.</p>

</h2>
<p><em>This post is about the economy of Vekllei. It&rsquo;s a bit of a long one. If you have any questions, just ask.</em></p>
<h4 id="overview-of-the-bureau-system">
  Overview of the Bureau System
  <a class="anchor" href="#overview-of-the-bureau-system">#</a>
</h4>
<p><strong>There are many thousands of companies busy with work in Vekllei</strong>. The vast majority of these companies are single-person shops (S.p.A., or <em>senrouiva pettetie anaproiouya</em>). Also common are wobbly shops, or co-operative businesses (S.q.A., or <em>senrouiva qualitie anaproiouya</em>). The largest of the non-bureau companies are village factories (S.p.M., or <em>senrouiva persimonaya manufacturie</em>).</p>
<p>The bureau-level world is full of company mastheads that emphasise modernity, dynamism and progress. Vekllei‚Äôs ‚Äúprivate businesses‚Äù, however, tend to be local in taste. The vast majority of S.p.A. and S.q.A. businesses bear the family names of their founders ‚Äî Desmesyo S.p.A., Risyiouisnesn Home Machines S.q.A., etc. Their legal denominations are almost always affixed to the end of their nameplates.</p>
<p>Their <em>senrouiva</em> designation marks them as non-bureau businesses. A <em>bureau</em>, as a reminder, is simply the top-level organisation of a trade union that organises business in the country. In practice, it means that a company is responsible to the political organs of the country. Although independent from the government, bureau business is inextricably entwined in government concern and runs parallel to it.</p>
<p><em>Senrouvia</em> businesses are also part of the bureau structure, but are in practice not managed directly by them. They are usually united in local concern by so-called <em>petty bureaus</em>; small cooperative organs that safeguard local interest and business. These petty bureaus are often at odds with the bureau organs proper, and so even though they are part of the same structure, they are fundamentally political opposed.</p>
<p>So what is sort of business goes on in a bureau proper?</p>
<p>There are two common categories of so-called ‚Äúbureau firms‚Äù. You have state industries (S.A., or <em>societie indastrie</em>), which deal with manufacturing and exploitation of resources that require direct management by a public organ. You‚Äôll already be familiar with several ‚Äî General Reactor S.A., Comen Aeroyards S.A., Farmer‚Äôs Syndicate S.A. to name a few.</p>
<p>You also have state requisites (A.r., or <em>requoisesiasn amourisocietie</em>), which refer to the vast government-operated organs made up six categories primarily.</p>
<ol>
<li>Utilities (A.r.Un.)</li>
<li>Transport (A.r.R.)</li>
<li>Education (A.r.E.)</li>
<li>Local healthcare (A.r.F.)</li>
<li>Construction (A.r.Lo.)</li>
<li>Automation (A.r.M.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes ‚Äî education is not organised as a government department, but a bureau business. Other state responsibilities are folded directly into government departments ‚Äî war, intelligence, healthcare, police, fire, and the mint are all managed directly by the government.</p>
<h4 id="argument">
  Argument
  <a class="anchor" href="#argument">#</a>
</h4>
<p>With the legal division of enterprise laid out, let us examine again the four precepts of the Vekllei economic ideology.</p>
<ol>
<li>Self-management and self-interest through Sundress Municipalism.</li>
<li>Classification of property as an independent social organ, like nature.</li>
<li>Abolishment of currency and currency-substitutes. Participatory employment.</li>
<li>Economic feminisation.</li>
</ol>
<p>These four principles reveal a great deal about the character of the country, and stand largely at face value. There is an interest in chasing the promises of modernity while deconstructing its metaphysical constructions, through the abolishment of exchange-value, property and the overhaul of gender-economics. There are anarchist gestures in each principle, yet it is obvious that the product of these values complexify the conventional anarchist imagination. This is part of a series of contradictions ‚Äî between free and planned markets, between internationalism and provinciality, between man and woman, between freedom and security.</p>
<h4 id="austerity">
  Austerity
  <a class="anchor" href="#austerity">#</a>
</h4>
<p>The bureau system is plagued by inefficiencies, arising from logistic systems premised on warehousing, poor Coasean bargaining between petty bureaus and proper bureaus, a political emphasis on macroeconomic outcomes, a decoupling of aggregate demand and national economic output, cultural intolerance for Pareto inefficiencies, etc.</p>
<p>Luxury goods often vary in both supply and access, and economies are often severely localised to the point of provincialism, meaning that Vekllei has failed to transition reliably to a modern consumer society. The inhabitants of the Montre borough most often eat seafood because speciality meats, especially authentic red meat, are scarce. The opposite is true in <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/yana">Yana</a>. Clothes are repaired and regifted, appliances are available only from regional outlets usually located in the same city as the factory, and culture and diet are fiercely regional.</p>
<p>This is, in part, a result of unflinching national austerity and the sublimation of artificial markets prompted by Vekllei‚Äôs gold-based auxiliary currency, which necessitates meeting debt obligations for its strength internationally. There is a belief in Vekllei that the wealth of the country allowed the abolition of the currency ‚Äî in fact, the opposite is true. The abolition of currency allows a permanent wealth that compensates for the inefficiencies of the bureau system. The bureau firms do not pay their workers ‚Äî on paper, there are no expenses for anything beyond raw commodity exchange. This is how Vekllei‚Äôs largest companies ‚Äî and, per the bureau system, its government ‚Äî remain solvent.</p>
<p><em>Austerity</em> is a cultural force, too ‚Äî the scarcity of luxury goods inflates their social value, where comforts and necessities are largely abundant in automation. It creates an unimportant hardship that keeps Vekllei people forward-facing, lean, and ambitious. To acquire Picco S.p.A.‚Äôs iconic lounge chairs, you have to travel to their outlet in Horn, hundreds of kilometres from the capital area. There is no motivation for a craftsman to meet demand ‚Äî there is no petty consumption, either. To own a Picco chair means you have understood its cultural value, utility and craftsmanship, and have made the effort to find and transport one to your home. Inconvenience, and by extension, austerity, is celebrated as a ‚Äútrial of ownership.‚Äù Objects are very important in Vekllei, and craftsmanship is highly valued, and so people like to surround themselves with hand-made, sublime things wrought not just by the labour of the artisan, but their own effort to acquire it.</p>
<p>Petty <em>austerity</em> instills a national sentiment that tells the ordinary Vekllei person they are hardier than the ordinary American or European, even if the wealth of the ordinary Vekllei person is much greater than that of the ordinary American or European.</p>
<h4 id="apathy">
  Apathy
  <a class="anchor" href="#apathy">#</a>
</h4>
<p>Despite a vast, loosely organised private market in the <em>senrouiva</em> categorisation, Vekllei does not reward entrepreneurial ambition. Ambitious people are funnelled into positions of power in bureau firms and political office, but the founding of S.p.As and S.q.As is rarely motivated by a desire for influence or power. Indeed, artisanal S.p.As are often incapable of the sort of economies of scale needed for expansion. Vekllei instead relies on a sort of economic <em>apathy</em>, in which aggregate demand and productivity are spurned for immediate interest and pleasure.</p>
<p>This ensures that</p>
<ul>
<li>luxury products remain creative, personal works per Upen‚Äôs insistence on the symbiosis of labour and product</li>
<li>the private senrouiva market is not capable of threatening the provincialism of Sundress Municipalism, which might make a commodity universally accessible and threaten to introduce generic consumer society into Vekllei life</li>
<li>the private senrouiva market under petty bureau organisation does not threaten the organised de facto monopolies of the bureau companies</li>
</ul>
<p>If Vekllei has replaced the commodity with the object, then it is through economic apathy that they have ensured objects will never again become commodities. Just as the ordinary Vekllei person is apolitical, so too are they apathetic towards change in their purchasing habits, favouring small, inconvenient and personal brands over those exploiting aggregate demand. In a sense, this also contributed to the popular Vekllei term <em>product atheism</em>, in which the metaphysics of products are dismantled and rearranged into social forms.</p>
<p>In this sense, the <em>apathy</em> is found on both ends ‚Äî within the <em>senrouiva</em> business owner, who is provided little upward mobility to satisfy ambition beyond local and regional expansion, and within the consumer, who recognises products only within cultural and social dimensions. Neither is conducive to a functioning, fair market on an interregional scale.</p>
<h4 id="play">
  Play
  <a class="anchor" href="#play">#</a>
</h4>
<p><em>Play</em> is the foundational motivation of most work in Vekllei. There are existential motivators, too ‚Äî a desire to wield power, or professional legacy ‚Äî but in many professions it is <em>play</em> by which a Vekllei person justifies labour. It is also why work is fiercely protected by petty bureaus and other labour organisations ‚Äî work is their connection to wider society, and that connection is held sacred in Upen.</p>
<p>It is through work as <em>play</em> that Vekllei is able to justify the employment of children. Financial motivations for work have all but disappeared ‚Äî in its place, the workplace has to convince people to work. There are few state protections for businesses unable to maintain a workforce, either ‚Äî it is one of the most common reasons for the shuttering of a company. The boss must convince his workers to stay, and so a total inversion of power has occurred.</p>
<p>In place of money, there is prestige, and in prestige there is myth. Few people have genuine interest in Fordism. Many more are attracted to the hand-crafted furniture of Picco S.p.A., and becoming recognised as a builder of great things. In a sense, a person ‚Äúacts out‚Äù the role of a craftsman, in the same way a person ‚Äúacts out‚Äù the role of a police officer, or ‚Äúacts out‚Äù life as a pilot.</p>
<p>In this system, the childish spirit of recreation, duty and ‚Äúthe adult world‚Äù is acted out by millions of Vekllei people each day. Seeds planted by a child play-acting as a farmer continue to grow, and so too does the Vekllei economy feed its population through the intersection of fantasy and labour. At this point it is obvious that <em>play</em> is not fantasy at all, but in fact a motivation for labour as genuine as profit. Where it falls short, in hard, disempowering jobs, it is automated and conscripted through the mandatory service system. As it is often described:</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe <em>Bureau System</em> is labour-intensive where wanted, alleviated by industrial machinery where preferred, and automated where necessary.‚Äù</p>
<p>In its wake are states of <em>play</em>, and through play comes a decent framework for living, obvious in the basic satisfaction of the Vekllei people.</p>

<p><strong>What is Vekllei?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hi, I‚Äôm Hobart and I write and draw Vekllei</strong> at Studio MillMint.</p>
<p>This is a pretty complex project. Not just complex insofar as there‚Äôs a lot to read about it, but that it uses concepts and terminology you might not be familiar with if this is your first time around utopian fiction.</p>
<p>So Vekllei is a utopia ‚Äî what does this mean? It‚Äôs latin for ‚Äúno place,‚Äù and I use that literally. Vekllei, in a literal sense, cannot exist. Not because I think it could never have existed, or that some part of it is completely unreasonable, or it breaks the laws of physics ‚Äî but because it exists in a certain place and time that is just isn‚Äôt replicable. It‚Äôs all built from the ground up.</p>
<p>Vekllei is a very good place to live, <strong>but it is not perfect</strong>. Utopia does not mean ‚Äúperfect place‚Äù. Utopia is a form of social dreaming, much like worldbuilding, linked to the values and priorities of its author. In utopian studies, ‚Äúutopia‚Äù is usually broken down further:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eutopia</strong> ‚Äî ‚Äúgood place‚Äù</li>
<li><strong>Dystopia</strong> ‚Äî ‚Äúbad place‚Äù</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that both form a part of the ‚Äúutopia‚Äù ‚Äî this is appropriate, since Vekllei is grounded in a social realism that acknowledges the good and bad parts of life. Indeed, they are inseparable ‚Äî you cannot have the light without the dark. Obviously, in my eyes, Vekllei is very much a eutopia.
You can read more about Vekllei (the country) by clicking here.</p>
<p>There are three parts to my ‚Äúsocial dreaming‚Äù:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Landscape</strong> ‚Äî the world and country of Vekllei. When you think of ‚Äúutopia,‚Äù this is it ‚Äî shining modernist cities against striking landscapes.</li>
<li><strong>Character</strong> ‚Äî not all social dreaming takes place in spaces. Some of it is built around experiences, objects and relationships. Tzipora is a ‚Äúcharacter utopia‚Äù in the sense that she represents a utopian life experience, full of stories good and bad.</li>
<li><strong>Author</strong> ‚Äî Vekllei is a representation of the problems of my life, as a form of escapism. A lot of my posts here reflect dissatisfactions and displacements in my own life ‚Äî consumer society, commodification of childhood, wage labour, postmodernism, etc. I‚Äôm very much a part of this utopian dialectic.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Let‚Äôs run through some of the common queries and misunderstandings about Vekllei</strong></p>
<p>Who are you?
<em>A Tasmanian illustrator.</em></p>
<p>You‚Äôre not Japanese?
<em>„ÅäÂâç„ÅØ„ÇÇ„ÅÜÊ≠ª„Çì„Åß„ÅÑ„Çã</em></p>
<p>Why is Vekllei a utopia?
<em>It makes me feel better about my life and the world. It‚Äôs escapism; it‚Äôs a dream.</em></p>
<p>It‚Äôs a bit cringe to grandstand your political beliefs, doncha think?
<em>Vekllei is a personal utopia. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm selling. At least you‚Äôre getting good opinions.</em></p>
<p>Where‚Äôs the tension if it‚Äôs perfect?
<em>Vekllei is very cynical and tragic in places. Utopia is just a reflection of the author, good and bad.</em></p>
<p>Is there a novel? A story? A comic?
<em>I‚Äôm working on a comic right now. I‚Äôm pretty much working on Vekllei full-time so I‚Äôm hoping to announce it soon. I‚Äôve got a lot of different Vekllei projects going.</em></p>
<p>Where is Vekllei?
<em>Iceland.</em></p>
<p>Why does Vekllei look Japanese?
<em>Vekllei is like a country of Scandinavians speaking French with an Aussie accent in Sh≈çwa era Japan/Maoist China/Taiwan etc. Vekllei looks however I imagine utopia looks.</em></p>
<p>How does that make sense?
<em>Why can‚Äôt it just be cool?</em></p>
<p>Is your alt-history thought out?
<em>Vekllei‚Äôs history is whatever I need it to be. I‚Äôm always trying to be realistic, but it‚Äôs all worked backwards from the setting. I‚Äôm not really ‚Äúworldbuilding‚Äù in a typical sense. Very little of it is published, most of it is retrieved on request. Just ask if you have questions.</em></p>
<p>Is Vekllei communist?
<em>No.</em></p>
<p>But Vekllei calls itself ‚Äúpetticoat socialist‚Äù.
<em>Vekllei is set in a culture of Marxist revivalism in the 50s and 60s. A lot of Vekllei‚Äôs lexicon is set in that context. Vekllei is a decentralised democracy that doesn‚Äôt use money. It‚Äôs a sort of participatory economy.</em></p>
<p>Why the &ldquo;petticoat&rdquo;?
<em>Vekllei is a female country. Womanhood is decommodified. It&rsquo;s maternal, social and friendly where socialist rhetoric is masculine, technocratic and progressive.</em></p>
<p>Who is Zelda?
<em>Zelda is another name for Tzipora. She has two names specifically to confuse you.</em></p>
<p>What is the ‚Äúbulletin‚Äù?
<em>I publish the Atlantic Bulletin once a month via email. It‚Äôs got the month‚Äôs posts in it as well as facts and tidbits from Vekllei. DM me an email if you want to join.</em></p>

<p><strong>Vekllei, legendarily, does not use circulate currency</strong>. Goods and services are moved and offered arbitrarily, provided amply in abundance. Anything that is not abundant is manufactured and distributed directly under the control of a bureau, which is a trade organ responsible to the affairs of the country. At no point do coins or paper currency change hands in the day-to-day affairs of the country.</p>
<p>In this sense, Vekllei is usually described as ‚Äúmoneyless‚Äù ‚Äî yet it does in fact have a currency. The Vekllei Kroner, or ‚ÄúCrown,‚Äù is hundreds of years old, and Vekllei still operates a mint for currency. At any time, a Vekllei person can write to the National Mint and order a set of coins, like the ones pictured above. So what is going on here?</p>
<p>Although the Kroner has not been used since 2022, after the last village in Stochi returned coinage to the Mint, it continues to exist to this day as a gold-backed currency in the International Market, through which Vekllei trades with other countries. The physical coins, produced mostly as a novelty in the tradition of <em>mayaesdiou</em> (medallions, or small metal pieces commonly collected and given in Vekllei), are a physical coinage of the International Market. The coins also operate as a form of bullion, or wealth reserve, since each coin is worth exactly its face value in gold. Since the International Market is completely closed and independent of the domestic economy, its value is controlled directly by the so-called Government Bank. It is one of the few gold-backed currencies in a developed nation today.</p>
<p>To further complicate things, there are actually two different Kroner in Vekllei. There is the <strong>Vekllei Kroner</strong>, which represents the International Market, but there is also a seperate <strong>Government/State Kroner</strong>, which is not minted and used only as an investment mechanism, backed by government &ldquo;white bonds&rdquo; which are usually measures of labour-hours or refined materials. It is, in a sense, a fiat currency alongside a gold-backed currency.</p>
<p>They exist independently because they are used for two seperate purposes. The Vekllei Kroner is used a wealth reserve and bullion, and also represents the collective wealth of the Vekllei people. Each citizen, in theory, is entitled to an equal share of the Government Bank, although it can only be withdrawn as currency in specific circumstances. Vekllei also holds substantial amounts of foreign currency in the Government Bank and Vekllei Kroner, which is used to invest and stabilise holdings and capital in foreign countries. The Government Kroner, on the other hand, is used as an investment mechanism abroad, usually in support of infrastructure. It is also used to acquire foreign currencies through investment in foreign capital.</p>
<p>Despite having two currencies, neither the &ldquo;Vekllei Crown&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Government Crown&rdquo; are used in the domestic economy in Vekllei, which is autonomous and not subject to a central bank. So it is that Vekllei‚Äôs currency is both little more than a novelty and essential to the function of the country in a world still ruled by money.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In the coinage depicted above ‚Äî 8 coins are minted in Vekllei today.</strong> They were designed in 2015, in the year of independence. They represent eight core values in the country.</p>
<p>The ‚Äúsmall crowns,‚Äù worth 1VK and 10VK respectively, represent fraternity and liberty, two founding elements of the Vekllei constitution. The 50VK coin is plated in silver and has a small ruby inset. Rubies are used to represent energy, in this case, the vitality of the spirits, which dominate Upen and the Vekllei landscape. The 100, 200, 500 and 1,000VK coins represent different landscapes of the country. As a volcanic island nation, the ocean (100) and landscape (200) coins are fairly straightforward. The humanity coin (500) represents the Vekllei people and ancestry ‚Äî note how humans are placed alongside other natural forces. The flower coin (1,000VK) represents the flowers of the country, which are important spiritually and have formed part of the Vekllei identity. Vekllei has the most flowers per capita in the world. The final, larger 10,000VK coin represents the previous seven together, as a total sum of Vekllei landscape and identity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To answer Tzipora‚Äôs question ‚Äî a bottle of fizzy drink cost about 2VK in the waning days of coinage in the early 2020s.</p>

<p><strong>When Tzipora first laid eyes on Ayn</strong>, hours after her arrival in the country, she thought, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the most beautiful woman I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äù</p>
<p>It wasn‚Äôt just her features or figure that captured Tzipora‚Äôs attention ‚Äî it was also her confident, inconspicuous movements and a quiet self-assuredness that seemed obvious in her gentle expression and posture. Tzipora was not quite sure how to describe it. Her beauty was very alive in the way she inhabited a space, as she walked into the hotel lounge to meet them. Maybe it was grace ‚Äî maybe it was a little girl-crush ‚Äî she didn‚Äôt know.</p>
<p>As Baron greeted her and they exchanged cheek kisses, it appeared to Tzipora that Ayn and Baron were old friends, and she was further assured in her respect for him ‚Äî that Baron could know such beautiful women seemed natural! Baron was capable of anything in Tzipora‚Äôs eyes, a figure of ultimate power ‚Äî it only made sense that he knew this woman!</p>
<p>Of course, both Ayn and Baron were mortal, and Tzipora got to know them well during the helter-skelter weeks following her arrival in Vekllei. Baron might have rescued her, but it was Ayn who introduced her to Vekllei, as AB/NI called Baron into office for the first time in a decade. It was Ayn who took her clothes shopping and wrestled with Zelda‚Äôs obsessive-compulsive fabric requirements. It was Ayn who taught Tzipora her first Vekllei sentence. And in the end, it was Ayn who convinced Baron that he had to take responsibility for Tzipora.</p>
<p>It was only years later that Tzipora began to realise that Ayn and Baron were, in a sense, married to each other through their work. They worked closely (he as recent head of operations at AB/NI, she as a research analyst in American economics) and their friendship went back decades. She was his ‚Äúwork wife,‚Äù which was the closest Baron could ever get to that particular institution, and so her proximity and love towards Tzipora made her a mother.</p>
<p>She was a vision of everything Tzipora wanted for herself ‚Äî to be capable and respected; beautiful and unassuming; intelligent and productive. And once more, it was Ayn, in the end, who convinced Tzipora that she could these things for herself, regardless of her genetic disability. ‚ÄúGo out there,‚Äù is what she said, ‚Äúand trust in yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>Atlantic Salmon was the best in the world, and Vekllei had a lot of it. Ocean-going fishing boats brought their haul to Ro, where they cruised wide postwar canals and unloaded tonnes of shiny, bright salmon into processing plants. If a new factory was built, so too was a canal or a railroad. Nothing was trucked. Fish was traded fresh in markets or turned into emulsifiers and fertiliser.</p>
<p>The canals were worked heavily, and few fishing vessels were incorporated. The vast majority of Vekllei‚Äôs fishing fleet was owned by the people that worked them, trading with the Sea Office. From a <em>quaisiosn</em> or ‚Äúcanal park‚Äù you might see a dozen vessels in an hour. Some were run-down prewar things limping out to the shallow coasts, while others were nuclear-powered salmon trawlers designed for the storms of the Atlantic. On the northern coast, the bigger boats were reinforced as ice-breakers. Fish was one of the few meats in the Vekllei diet that wasn‚Äôt grown in an industrial laboratory, a fact reflected in the scale of its infrastructure.</p>
<p>Canals are good for a city, and are good for the heart. Tzipora would take long walks in the morning along the Wellington Canal to where it met Touismah, then follow it to where it circled back into Lola. She would figure out what she was doing with her life as the boats departed for the day‚Äôs catch. She never much liked salmon, but she liked the boats. They were an island country, and their futures and pasts met in the sea ‚Äî where it churned and swelled in their dreams.</p>

<p><strong>In an unprecedented event,</strong> during Vekllei‚Äôs 50th Sea Festival since Independence in 2065, an 8 kiloton fission bomb was sunk to a depth of 150 meters and detonated at midday. It was an incredible sight on a day so clear you could see the gentle curve of the earth where it met the horizon. A flash of light and a spray dome surged outwards into the quiet Atlantic, which was broken apart by plumes that formed a column of water that climbed high into the sky. The lateral plumes, the ‚Äúmushroom‚Äù, reached far across the horizon, forming thick clouds that would begin to rain into the sea.  From the coast, fifteen kilometres away, a warm light bathed observers and was followed a moment later by a bang that deeply shook you and those around you. In this instance it seemed that the whole universe was their domain.</p>
<p>The plume would rise nearly 1,500 metres into the sky before falling away. It stayed that way for a while. Almost nobody moved for a long time after ‚Äî people stood on cars and tables. You could only recognise the scale and the feeling of the fission bomb by seeing it in person.</p>
<p>It seemed incomprehensible, in the face of such a device, that wars could still be fought at all. What use is a battleship in the face of a cloud like that?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tzipora and Elise, covering the detonation for Lola 7th School‚Äôs student newspaper, found themselves not quite sure what to say. Elise wrote, captioning Tziproa‚Äôs photograph, ‚ÄúThe Independence bomb filled our sky with our sea for a half-hour on Sunday, and with it rose the thoughts of every person in attendance, who considered the awesome power now shouldered by each of us.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was indeed some sense that they had contributed to the bomb, and that they had more at their disposal. Few would fly the planes to deliver them, and fewer still had the brains to develop them, but participating in a nuclear century contributed to, in some effect, a nuclear horizon.</p>

<p><strong>Tzipora had been ejected</strong> from the operations room once the guys arrived. She knew what was going down, anyway. No specifics. But you didn‚Äôt bring in uniformed soldiers for regular business. National Intelligence liked to work with their own people.</p>
<p>Five days prior, Baron hailed an EB/NI company car and it pulled up beside him. The electric passenger window slid down. Baron nodded at the passenger.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs in here. There‚Äôs more if you need it. I‚Äôd appreciate a call, I‚Äôm in my office all next week, okay?‚Äù He passed over a white postage envelope. ‚ÄúTake care.‚Äù</p>
<p>The British man opened the letter and read it twice as the car approached the <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/pharos/#vekllei-world-jetport">Vekllei World Jetport</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JULES WYNN IS YOUR 3RD MAN. ‚ÄúJEREMY‚Äù APPEARS IN ARCHIVES 2046 ‚Äî ALMOST CERTAINLY WYNN. NEARLY 20 YEARS. NOTES TO USSR THRU CYPHER CLERK (UNKNOWN). RECALLED TO MOSCOW ‚Äî GREAT SUSPICION OF HIM FROM CONTROLLER DOWSETT-CLARK (OXFORD). THIS IS GOOD INFO FROM PARIS ASSET. WYNN WILL DIE IN RUSSIA. GET HIM AND ANOTHER RING SURFACES. CIA KNOWS WHERE BUT NOT WHO. DO US BOTH A FAVOUR.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tzipora went for a walk to clear her head. She had a lot going on in her life ‚Äî though she was sure it seemed small compared to whatever was going on in the operations room.</p>
<p>It began to rain an hour into the walk. She‚Äôd left her umbrella with the rest of her things in Baron&rsquo;s office. That was okay. She didn‚Äôt mind the shower, anyway ‚Äî it was mid-summer, and the rain was warm. What a novelty that was, at 60 degrees north. This was weather from the sunny Azores, pulled north by the wind currents over the Atlantic. Within minutes her skirt was heavy and her camisole was showing at the shoulders. She blinked heavy streams of water out of her eyes.</p>
<p>She passed the soldiers on their way out as she returned to AB/NI reception. A friendly receptionist had cloaked her in a towel by the time Baron had found her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúDid you have a good meeting?‚Äù She asked.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSure,‚Äù and characteristically, he considered that a satisfactory answer. He pulled the towel off her head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre completely soaked.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter. Are you with those guys? About that other guy?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWatch it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúKeep that talk past security. But I‚Äôm going to fly out tomorrow. I‚Äôll be back in the evening.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo cooking for me, then. Where are you going? Or can‚Äôt you say?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúEngland.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Tzipora said, forming a gun with her fingers. ‚ÄúLike James Bond.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her life was a nexus of various global ambitions, it seemed ‚Äî imagined only through the dreamy lens of a teen-ager too small for the world‚Äôs problems.</p>

<p>There was not much to say about this, between the two of them. Tzipora looked at Cobian and pulled a froggy smile that tried to express that it was nobody‚Äôs fault.

<p><strong>When I paint Vekllei, I usually depict the warmer months</strong>. Hems are shorter, days are longer, and the destabilisation of the world‚Äôs climate has only benefited these arctic people. At the gift end of the Vekllei low pressure system, Scandinavian misery has become Mediterranean pleasure, with warm summers and a mild Autumn and Spring.</p>
<p>Still, by late October, the the earth is hard with cold and the days are short. The world may be warmer, but Vekllei‚Äôs polar latitude is unchanged, and in the depths of winter the sun only rises for an hour a day. These are Vekllei‚Äôs ‚Äúmoon months‚Äù, and they announce some of the most important spiritual festivals in Upen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although school hours are reduced in winter, life carries on and Vekllei fashion becomes traditionally utilitarian. Tzipora has poor circulation and cold hands even in the warm months, and by November she‚Äôs traded the skirt and gi for traditional <em>rouisha</em> trousers and a cloak. <em>Rouisha</em>, like a lot of traditional clothing, have origins in agriculture and are characterised by a loose, baggy fit and insulated lining. Cobian is wearing a heavy wool sack-type dress, which is worn like an apron over other clothing. Winter brings forth ‚Äúpetticoat society‚Äù literally. Note the leather <em>plate</em> on her shoulder, to which her <em>christmas aiguillette</em> is attached.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this sense, Winter‚Äôs revival of traditional clothing and customs further evidences its practice as the most traditional season of the year. Although the warm calendar flourishes with the futurist sympathies of a modernist Vekllei, not even the atomic age has been able to dispense with its hard-worked pragmatism developed in a millennia of bitter cold.</p>

<p><strong>Baron had inherited the apartment</strong> from his uncle, who passed in the year following his parents. It was in a mixed residential-industrial neighbourhood, adjacent to a canvas factory. Out back was a rivulet, which roared in the long rainstorms of early April.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each January, the Colour Bureau of the Architecture Assembly announces the year‚Äôs colours, and tradition in mainstream architecture and interior design is to incorporate the announced palettes, which usually contain a hundred or so colours. His uncle‚Äôs apartment had been built and furnished in 2031, and so it had a #2031 Colour Profile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In some ways, it was a very conventional apartment in the Vekllei tradition. It had a sauna and bath in the wetroom, a bidet, a sunken living room and a bread oven. In others, it was more peculiar. The apartment was bizarrely allocated across three levels. You alighted the entrance light well into a sunken living space, then climbed back up into the kitchen. The main living room and master bedroom were another step above the kitchen. Adjacent to the main living area was a closet and study, which overlooked the entrance from a half-meter mezzanine.</p>
<p>It was in this study that Tzipora set up shop when she arrived in March 2063. Baron had been reluctant to take her even provisionally, not least because it would mean searching for a new apartment in his busy return period after being abroad for ten years. Tzipora, however, had lived in a dormitory for much of her life and had settled in the alcove once she acquired a dresser screen. She refused outright the master bedroom, which sparked a sleepy agoraphobia. By the time Baron had made other accomodations, Tzipora had entrenched herself in the neighbourhood and had developed a severe sentimentality about the apartment and its rivulet, and so that was where he lived for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>In this sense, Tzipora had a strange kinship with the apartment. Baron sealed himself off in the master bedroom each night, but she never left the main living space. It was warm in there, especially in the flickering light of the enormous oven and fireplace, and when she moved the screen aside in the morning her little corner became part of the living area.</p>
<p>She had a lot of good memories of that apartment.</p>

<p>As a way of thanking my Patrons, I‚Äôm taking some time over the next two weeks or so to create a little set of Tzipora postcards and send them out as gifts.</p>
<p><strong>How many cards will the set contain?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôm aiming for about six cards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>How much money would you need to have forked over to get some?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think about $20 over your pledge lifetime would cover print and shipping, though I‚Äôll let you know if that goes up or down. I‚Äôm hoping to cover shipping, so you‚Äôll just need to supply an address.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What if I haven‚Äôt yet pledged enough?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you‚Äôre a Patron who hasn‚Äôt yet pledged the $20 or whatever it is to cover print and shipping, just contact me and I‚Äôll make‚Ä¶ alternative arrangements for you. Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî if you want the cards, you won‚Äôt miss out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Who would even want these?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>People who like cute 6x4‚Äù illustrations on nice card stock will like them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs a good time to plug my Patreon if you‚Äôve got some government stimulus bux floating around ‚Äî <a href="https://www.patreon.com/vekllei">link here</a>. It produces enormous pressure for me to create new work and art, so if you‚Äôre a fan of what I do it‚Äôs a good way to position yourself as an investor and get on my ass about posting more.</p>
<p>Speaking of posts, there‚Äôs one coming tomorrow or the day after.</p>
<p>Thanks always, and best wishes.</p>

<p>After three days in Ada, Tzipora set off towards Mt Miya. She made good time, and after three hours had happened upon the shoulders of the bright Volouisnesnkull Glacier. It was about here that she heard a morbid industrial siren, echoing up the valleys from far away.</p>
<p>At first she thought it might have come from Ada, since Boya Chemical had a large plant there, but as she lay out her things for lunch she heard the distinct whine of a turbojet. It grew louder, and deeper, until a National Fire VTOL tanker roared across the sky, swirling powdered snow on nearby peaks as it arced across the glacier. It was close enough to catch the sun ablaze in the reflection of its glass nosecone.</p>
<p>She later learned that lava streams had opened up not far from where she‚Äôd hiked, and had been making their way towards a geothermal power plant nestled in the highlands. In the evening, on her way back, she saw a long line of fire supertankers and pumpers spraying water in beautiful arcs, where it caught hisses from bright streams of melted rock. It was a common enough sight in Vekllei ‚Äî hoses were the only defence you could reasonably make against the the fracturing earth.</p>
<p>Still, it was not often you saw jets flying so low. It was funny to her that even the barren glaciers were tamed in this age.</p>

<p><strong>East of Montre, West of Tjornes, waits a rare sight among Vekllei‚Äôs hard igneous slopes</strong> ‚Äî a crown of gentle sedimentary cliffs packed with ruddy sandstone, which melt glacially into the sea chasing blue-sky bergs.</p>
<p>Tzipora was, at the time, making her way on foot from Montre-Lola to Ada, which was a coastal town in the North-East known for its luxurious health spas. Tzipora was not much interested in health, but she was interested in walking, and she made a pilgrimage along the coast every few years to make sense of the world. She was going whichaway and destined for nowhere in particular. Tzipora was very much Baron‚Äôs daughter, in the end.</p>
<p>She had stopped to see the Red Cliffs forty kilometres out from Tjornes when she saw a cruiser of the constabulary parked unusually by the shore. The constabulary were not local police ‚Äî they were a national outfit tasked with policing government and ‚Äúbureau business‚Äù. You found them at power plants, outside universities, guarding the prime minister and providing bodies for HO/NI (Home Office at National Intelligence) when they needed doors kicked.</p>
<p>Tzipora was not the sort of girl to be intimidated by a badge, and she wandered innocently to the shore where she found the cruiser empty. She looked across a beach of black sand and saw some sort of operation playing out ‚Äî there was a gun boat not too far from the shore, and a police hydrofoil beached on the sand. She counted maybe a dozen officers. She wondered if they‚Äôd arrest her if she walked down to see what was happening. She climbed onto the hood of the cruiser to get a better look. Perhaps it was immigrants ‚Äî or smugglers.</p>
<p>It only took another moment to spot the smashed crates broken across the rocks before she knew what was going on. She was witnessing the dying days of the countercultural decade, and its chemical fuel was now smashed open before her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 2070s were a wild time for the so-called ‚Äúpink years‚Äù in Vekllei, and for the first time in Tzipora‚Äôs memory she started seeing ‚Äúpleasure drugs‚Äù on the streets. There had always been plenty of sin carrying on in Vekllei, even in her early days ‚Äî hallucinogenics, alcohol, and synthesised highs were legal and easy. But you didn‚Äôt see much of the exotic stuff, which grew in a better climate. Hash, coke, H ‚Äî it was all underground stuff for personal use. These drugs were listed among many others in the class-A import prohibition orders, which made them hard to find and illegal to import. These were ‚Äúpleasure drugs‚Äù ‚Äî the Vekllei phrase for overseas narcotics that didn‚Äôt have a place in Upen or a preexisting cultural history. Comparatively, they were just ‚Äòfor pleasure‚Äô.</p>
<p>H for heroin was a big news item for a long time, and with it you had one the largest moral panics in modern Vekllei cultural memory. Crackdowns came soon after. Tzipora found it difficult to describe the feeling of the time. It was a new generation ‚Äî one she didn‚Äôt belong to, despite her appearance ‚Äî and she didn‚Äôt have much sympathy for hedonists. They might tell her different, but she never thought the pink years were about much more than feeling good all of the time. She wondered if she was growing old and grumpy inside.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She wondered how the crates had got there. Had the coast guard sunk another smugger? You heard about the navy firing shots in the news sometimes.</p>
<p>Ruined with seawater and picked over by constables, the chemical feast of Vekllei‚Äôs pink years died with the times. Tzipora wouldn‚Äôt miss it.</p>
<p>She stepped off the hood and set off back towards the road, where a warm inn and hot food awaited her.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>According to her friends</strong>, Tzipora‚Äôs contemporary afflictions were tragic.  Her medical problems; her violent childhood; her sensitivity and melancholy ‚Äî you could feel sorry for her, because a lot of her problems were not her fault. She invoked sympathy.</p>
<p>Tzipora never considered herself particularly tragic. It seemed straightforward, if difficult; she continued to live ‚Äî and so she lived. Tzipora&rsquo;s sympathy was instead reserved for her first and closest friend: Cobian.</p>
<p>Cobian was not well-liked at school, and it did not take long for Tzipora to find out why. She had a childish edge for a sixteen-year-old, and bitterly hated losing. She was not good at school or sports, was not particularly charming, and came across as desperately lonely. She was a quiet misandrist, which would have been fine if she could play the part of a self-assured social matriarch, but her mother‚Äôs despotic conservatism struck out that possibility early on. Such is life.</p>
<p>And because her world was predicated on being liked and living a normal life, her psyche prohibited self-reflection. That was the great difference between Cobian and Tzipora. They may both have been young and neurotic, but Tzipora‚Äôs relentless self-interrogation left great space for personal growth. Cobian was instead trapped in a domestic play-fantasy, in which she could live out a mythical high-school life, and shattering that illusion would collapse her whole reason for being.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tzipora recalled visiting Cobian‚Äôs home for the first time. Cobian‚Äôs mother asked Tzipora to remove her shoes and socks and wash her feet before going to play inside. By the time Tzipora found Cobian in her room, the girl had already changed and handed over her uniform to be laundered. Tzipora, in her tomboyish indigence, had never encountered such a brutally hygienic regime.</p>
<p>Cobian was a different girl at home. Her anxiety and neurosis washed out a little, and her confidence was propped up by the routines her mother had set out for her since she was a child. There was a friendly, curious girl buried under a decade of loneliness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tzipora wondered what Cobian thought about lying in bed at night, and why the girl worried so much about things that didn‚Äôt matter. And it was precisely in the smallness of those things and the tremendous anxiety Cobian owed toward them that made Tzipora want to hug her. To be so worked up over something so pathetic was startlingly moving. The idea that the girl had deluded herself into a corner of hopelessness seemed sad ‚Äî and the fact that no one would reasonably care about such a feeble, meaningless, self-inflicted state of affairs made it tragic.</p>
<p>Through Tzipora‚Äôs friendship and the world it opened up for her, some of Cobian‚Äôs edges were sanded down. Some of it was a late maturity ‚Äî some of it was Tzipora‚Äôs dismantling of the scaffolding the girl‚Äôs mother had shoved in there. With that effort, and obvious love, Cobian‚Äôs reason for being changed too. One day, in Tzipora‚Äôs presence, it didn‚Äôt seem so important to be liked by everybody anymore.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/spectre.jpg"/> <p><strong>The Americas Bureau at National Intelligence</strong> (AB/NI), a semiautonomous organ of the covert operations council of the War Department, is recognised as the busiest of the continental bureaus. There is a lot to be busy with ‚Äî the Dallas Secession, the Brazilian invasion of Bolivia, the Dallas nuclear lend-lease, and the reliability of Venezuelan oil production are all of some concern to Vekllei, and so AB/NI proactively has fingers in those pies.</p>
<p>AB/NI foreign operations are provocative and direct, often guiding or outright employing shadow contractors, criminals, mercenary groups and political action groups. This is in the spirit of Vekllei‚Äôs concentric security concerns, which are benefited by the destabilisation of major powers.</p>
<p>Frequently implicated and rarely rarely held accountable, AB/NI soaks up hard men returning from the previous decade of vicious fighting in Asia and puts them to work in coat and tie as servants of the Vekllei intelligence community. These include superficially respectable, decent men like Baron Desmoisnes, but also many of those whose violent tendencies and undiagnosed psychological problems are kept isolated from domestic life by their disposal in the regional bureuas.</p>
<p>Tzipora first met <strong>Wihle ‚ÄúWilly‚Äù Tesmehsnoisen</strong> in Baron‚Äôs orbit shortly after her arrival in Vekllei in 2063. She immediately liked him. His filthy ragged hair and stache were at odds with his business attire, and his short, sharp movements carried a threat of violence. His incongruity radiated freakish charm and power ‚Äî the sort of person Tzipora liked. He thought Tzipora was the funniest thing he‚Äôd ever seen, and not just for her good sense of humour. To him, her diagnosis wasn‚Äôt worth much more than a good laugh. ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt changed a bit,‚Äù he‚Äôd say every time he saw her. She liked that. He also faked an American accent.</p>
<p>He worked as an operative at AB/NI, and she only saw him occasionally. As far as she could tell, he was not particularly close with Baron ‚Äî Baron was not particularly close with anyone but her and maybe Ayn ‚Äî but she thought Wihle respected him. They‚Äôd both been boys in the Asian war, and he‚Äôd clearly had a place in Baron‚Äôs history, no doubt in shadowy work to which Tzipora was not privy. When Tzipora performed in the school play as Witch #2, Wihle was in the audience with Baron and Ayn, clapping and stomping his feet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúWhere he‚Äôs from?‚Äù She asked Baron.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe said he‚Äôs from California, but that‚Äôs a lie. I don‚Äôt know where he comes from.‚Äù Like most of their conversations in his office, he was looking at his work and did not look up to answer her questions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCalifornia,‚Äù she said, and something about it ‚Äî the spirit, if not the truth ‚Äî made sense. She asked, ‚Äúwhat does he do at work?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúShit all,‚Äù Baron said, and that was the end of that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2072, Wihle was killed in an altercation with his wife. The unsolved disappearances of several Americans went with him.</p>
<p>Willy‚Äôs loud anarchism was contrasted by <strong>Jiro Kond≈ç‚Äôs</strong> obsequious professionalism. Here, lo, was another AB/NI contradiction ‚Äî a man dressed like a gangster with the disposition of a well-paid civil servant. Jiro had started out as a merchant navy sailor on old diesel ships in the Sino Crisis, and after the war had found work with Vekllei‚Äôs Japanese Embassy as a double agent. Soon he‚Äôd been granted citizenship and recognised as a capable regional advisor for OB/NI (Oriental Bureau at National Intelligence) and met Baron through Vekllei‚Äôs work monitoring U.S.-Japan relations.</p>
<p>Although many Vekllei staff in the provincial HO/NI (Home Office at National Intelligence) dismissed him as an unremarkable ‚Äúimport‚Äù from the East ‚Äî a pretentious Japanese bureaucrat ‚Äî Jiro was a fascinating character. Generally, men who‚Äôd actually seen action were unremarkable and gentle like Baron, or easy-going and irreverent like Wihle, but Jiro was neither. He was a very intense, focused man who volunteered almost any information about himself freely, though he was not a conversationalist. Baron shrugged decades of his life away in the most innocent of questions, but a simple ‚Äúdid you ever kill somebody?‚Äù elicited a frank, disarming admission from Jiro:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶ In 2056. A Korean‚Ä¶ He was monitoring a man of interest to me‚Ä¶ and the man in question was in a very delicate situation. I shot the Korean in his apartment. This was in Osaka.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was not a warm man, but he remembered every occasion of her life and delivered small gifts. Tzipora loved gifts, the the care of the gesture in a decommodifiied society, and so she reciprocated the gesture to him several times a year. So it was that Jiro‚Äôs birthday gifts consisted only of the scarves knitted by the daughter of his boss. He never married,</p>
<p>There were others at AB/NI whom Tzipora liked, not least of which the fabulous and loving Ayn, but few typified the eccentricity and violence associated with the regional bureaus more than Wihle and Jiro. It was a glimpse of the ‚Äúreal‚Äù world. Away from her Vekllei language lessons, and the superficiality of her classmates, were the spectres of real danger, mental illness and genuine intrigue. That connection, as tenuous and unjustifiable as it was, was very important to her.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/lakehouse.jpg"/> <p><strong>By 2047, Vekllei had a lot of broken men</strong>. Tens of thousands had alighted troop ships at the end of the War of Taiwan, only to find that pieces of their lives had unravelled overseas. Hardy, bronze-skinned boys were left with their ghosts, and those ghosts introduced them to drinking, and brawling, and suicide.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As part of the Birmingham Convention and the second round of the Commonwealth War Trials, a young and recently defeated Vekllei nation was chained to a conflict that was beginning to fester in East Asia. They didn‚Äôt want to be there, but that‚Äôs what happens when you lose a war. So they became &ldquo;Whites&rdquo; ‚Äî as opposed to &ldquo;reds&rdquo;, or communists, they supposed. But it was also apparent that they were anglos in an oriental war. They fought begrudgingly alongside the Taiwanese, American GIs, Brits, and some Australians. At one point there were more white foreigners in the Datong district in Taipei than Chinese ‚Äî that‚Äôs modern war, Baron supposed.</p>
<p>He was not a friend of any People‚Äôs Republic, but the Kuomintang wankers were off the rails. The high schools had closed down and they‚Äôd taken the boys and put them in uniform. They sent those boys south from their provisional headquarters in Wulai, down as far as Yuchi where they rounded up the smartest-looking people and shot them. In the Five Days Terror, Taipei glowed in the light of a hundred thousand books turned to ash in bonfires. They were spotting Mao on street corners.</p>
<p>Behind any KMT officer there was a Joint Intelligence Bureau slug, and behind the slug was some CIA motherfucker. Vekllei soldiers, who were ostensibly nonaligned but were in no position to argue, took orders from these clowns.</p>
<p>The People‚Äôs Republic had control over a decent part of Kaohsiung and the whites were terrified of rumours of Red Chinese in the mountains on the West Coast. The communists did not have the benefit of a century of support from the Americans, and most of the boys they killed were ill-equipped and skinny. At night you could hear the distant booms of gunfire in the sea between the ROC and Xiamen. At this time Atomic shit was still restricted to naval warfare. Occasionally an old diesel ship would go up, and you‚Äôd see it from the shore. Those fireballs looked like they touched satellites overhead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Baron had a clinical, empty side to him in which he stored a lot of his pain. He had done unspeakable things, and had merely forgotten them or parcelled them away so that they could not be coherently retrieved. That sort of conscience lands you with spooks; for the rest of the boys coming home from Taiwan, their lives had ended with the war.</p>
<p>The problem of dead vets and criminal heroes became such that the War Bureau, equipped with new research on shell-shock, established a series of hospitals across the country that isolated and gave time for these boys to come to terms with what they did and what they saw. They were sanatoriums, in a sense ‚Äî you took a train into the highlands, and you came back when you were ready. A lot of boys found it difficult to be around people who didn‚Äôt understand them. At the hospitals, called <em>ouismaindesdenyo</em> or ‚ÄúCare Homes‚Äù, they could be around those people.</p>
<p>Baron would visit people occasionally at the <em>Yana</em> <em>ouismaindesdenya.</em> Tzipora would go with him. She thought it was because her being there made him feel less like a patient. She did not know if the people he visited were comrades, friends or if he was simply fulfilling a duty as an ex-officer. He never made it clear to her. She spent time on the lake shore painting and thinking. At dusk the sky would glow, and she would think about what the hell it was she was doing with her life.</p>
<p>In some ways, she was a patient at <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/yana">Yana</a> too ‚Äî after all, like these men, she‚Äôd done and seen terrible things. She‚Äôd seen the other side of life‚Äôs coin, in a way. When she underwent <em>sumoirnesdenen</em> (ego death) years later, she thought it felt similar to that moderated, clinical idea of trauma ‚Äî like she had crossed a rubicon, and had been exposed to some secret about violence and death, and that every part of her life was now framed in relation to it.</p>
<p>She never claimed to be like the boys at Yana, because she wasn‚Äôt. But she knew what it was like to enter domesticity and never feel at home in it. She was lucky; she had Baron. She wondered about those boys who married before they left. She wondered where those brides were now.</p>
<p>After a week, they would travel downstream from the highlands and leave Yana behind. There the memories would stay, until their return the following season.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/learning.jpg"/> <p>The Montre Prefecture of the Vekllei city-state is among the most learned urban landscapes in the world. In the days of the monarchy, it had been an unremarkable city, home to the empire‚Äôs submarine fleet. It was obliterated by bombs in the war, and the &ldquo;new Montre&rdquo; that has blossomed in its place is nourished by its ashes.</p>
<p>Among the most prolific creatures in Vekllei‚Äôs academic elite, including prestigious folk like physicist Thomas Weihennet and Chief Engineer of General Reactor Maya Ou, almost all of them were educated in Montre. It is home to Vekllei National University, and also to the more bohemian Montre School of Economics.</p>
<p>It isn‚Äôt the ivy or sandstone that makes Montre remarkable, however. Montre‚Äôs status at the forefront of learning is found amidst the dozens of small unorthodox, nonconformist, radical and avant-garde schools that have proliferated in Petticoat Society. Any chump can wiggle his way into Vekllei National University ‚Äî but only twelve students a year can study under renowned architect Urian Reddennen, who teaches ‚ÄúSick Newda‚Äù architectural ideology to talented young architects as young as fourteen.</p>
<p>Tzipora herself has a brief encounter with the <em>uoismendainda</em>, or ‚Äúunderground schools‚Äù. While working anonymously as central mailer of <em>Kid Comix</em>, an underground APA (amateur press association, a sort of decentralised magazine created and possessed only by contributors), she made contact with Sgt. Salt, AKA cartoonist Darren Heidoismen. It was only years later that he discovered that editor ‚ÄúSquick‚Äù was Tzipora Desmoisnes ‚Äî none other than Vekllei‚Äôs first Gregori Baby. After meeting her in Montre-Lola, her quiet provincial lifestyle in stark contrast with his fame as a comics author, she agreed to work for him at his studio in Montre, mostly as a colourist for serialised strips.</p>
<p>Her apprenticeship only lasted six months, and she wouldn‚Äôt return to comics after her stint in the biz, but she kept in close contact with both Heidoismen and her own roots in the underground comix scene.</p>
<p>It is in these schools, taught by auteurs against curriculums of fancy, that much of Vekllei‚Äôs cultural fabric is woven today. It is not particularly sentimental ‚Äî in fact, it is ruthlessly modern, facing deindustrialisation as the liberation of artist and worker alike. Uoismendainda are the spirit of Vekllei‚Äôs postwar resurgence, and their concentration in Montre makes the prefecture a clear choice for youth looking for answers in the world.</p>

Another stroke on the Hell Screen
She washed ashore
Two dollars were in the sand
A hound had come here to rest
Damp cotton touched green water
She thought of what she was doing here
Of what the night invoked
Hot sand met a rising wind
It happened again
She realised
There was not a single dog left to fight

<p>The Beach was a small part of herself.</p>

<p>Among the whitecap constellations</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Sumoirnesdenen</em> or ‚Äúfacing self abolishment‚Äù is better described as ego death. It has a long history in Upen, Vekllei‚Äôs nondenominational animism, which employs hallucinogenic drugs in service of spiritual revitalisation.</p>
<p>The aim of sumoirnesdenen is not to better prepare a mind for a sincere spiritual pursuit, but to propel the psyche into an objective, disassociated space to clarify the pressures and deceptions in life. It is in a sense a psychological and spiritual rebirth, if performed with an experienced guide in a controlled environment.</p>
<p>Tzipora Desmoisnes, Vekllei‚Äôs first Gregori Baby, engaged in sumoirnesdenen in 2076 at the age of 29 against her father‚Äôs advice. She had concerns about having a ‚Äúbad trip‚Äù because of lingering psychological concerns, but decided to proceed after years of depression. She engaged in the trip with the help of an Upen minister, as is standard practice in Vekllei.</p>
<p>The practice is celebrated in two parts ‚Äî first, a period of ego-death under influence of mushrooms (although synthetic drugs are often used today, especially in urban areas), and second comes a sober reassessment of priority (called <em>maloidenen</em> or self-worship) that aims to rebuild the person positively while the memory of the open soul is still vivid. This is done largely through scripture and controlled socialising, and is celebrated, much like a birthday, as a milestone.</p>
<p>Although Tzipora‚Äôs sumoirnesdenen experience was positive and provided important clarity in a very lonely time of her life, she soon after began recalling dreams from her early months in Vekllei for the first time in a decade.</p>
<p>They were nasty-feeling images, encumbered with insecurities and a dark paranoia. Never a strong swimmer, she found herself washed up on beaches, meeting dead acquaintances, and grimacing as her waterlogged nightshirt chafed her shoulders. It began to disturb sleep. She wondered if sumoirnesdenen had exposed a clearer subconscious filled with a sinister, more accurate, depiction of her past and future.</p>
<p>It had, however, provided a clear frame of mind to understand herself in the context of the universe. The dreams began to fade. Her ego quickly reasserted her place in the world ‚Äî indeed, it had never really disappeared. It provided her with a glimpse at the other side of the coin, and it put her heart at peace.</p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m back after a break. I&rsquo;m relearning how to write worldbuilding posts. I hope you enjoyed, there&rsquo;s more on the way  &ndash; Hobart.</em></p>

<p>I post a lot of sketches to <a href="https://discord.gg/dCE6vSU">the Vekllei Discord</a>, which is something between a fan club and a social club for the project. Check the #utopia channel for little artworks like this one.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re paying me money to make posts, that&rsquo;s where you want to be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a few projects on the go at the moment:</p>
<ol>
<li>The website is still be developed, complete with a comprehensive wiki of all the latest canon. I stopped working on it for a while as I approached the limits of my HTML ability, but I&rsquo;ve enlisted someone smarter to help me.</li>
<li>The comic is making tentative progress but I hope to release some pages here eventually. It&rsquo;s a long-term project that needs to be started right &ndash; in the meantime, I can prepare as well as I can for it.</li>
<li>A Vekllei card game is well under way. 150/180 cards are sorted, and then it&rsquo;s all a matter of doing the art for them. It&rsquo;s going to be pretty great!</li>
</ol>
<p>A couple other things, like animation experiments, storyboards for a trailer, and so on are also burning in the background. I just hate to see so much time go between posts on this place :)</p>
<p>Otherwise, feel free to hang out here and keep on keeping on. I&rsquo;m on the upward trend out of a serious creative slump that&rsquo;s lasted the last three months, and it feels good to be working again. Let me know if you&rsquo;ve got any questions about&hellip; anything, or this picture specifically!</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>

This isn&rsquo;t really intentional. I&rsquo;m just an amateur artist who is still learning to draw.
That doesn&rsquo;t work so well in a comic with sequential panels, so I&rsquo;ve been working on standardising my characters. This is a concept panel for Cobian, Tzipora&rsquo;s longtime friend (and occasional girlfriend).]]>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t work so well in a comic with sequential panels, so I&rsquo;ve been working on standardising my characters. This is a concept panel for Cobian, Tzipora&rsquo;s longtime friend (and occasional girlfriend). She&rsquo;s an awkward, sympathetic sort of person, and often left out in my posts. She certainly doesn&rsquo;t deserve such treatment &ndash; she&rsquo;s one of the most interesting, complex people in the Vekllei cast and I hope to treat her with respect in future.</p>
<p>This panel is the first step.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on pages for the comic, but it&rsquo;s slow going. I post pages as they come to my patrons (more or less!) but it&rsquo;ll be a while before any chapters come together. That&rsquo;s okay. I work better that way.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/earthprincess.jpg"/> <p><em>Editor‚Äôs note ‚Äî it‚Äôs getting close to 4 a.m. and I‚Äôm not sure I can even remember why I wrote this post. Everything is a fog. Expect revisions and possibly major changes in the morning.</em></p>
<p>Pictured above is Tzipora Desmoisnes, the Princess of the Earth and one of the most interesting persons of the last century. She has made good use of her 126 years on Earth (and counting), and a few samples have been chosen for your viewing pleasure. Conveniently, captions have been attached to briefly describe a few choice (but not comprehensive) depictions of her life.</p>
<p><strong>2 Years Old / 2049</strong></p>
<p>An infant Tzipora arrives in a country she would remember as her homeland. Knowing the tumultuousness of her childhood from here on, it is sobering seeing the round baby&rsquo;s face staring back, red-faced and full-cheeked. Her mother, Mette Sumoisnesn from Vekllei, is a bohemian political scholar and radical looking to start fresh in South America after several life events leave her dissatisfied with life in Vekllei. With her savings secured, they move into a wealthy neighbourhood called Modelia, in Bogota.</p>
<p><strong>5 Years Old / 2052</strong></p>
<p>At five, Tzipora speaks Spanish natively and only a handful of Vekllei phrases like many immigrant children. A naturally lithe and timid girl, she won‚Äôt make friends at school until her second year. In many ways, she is already becoming a picture of opposites from her mother; where Mette is a postmodern lady of wide social interest, Tzipora is conservatively inward-facing. She has, however, already inherited Mette‚Äôs disarming honesty and decisive mindset.</p>
<p><strong>7 Years Old /2054</strong></p>
<p>As Mette kept irregular hours and a laissez faire attitude towards parenting, Tzipora is already fairly independent for her age. Although hardly the only child to maintain a household in Bogot√°, she is certainly unique in her social class. Mette‚Äôs Vekllei-sourced wealth goes a long way in Colombia, but her bohemian lifestyle and liberal social instincts lend to a world of contradictions and colourful schisms that leave Tzipora caught between worlds ‚Äî that of the poor, artistic, and revolutionary as well as the wealthy, polite and domestic. Even at this age, Tzipora already showcases several of these contrasts in her malleable personality, which are as charming as they are awkward. Although her relationship with Mette is untraditional for a single mother and daughter, it is affectionate and Tzipora is happy in Modelia.</p>
<p><strong>10 Years Old / 2057</strong></p>
<p>It‚Äôs 2057. President Cifuentes has been dead for six months, the communists are in power in Bogot√°, and Mette has depleted ten years of Colombian wages to shelter Tzipora in a Catholic boarding school in the U.S. to keep her safe from an imminent American invasion.</p>
<p>She now wears the uniform of St Mary&rsquo;s Catholic College in Sacramento, California. She&rsquo;s cut her hair in keeping with the American fashions and has lost some weight as she diets for what the other girls in her dorm call a ‚ÄúCoca Cola body‚Äù. On Tzipora‚Äôs small, girlish frame, her thinness looks pitiful and achingly neglected, not attractive. She is an Inuk-Scandinavian girl with Jewish European ancestry who knows only the language and culture of a wealthy Latina. Compounded with her little eccentricities and timidity, she does not fit in well at school.</p>
<p><strong>14 Years Old / 2061</strong></p>
<p>A lot can happen in four years. There was an atomic bomb in Cairo, and the Federal Government has lost control of the so-called Dallas States. Mette has stopped responding to letters and Tzipora‚Äôs out of money. She makes plans to move in with her male mathematics teacher, who predated on her near-idiotic numeracy weaknesses to foster an illicit relationship, but abandons that idea when she discovers he has been grooming multiple other girls.</p>
<p>She takes the California Zephyr to Utah instead of San Francisco on advice of a trusted priest, and quickly finds herself indigent and starving. Clothed by a charity in filthy artefacts of the previous decade, she lives in a women‚Äôs shelter that has too little to go around. There‚Äôs not even work as a strikebreaker anymore, since sporadic fighting in Southwest Utah has moved or shuttered all business that isn‚Äôt literally burrowed into the surrounding desert.</p>
<p><strong>16 Years Old / 2063</strong></p>
<p>She‚Äôs aware by now, and has been since her school days, that she has some sort of nutritional deficiency or hormone imbalance impeding her puberty. As a good Catholic girl of the faith, she does not understand anything about puberty, but it doesn‚Äôt take a doctor to figure out she looks half the age of the teen-agers in the shelter.</p>
<p>She has miraculously managed to find work as a maid at a nearby motel, and has money for little luxuries that now mean the world to her. Clean underwear, some sneakers that are good for day work, and a steady stream of penny dreadfuls from the local bookshop, operated by the mysterious ‚ÄúBaron‚Äù. She lives in a so-called ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs House‚Äù that starts attracting attention as the turbulent political climate in the Dallas States continues to destabilise.</p>
<p><strong>18 Years Old / 2065</strong></p>
<p>Tzipora celebrates her eighteenth birthday as a student at Lola 6th School in Vekllei. She is overwhelmed with affection for the country and her new father, Baron, but is struggling to reconcile her natural inadequacies as a new immigrant with her expectations of success in a country that offers her so much. Life is busy, and is full of new things that send her reeling with excitement ‚Äî friends, music, and good food are just a few. At once younger and older than her years, Tzipora‚Äôs independence and stubborn affection make raising her easy for first-time dad Baron, who never intended to have children, let alone start with a teen-ager.</p>
<p><strong>32 Years Old / 2079</strong></p>
<p>Suffering from a severe bout of seasonal depression and a deep sense of listlessness after graduating from university, Tzipora‚Äôs long-neglected existential epistemology breaks open all at once. Now a librarian in the Lola central library, she watches Baron get older and wonders about ending her life once he passes. She drowns her panic in her work, working days at a time cataloguing stock at the library while also editing the underground ‚Äòzine <em>Kid Comix</em>. The sardonic nihilism of the underground Comix community is her only comfort as she considers her future and the place in the world.</p>
<p><strong>86 Years Old / 2133</strong></p>
<p>Although Tzipora always evolved slowly, by 86 Tzipora‚Äôs turbulent youth is well behind her. Her little insecurities and aching sense of inferiority have blossomed into a gentle sense of humour and easygoing disposition common in old ladies. Does Tzipora qualify as one? By the numbers, certainly. But ask anyone in Montre-Lola, the village she‚Äôs lived in since moving there over fifty years earlier, and they‚Äôll tell you that she retains a teen-age vitality and curiosity in her that should have been dissipated long ago. Physically, she is, of course, unchanging ‚Äî and her spastic tics are as present as ever. Montre-Lola may change, and Tzipora may watch generations cycle through, but she is apparently timeless.</p>
<p><strong>126 Years Old / 2173</strong></p>
<p>Much older, and a little wiser, Tzipora has had decades to reconcile her extended stay on Earth with the seeming immortality of the Vekllei cultural landscape. She still lives in Montre-Lola as a maternal root of the community, and resides in the little house built for her by the town over eighty years ago. For Tzipora, her sense of time has slowed to a crawl. A creature of routine, life around her goes on despite it all ‚Äî the atomic war, the rebuilding, the stresses of a post-war world. A lot of her life is boring. She doesn‚Äôt mind. She finds great pleasure in the mundane, and her body is young and healthy. There are always reasons to live, and not just for the people in her life ‚Äî after all, novels continue to be written and her plants need to be watered. Absorbed in her pleasant little life, it barely occurs to her that next year she will become the oldest living human being in history.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/immortal.jpg"/> <p>Tzipora had never been taller than anyone in Vekllei at a meagre 5‚Äô2, but she was taller than Shizuku Kobayashi. Like Tzipora, Shizuku had not physically aged a day since she was a child.</p>
<p>It was summer, and six days after Tzipora had arrived in Japan as a Gregori ambassador from Vekllei. Although she would not be the oldest victim of Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome until Quentin Cook‚Äôs (USA) infamous murder-suicide ten years later, she was one of the so-called &ldquo;First Thirteen&rdquo; publicised patients, and so was somewhat known to the international community. By the time of their meeting in 2071, there had been an estimated 250 Gregori baby births, and around 130 living across the world. Kobayashi was the 122nd ageless child, and Japan‚Äôs first.</p>
<p>Tzipora met Kobayashi in the Ozake Ryokan outside Kamig≈çri, Kobayashi‚Äôs birthplace and home. It was not far from Aioi. Tzipora was 24 at the time, and Shizuku was 18, and still in school. Poor Zelda was so nervous about meeting another Gregori baby that she became overwhelmed by Japanese manners. So it was that Shizuku‚Äôs first introduction to Tzipora was via a clonk on the head.</p>
<p>Shizuku was sweet and even-tempered, and they talked for nearly five hours before she was retrieved by her mother in the late evening. She spoke okay English, because she‚Äôd dropped out of school for a year to pursue acting with an American film company based in Yokohama that operated through the NGHQ. Acting was a common profession for Gregori babies ‚Äî it seemed that the miracle children of the world were quickly relegated to freaks of entertainment. Tzipora did not have the stomach for it, but she knew of several others around the world who made good money playing children in film.</p>
<p>Tzipora excitedly relayed the awkwardness of life in Vekllei as an unageing child, from her problems at university to her dreams of the future. She had no metric for how it might differ in Japanese society, because in many ways she was still fourteen ‚Äî the problems of a young teen-age girl seemed universal, even then.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo one takes you seriously at first,‚Äù Tzipora said, but she acknowledged that once people got to know her she‚Äôd had no problem being treated with respect.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI suppose,‚Äù replied Shizuku.</p>
<p>Tzipora could not help but notice that Shizuku looked different from her Japanese peers. It was only later that she would learn that Shizuku‚Äôs father was a GI from Okinawa, shamefully rendering her eternally ‚Äú<em>hafu</em>‚Äù despite the miracle of her existence. She could sympathise, in her own privileged way ‚Äî Tzipora, too, was a girl of many ethnicities and cultures. But even with her television understanding of the land of the rising sun, Tzipora grasped that things might be more difficult here, where old-world memory collided with new-world growth.</p>
<p>Tzipora quieted her obnoxious enthusiasm and asked Shizuku what pictures she was in. Shizuku said she wasn‚Äôt in pictures, just television, and Tzipora wouldn‚Äôt have seen them anyway. Tzipora asked what she wanted to do. She said she didn‚Äôt know. As for Tzipora?</p>
<p>‚ÄúI want to work in a library,‚Äù Tzipora said. ‚ÄúI love stories, and I like the idea of being in charge of the books.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI love stories too,‚Äù Shizuku said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to write them, really. But we‚Äôll have to see. It‚Äôs difficult‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
<p>She trailed off, perhaps lost in her foreign vocabulary. She didn‚Äôt have to finish the point. It <em>was</em> difficult: it was difficult to make money, it was difficult to find love, and it was difficult to picture a future where the only constant was yourself. It was no wonder that Gregori children, whose personalities were often developed by the projections of those around them, ended up killing themselves when the uselessness and meaninglessness of their existence revealed itself.</p>
<p>Although Shizuku‚Äôs mother received money from the estranged father, and Shizuku herself had made good money through acting, a fugue settled on Tzipora in the days after their meeting. Previously she had not considered herself a ‚ÄúGregori baby;‚Äù she had considered herself merely ‚ÄúTzipora‚Äù. In Vekllei, that was an identity she could afford. But despite Shizuku‚Äôs outward satisfaction with her present state of affairs, Tzipora couldn‚Äôt help but feel ill thinking about the anxious, isolating existence that almost certainly awaited any girl whose childhood stretched into the decades. All at once it seemed very unfair in its quiet cruelty ‚Äî the hafu girl who would never grow up to be a beautiful actress.</p>
<p>Although she‚Äôd kept in contact with Shizuku Kobayashi, Tzipora would not visit another Gregori baby for many decades.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/carriage.jpg"/> <p>She‚Äôd accidentally starched her <em>gi</em> quarter-pleat in the wash. She held it self-consciously against her side as she watched the clouds navigate the sharp mountains that formed Montre‚Äôs deepest valleys. Even out here, where human presence was gentle and subservient to the land, Vekllei National Railways had tracks that serviced the smallest villages. Today it was high summer, and the slopes were green and free of ice. They waited in the shade of the regional limited express carriage for train 802, which would take them home to Montre-Lola and complete a two hour ritual all Montre-Lolan university students made for their studies.</p>
<p>802 was the second of an 800-series trainset that had been manufactured since 2003. These trains came from old society, long before Tzipora or her father had ever been born, back when VK Rail had been the Montre Regional Transport Company. It was crazy to think that the 802 had been around since before the bombs had fallen, and had survived the chaos of the atomic aftermath. It was funny how human creations became guides through history, linking young women like Tzipora to the solemn echoes of the past.</p>
<p>There was something sobering about that idea, she thought. She was thinking about this as she waited in the carriage, as a younger girl fidgeted in boredom and another whistled away in sleep. The sun was hot on the platform outside and the rising air distorted the bright yellow glint that signalled 802‚Äôs approach.</p>
<hr>
<p>Despite a week between posts, I‚Äôve been a busy little bee. I made a Tintin-style Tzipora today, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/VJSR4mn">please click here to see her</a>. I also drew Tzipora causing a <a href="https://imgur.com/a/hAkBZ1i">ruckus in a Ryokan here</a>.</p>
<p>I also encourage you all to come <a href="https://discord.gg/dCE6vSU">join the Vekllei Discord</a>, where I do a lot of sketching and a lot of nice worldbuilding discussion goes on. In the coming days I have a few projects I‚Äôd like to share, including a new animated studio title for this project!</p>
<p>These last few posts have been heavy on the melancholy and light on the worldbuilding. That‚Äôs all about to change.</p>
<p>See you soon.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/sublime.jpg"/> <p>When Tzipora moved to study English and Vekllei literature at the university of Montre in 2075, she had to walk from the little home where she lived to Montre-Lola‚Äôs old concrete platform, which facilitated a single electric railcar each way, each day. If she was feeling lively, she could make it to the platform in a half hour. On the days where she dreaded sighting her plimsolls in the shoebox, it might take forty-five minutes. She made this trip six days a week for five years, because that was the price of acquiring two degrees at once.</p>
<p>At first, the walk had been a welcome canvas of boredom. If the weather was good, it could even invoke the sublime. A row of gnarled old pines, planted by dead men, formed rank beside the dirt road. In the spring, the flower-tundras flashed colour through the waving pine needles as the breeze rolled through, which cooled her dreadful perspiration. She felt a very strong kinship with the Earth then, and she steadied the pace of her breaths, and she tasted sweet pine and warm soil in the air. She looked doll-like in her cape and dark leather shoes against the bright sunlight. After a long winter, her skin was not gently porcelain, but instead a waxen and tallowed complexion coloured only by the vigour of the honest walk and the spirit of the good earth around her.</p>
<p>Every day, she passed the same gnarled pines, and the same buried fallout shelter by Silverwater Creek, and the same abandoned machine shed that slumped closer to the fenceline with each passing season. It collapsed one day in March, baring its rusted mechanical organs briefly before it was buried in winter snow. She would look at the old tractor and wonder what part it had played in the lives of the stewards of these old fields. She thought about the factory where it might have been made and was struck with sadness.</p>
<p>After five years of walking in this timeless landscape, she no longer resented its obtrusion on her journey to school. She had memorised everything there was to memorise along her path. She recognised lichen on the old stair rail like moles on the face of a friend, and could recite the make and count of the wine bottles in the bed of the creek. It occurred to her, in some small way, that it was only after the beauty of the path had evaporated that she was able to truly visit it. It was the eternal conflict of landscape, she supposed; it was only now, in her utter boredom and total blindness to landscape, that she had finally removed herself from the vista and allowed herself to see place as it was for the first time.</p>
<p>She had intuitively discovered for herself a central tenant of Upen, where the sublime had been usurped by the much quieter, and much richer, mundane. The sublime screams like colour through pine leaves; the mundane is the dew that gathers silently on the spokes of the tractor ruin. The sublime is in the perfume of country air; the mundane is in the carcass of a beetle nestled in the moss; the sublime is the self-conscious rouge on her lips; the mundane a dirty scuff on her sock ankle; the sublime the whisper of the wind, betrayed by a new bud beneath a branch; the prism of her light blue eyes by the moistness around her nostrils in the cool weather.</p>
<p>No, it was never a matter of birth and decay, or light and dark; it was never about a schism to begin with. It was a fundamental kinship with a transcendental memory of place, and the hidden spirituality of the unimportant, and the sweetness of the unbeautiful.</p>
<p>The unconscious recognition became conscious knowledge, and it obliterated her world. The entire axis of cosmology tripped. The world pivoted. Beauty and pleasure were rediscovered in an instant. She looked around her, and she had discovered the mundane. She was no longer standing amidst landscape, but mere place.</p>
<p>Her heart swelled with pleasure. Her blood sounded in her ears. Through five years of emotional labour and millions of footfalls, she had discovered the mundane in the sublime, if only here. Her eyes and heart had a sudden clarity; she was filled with love not just for the smallest of things, but in fact the smallest things exclusively.</p>
<p>Although the feeling she had in that moment was by its nature irreproducible, she would do her best to recognise the mundane everywhere. She sincerely fell in love with <em>Newda</em> shortly after. The small and honest voice of the simple and inconsequential and imperfect called to her wherever she went, and from then on she was always at peace in place; for she was always surrounded by patina, and change, and the most delicate hinge of life that animated the inanimate in her renewed understanding of the world.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/dress.jpg"/> <p>Tzipora, illustrated here, is happy because her traditional dress makes her feel stylish and her cape is soft and warm.</p>
<p>Vekllei is an ancient culture with many inherited and vestigial artefacts. Nowhere is this more apparent than in her national dress, particularly that for women, where old and new collide as they do all across Vekllei. Pre-war, post-war and future are present here. Let‚Äôs run through some of the elements, which can be found throughout her society.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fountain hairpieces.</strong> These are the centrepieces of Vekllei ceremonial hairstyles, and are aided by sticks traditionally or more commonly gels today. These are only for women, and are arranged at the top of the head. Hats are not worn with traditional dress, and the Fountain hairpieces date back to the 12th century, in initial Danish settlement.</li>
<li><strong>Temple hairpieces.</strong> These hairpieces are fastened symmetrically at the side of the head, and accompany the fountain. Traditionally an exclusively male style, it was incorporated into women‚Äôs culture in postwar liberalisation.</li>
<li><strong>Uroastopet (birth flower) hairpieces.</strong> Flowers are central component of Vekllei animistic iconography, and their employ with people is analogous to Zodiac or astrological traditions. A birth flower is usually attached as a hairpiece in ceremony to distinguish the girl against the stars, acknowledging the chance in her birth not dependent on blood or heritage.</li>
<li><strong>Floral collar pins.</strong> These are recent items that first appeared in the last half-century, in response to the urbanisation of Vekllei life. Where traditionally flowers would be attached to the collar, here they are replaced by enamel and metal pins that are also worn with business and school shirts.</li>
<li><strong>Regional Flower Plate.</strong> This unusual item displays a special floral arrangement, called a <em>ro poisnesn</em> (flower-tundra blood arrangement) which can be genuine or artificial. It displays a curated collection of flowers from the girl‚Äôs village or region, usually selected from a local flower-tundra.</li>
<li><strong>Camisole Pinafore.</strong> These pinafores first appeared as detachable suspenders in the 19th century and have become an indispensable component of styles and uniforms since. Like most elements of Vekllei ceremonial dress, its origins are in agriculture.</li>
<li><strong>Refined Women‚Äôs Tie.</strong> A woman‚Äôs tie is carefully folded to respect the integrity of its sacred source; the shape and cascading petals of the <em>Oa</em> flower, which is the national Vekllei symbol. Men have a similar item that fastens to the neck of a tie.</li>
<li><strong>School/workplace armband.</strong> Armbands are universal in Vekllei. Instead of a symptom of authoritarian workplace culture, they are instead seen as markers in the country of public face. They are found in most professions and schools and have even seen ironic popularity in progressive fashion scenes.</li>
<li><strong>Dien agricultural shirt.</strong> These loose, baggy cotton shirts rolled at the elbow are a uniquely Vekllei style of dress, and appeared just prior to the time of the Camisole pinafore. Originally a male item, it is mostly worn by women today in professional and casual settings alike.</li>
<li><strong>Uroaten floral belt.</strong> These belts are mural testaments to the lineage of a girl, usually displaying the birth flowers of her female relatives.</li>
<li><strong>Bell Sash.</strong> The bell sash jingles as she moves and it sounds nice. The girls pick the bells themselves, and different sounds have different meanings.</li>
<li><strong>Oanan lace apron.</strong> These aprons are rarely worn, because they are extremely delicate, but they are precious cultural items often handed down through generations. Girls are often married in them. In postwar life, they are iconic for how the woman has been liberated from work ‚Äî where even her aprons are stripped of utility and transformed into beautiful decorations.</li>
<li><strong>Honey half-cape.</strong> Vekllei is very cold, and half-capes or full-capes are often worn. You‚Äôll find them in school uniforms and throughout professional workplaces in the country. They are interchangeable with other long coats, but are beloved for their versatility, warmth and softness.</li>
<li><strong>Gi quarter-pleat.</strong> These are very sacred items, and are designed specifically for the girl at her menarche. They usually incorporate their birth flower, birth festival and other iconography into their patterns. Girls wear them to school. Boys also have <em>gi</em>, but they are much smaller and not nearly as intricate.</li>
<li><strong>Glory Sash.</strong> A glory sash is affixed to the <em>uroaten</em> and proclaims the beauty of the girl‚Äôs family through religious iconography and runes, called <em>upotenne</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Thousand-pleat skirt.</strong> Traditionally skirts without pleats are worn, but postwar manufacturing has gifted young women with many types of skirt and pleat less varieties have been largely substituted for decorated or ‚Äúthousand-pleat‚Äù versions.</li>
<li><strong>Sun petticoat.</strong> These are petticoats that hang below the hem, and often accompany the <em>oanan</em> lace apron as a set. Like the <em>oanan</em>, these are very delicate and are usually only worn on special occasions. Pure white, they dirty easily below the hem and are mostly decorative, although they do have utility in supporting the weight of the girl‚Äôs skirt with pleat and sash attached.</li>
<li><strong>Mido socks.</strong> A longer cotton sock is folded three times to make a cuff, which offers versatility in a climate that changes without warning. At the hem‚Äôs current fashion, a <em>mido</em> sock can instantly become a stocking of sorts, depending on the make and taste of the girl. They are worn throughout the country, including in business environments.</li>
<li><strong>Misc. felt/leather shoes.</strong> There are several types of traditional Vekllei shoe, from old boots and sandals to modern makes of foreign design, like penny loafers. The choice is the girl‚Äôs, for it is by far the most impermanent style of the outfit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Traditional dress is worn on holidays, to church, in festivals and in ceremony at school and work. To many Vekllei people, it epitomises womanhood.</p>

	  <![CDATA[Tzipora here is wearing a simplified form of Vekllei‚Äôs national dress, which plays fast and loose with lace and showcases some of Vekllei‚Äôs more decadent iconography. Long gi (decorative quarter-pleats you‚Äôve seen around) accompany sun petticoats, or Vekllei lace aprons. Flowers take the place of astrology or the Zodiac in Vekllei, and so they often accompany spiritual runes (in upotenne, or religious script) about the girl.

The loose style of shirt, folded at the elbow, is a deliberate imitation of Vekllei agricultural fashion, and three-fold socks and soft felt or leather shoes are worn by women of many ages and professions. Much like her ecology, Vekllei is also culturally atomised, and in her isolation has developed subtle variations of what might otherwise be dismissed as plain clothing items. Every part of her outfit has heritage and symbolism, often barely detectable to a foreigner.</p>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>4 hours from now I‚Äôm off to Japan again. The last time I was in Japan (August 2019) left me inspired and enthusiastic. While I was there I started work on this subreddit. What a good time it‚Äôs been.</p>
<p>1.2k subscribers later, and I‚Äôm off again. It‚Äôs been a hectic week. I‚Äôm still unpacking into my new house. The house is quite nice. I‚Äôm hoping to return to my roots somewhat, featuring different folks around Vekllei in a rougher concept style. Hopefully, I‚Äôll find the time to stick to the semidaily illustration routine, instead of the 4-5 days I‚Äôve been operating on for the last month or so.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd like to invite anyone interested to the <a href="https://discord.gg/gpatU6H">Vekllei Discord</a>, which has blossomed into really great little community full of art and fashion and photography and all sorts of things. It‚Äôs much better than the r/worldbuilding Discord.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm hoping to do a drawing a day while I‚Äôm over there; the one time a year I acknowledge without caveats the Japanese influence on this worldbuilding project.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Hobart</p>

<p>It seemed an exaggeration to even call it a station, since the bare concrete slab had been laid fifty years ago and left to crumble. The installation of a station sign had been the first work on it in decades. The whole world seemed to have forgotten this place. Every day she would catch the train both ways to university, and watch Vekllei‚Äôs ancient slopes groan by as the train cars rounded the waists of the valleys. There was no hurry out here. There were no thoughts of the future. In Vekllei‚Äôs warm agrestic towns, pastoral spiritualism took many forms; and for her, no site would stir the heart like the old concrete station outside of Montre-Lola.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/dance.jpg"/> <p>Moise has somehow been swindled out of his slow dance in Zelda‚Äôs eighth floor New Years party. I‚Äôd like to invite everyone here to come celebrate at the <a href="https://discord.gg/dCE6vSU">new Vekllei discord</a> ‚Äî we mostly argue about architecture and share art and stories. No pressure, but at least you can hassle me directly about the gap between posts. Speaking of which, this one is a substitute ‚Äî the one I‚Äôm working on ended up being a bit too sad for an exciting new year, so I‚Äôll put the sad stuff off until Jan 2nd in favour of something happier tomorrow.</p>
<p>While Moise sits alone and feels like a cow-handed chucklehead, let‚Äôs wind up the year with some awards I‚Äôll hand out to myself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Runner Up: Favourite Post of 2019</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/auz580/the_forgotten_generation/"><em>The Forgotten Generation</em></a></p>
<p>Old photographs have a certain tragedy to them. Especially considering the hardships of the past. I like the maoist elements of the uniforms and the vague sense of loss.</p>
<p><strong>Runner Up: Worst Post of 2019</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/e6iykk/wallabies_of_the_arctic_veklleis_pademelon_and/"><em>Wallabies of the Arctic</em></a></p>
<p>The pademelons are cute, and were fun to draw. Somehow I managed to make Tzipora, whom I‚Äôve been drawing since I was 15, incredibly ugly and awkward to look at. The expression I was trying to draw is fine in theory; the shape and colour of the face is wrong. You‚Äôve got to wonder what I was thinking, posting it without alterations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Favourite Post of 2019</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/c05k16/absolute_grotesque/"><em>Absolute Grotesque</em></a></p>
<p>As anyone who does creative work knows, you don‚Äôt usually anticipate your favourite work. This one was made in about four hours (it was the quickest landscape I ever did).</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt always like the dark stuff, but this one just turned out well. The lore doesn‚Äôt waste any words, and it says exactly what I wanted to say about the subject. It‚Äôs clear and simple and I like reading back through it. The art is much better than more recent attempts at similar subjects, and there‚Äôs a brevity to the art and lore that I usually fuck up. I‚Äôve made many posts now trying to recreate it.</p>
<p><strong>Worst Post of 2019</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/dj5di0/uniform_ideology_in_the_arctic_north/"><em>Uniform Ideology in the Arctic North</em></a></p>
<p>You‚Äôll have to trust me when I say the women‚Äôs uniform is extraordinarily beautiful. Despite its capes and gold, it can be stripped of ornamentation and reduced to a white shirt and red skirt, recalling images of Taiwan in the White Terror or postwar Vietnam. It has a fundamental simplicity and adaptability that‚Äôs quite important to me.</p>
<p>You‚Äôll have to trust me about all that, because it does not carry through in this post at all. It‚Äôs not that there‚Äôs one particular element that makes a post shitty; it‚Äôs just the total half-arsed effort throughout. Uniform ideology is such an untapped concept, and I wasted it here. The girls look strange. The only good thing about this post is that it introduced me to several nice fellow worldbuilders that I would go on to collaborate with.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is your best and worst? I know my choices might be a bit surprising. If you comment that the worst is &ldquo;every post&rdquo;, I‚Äôll ban you.</p>
<p>Finally, cheers to all of you here and at my Patreon. I‚Äôve had a slow month for drawing, and I‚Äôve got to find a place to live by this weekend, but we‚Äôve got good things ahead. I‚Äôm back in Japan on the 9th, so expect some vitality there. I love drawing on the trains there. I was inspired to make this subreddit after my last visit in August, actually.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm trying to get back to making posts every other day ‚Äî it‚Äôs the best feeling in the world to put stuff up here, but sometimes life just gets in the way. January is a time of rebirth, and Tzipora is eternal ‚Äî there will be lots of Vekllei to come.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs to 2020.</p>
<p>Hobart.</p>
<p>P.S. Moise did, in fact, get his slow dance.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Her study was well beyond mere communication by now, venturing further into the pleasures of language and poetry. It made her smile to think back at where she‚Äôd been just five years before. She recalled images of a nervous immigrant thumbing through her dictionary at a tram stop, terrified of the nonsense characters around her.</p>
<p>Geysers are the heart of Vekllei spiritualism. The town of Geyser in Vekllei is in fact the origin of the word. They are symptomatic of Vekllei‚Äôs naturalistic statehood ‚Äî a testament to the impermanence of landscape and the symbiosis of people and soil. The geysers, once barren jewels of harsh volcanic landscapes, were now ringed by foliage at their edges as the seeds unwittingly carried by travellers blossomed in rich volcanic earth.</p>
<p>Vekllei people will visit from a young age. Nothing is signposted ‚Äî there is no natural infrastructure. Several deaths a year are reported. As a Vekllei child you develop a relationship with your spring, and learn its unique qualities. Where it is safe to draw water, for example, and where it will boil your skin in a flash. You learn its colour and smell. In rural communities, they are an essential organ, where birth and marriage and death coalesce. Vekllei heritage is not dominated by blood, but by earth, and no clearer are the sites of life than amidst her ancient volcanoes, where the wind carries steam across dark igneous slopes.</p>

Pictured is the apartment of our very own Zelda. While the building itself deserves a feature, for now we‚Äôll discuss Newda as a theory and her life in this building.

I&rsquo;m not sure how I feel about this post, I might have indulged too much, but either way, I&rsquo;m BACK</em>. &ndash;  Hobart</p>
<h3 id="argument">
  Argument
  <a class="anchor" href="#argument">#</a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúA man of the eighteenth century, plunged suddenly into our civilisation, might well have the impression of something akin to a nightmare.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Äî Frederick Etchells, <em>Towards a New Architecture.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some critics of architecture (and adjacent slugs) deride <em>Newda</em> as decadent. It is as incestuous and plastic as most other modernist constructions, they say. It mistakes austerity for utility, and <em>le blanc</em> for cleanliness. This is not an unreasonable criticism, especially since foundational Vekllei cultural principles of natural immersion and human decay seem irreconcilable with the white, shining concrete of her modern cityscape. How does a style like <em>Newda</em> claim to be anything other than a reckless adoption of continental urbanism for its own sake; a symptom of the social decay we call postwar austerity?</p>
<p>For these people, <em>Newda</em> represents a grotesque squandering of a rare, virgin landscape which had been wiped clean in the atomic war. It is impossible to imagine any other means by which the opportunity to rebuild today‚Äôs modern cities might arise. She could have been Paris, critics say ‚Äî entirely unaware that they are discussing a city more beautiful than Paris. ‚ÄúOh, to see Rome reduced to urbanist tower-blocks‚Äù; ‚Äúa garden city of concrete and asbestos‚Äù; ‚Äúa cauldron of plastic and rebar‚Äù; and so on go the tears. ‚ÄúNever had tacky decadence looked so plain.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere exists a new spirit,‚Äù Le Corbusier wrote in <em>Towards a New Architecture</em>. ‚ÄúOur own epoch is determining, day by day, its own style. Our eyes, unhappily, are unable yet to discern it.‚Äù</p>
<p>What a tantalising phrase that was, when it finally reached Vekllei‚Äôs shores from his native France. Not just for its celebration of a young era, which appeals to Vekllei‚Äôs fluid and agnostic antihistoricism, but for its appeal to ‚Äúspirit‚Äù, which gestures towards the intimate and gentle Vekllei nature. Hence the critics‚Äô fundamental mischaracterisation of Vekllei‚Äôs great modernist project ‚Äî namely that the country understands nature as an organ alienated from their ‚Äúcivilisation,‚Äù or that they recognise their √¶sthetics as a progression of history. Neither is true, as is plain to anyone who has been to any part of Vekllei. Landscape is suppressed in Vekllei, even in an industrial age, and so there is no schism between the human and the natural worlds despite the fact that they live in tower-blocks and wear clothes of rayon and gingham. And ‚ÄúHistory‚Äù in Vekllei is gutted as easily as they might a tuna for which their cuisine is known; their collective story as a state is one of movements and gestures, laterally and lineally at times, and ‚Äúbackwards‚Äù at others (although to apply such a word to Vekllei is to criminally misunderstand her project).</p>
<p>It is the application of sickly sentimentalist instincts to Vekllei that betray the reactionary criticism of Newda as a ‚Äúsuperficial, austere school of architecture‚Äù for what it is; a deeply historicist suspicion ingrained in the same modernist instincts it claims to critique; at once fucking and wagging a finger at the pig. It is also a brash rejection of Vekllei sociology as a foundation of petticoat ideology, and mistakes Vekllei‚Äôs ‚Äúmaterial culture‚Äù (her buildings, her clothes, her toys) as something somehow disconnected from so-called &ldquo;petticoat intuition&rdquo;, which is just a phrase for the social unconscious that forms consensus in the country on everything from television soaps to her beloved tower-blocks. This is aesthetics in action, what Hegel praised in <em>The Philosophy of Right</em> as ‚Äúphilosophising, which could well have continued to spin itself into its own web of scholastic wisdom, [coming] into closer contact with actuality.‚Äù <em>Newda</em> is real, and it is alive in the instincts of the ordinary Vekllei person.</p>
<p>Paris can burn. <em>Newda</em> will survive a thousand atomic strikes, through that cockroach known as ideology.</p>
<p>Do not let Vekllei architecture, which might be assaulted by promiscuous subjectivity or the bores of American objectivity, be discussed in anything but a sociological arena. When talking about Vekllei things, it is a mistake to rely on uniquely Western (or otherwise) constructs. As Adorno noted in <em>Aesthetics</em>, taste is preprogrammed ‚Äî the ‚Äúsublime,‚Äù so it is invoked, is spiritual phenomenology, dependent on so-called objectivity only insofar as objectivity relates to your postcode and personal wealth. <strong>Tell a man he is listening to a Stradivarius and replace it with any other violin, and watch the sublime grow mold.</strong></p>
<h3 id="theory">
  Theory
  <a class="anchor" href="#theory">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Decoration has nothing to do with sophistication, nor spirituality. Vekllei is characterised by honesty as a premise in itself ‚Äî not in how they talk or how they do business, but in the frankness and clarity of Vekllei culture in ideology and its cities. ‚ÄúHonesty‚Äù is to make plain the exact functioning and beneficiaries of the economy; the production and movement of commercial goods; the labour and value of ‚Äúcommodities‚Äù; and the material and operation of machines and structures.</p>
<p>So too should it inform the foundations of life. Housing is one of the greatest urgencies in the mind ‚Äî and so architecture should respond to urgency with the solidity and reliability required of it. That essence, or ‚Äúform,‚Äù is the premise of a structure, and it requires the reestablishment of architecture not as ‚Äústyle‚Äù but as an ideology built upon a place of living defined by form, purpose, and purity. Newda is characterised by large light wells, common areas, the integration of civic essentials (like food-production, hydroponics, gardens, shallow pools for washing and bathing), and expression through shape. In form, Newda is defined by strong vertical geometry, the baring of utility including pipes and water tanks, and strong colour. Newda structures are constructed in b√©ton brut, even in smaller villages, abiding by the principles of <em>dumousiantopet</em>, or ‚Äòbeautiful and seperate‚Äô. A Newda structure is large enough to house a community but appears gentle and lightweight, since it perches majestically on large columns.</p>
<p>There are many types of Newda buildings designed in many different languages and principles of architecture, but I‚Äôm approaching the character limit here so we‚Äôll pursue them another time.</p>
<h3 id="practice">
  Practice
  <a class="anchor" href="#practice">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Let‚Äôs take a tour with Zelda on her journey inside her building.</p>
<p>Facing the street is a conservatory atrium of ten stories, which is filled with trees. It opens out into the air at its base, since the entire structure is raised on elegant columns that encourage the ground floor as a place of public living. The path to the central elevator towers are lined on each side by a wading pool with a depth of one meter ‚Äî the pool tiles are bright-coloured and contrast each other. They make a good place to cool your feet in summer. Since the load of the structure is vested in columns in the interior, glass encircles the atrium fa√ßade like a ribbon, serving as a natural lightwell and growing space for produce-bearing plants which supplement the Vekllei diet.</p>
<p>Zelda calls an elevator at the free-standing tower, since she lives on the eighth floor. The elevator is glass-lined and she soars up through the canopy of the indoor forest as it moves. The apartments of the eighth floor open into lome a‚Äô pas√¶net or an ‚Äòinternal street‚Äô. These are found in most Vekllei apartment buildings. The street is a long balcony, decadently wide, that runs the length of the interior and connects the five apartments of that floor. Large glass windows in the apartments look out into the internal street, or are hidden with curtains in times of privacy. The street is a popular place to read or meet friends and neighbours, since the yawning interior multiplies the sense of space tenfold, and it received direct sunlight throughout most of the day. At sunset, the glass fa√ßade of the public interior casts a warm, fantastical light on the ten streets of the ten-story building, transforming the space into a prismatic cathedral of light.</p>
<p>Stepping in to the footwell of the apartment, Zelda removes her shoes. There‚Äôs some rumour about the custom dating back to the Viking days as a sign of peaceful intention, but today it‚Äôs for cleanliness. The living room is sunken, and is lighted by the windows looking out into the interior street, which receive sun about the time she comes home. The kitchen overlooks the living space and indoor fig, and includes a large partition/cupboard that can roll on rails across the width of the apartment. There are many small examples of similar modularity throughout the apartment, balanced carefully with Newda‚Äôs affection for permanence. Pipes run beneath the concrete for underfloor heating, providing toasty floors in Vekllei&rsquo;s dark, brutal winters.
The apartment is divided between a semi-public half, which includes the living, dining and cooking areas, and a ‚Äòprivate half‚Äô which contains the two bedrooms, bathroom and laundry.</p>
<p>Zelda took the larger bedroom despite her initial protestations ‚Äî Baron insisted, and so that‚Äôs where she spends all her time when he‚Äôs not home. It‚Äôs by far the biggest space she‚Äôs ever had to herself. In fact, thinking back, this is the first room she hasn‚Äôt had to share since she was ten. In other buildings it would be large enough to house a cramped studio apartment.</p>
<p>Next door is the bathroom. There, you&rsquo;ll find a French bidet, which is separated by a wall from what looks like, at first glance, a modest oriental wet room and bath. The precise opposite is true. It is a Vekllei (that is to say, Scandinavian) wet room. Instead of cleaning your body with a shower and bucket and then soaking in a hot bath, a Vekllei person scalds their skin until it glows and then plunges into a tub of cold water. The contrast of temperature encourages vasodilation and then constriction of the circulatory system, which, in addition to the hydrostatic pressure supplied by the bath, invigorates the skin and can help with muscle fatigue. Some experts believe it may aid the immune system. Vekllei bathers generally do not spend luxurious amounts of time in the bath or shower ‚Äî cleaning is a utilitarian process, which, while shocking and stressful in its temperature contrast, leaves the bather refreshed and with sensitive skin that lends to a feeling of sterility. Public baths work much the same way, through the scalding and cooling principle.</p>
<p>An empty storage room, indicative of Baron and Tzipora&rsquo;s spartan minimalism, conceals a small personal laundry. A private laundry is considered luxurious in Vekllei, especially in urban areas where such things are easily communalised, but these apartment towers are new and these are among its benefits.
Finally, there is Baron&rsquo;s bedroom and study. Like his daughter, he is a creature of routine, perfectly acclimatised to a home of any size. There is enough space here for a full-size electrotype and the books he needs to work from home on the occasions that permit it. Just beyond his door, in the living area, is a prayer table for their respective friends and family who have passed on.</p>

<p>Hello everyone. Hobart here. We hit 1,000 subscribers only a month ago, and it gets a bit tedious to carry on thanking everyone, so I won‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not thanking the commenters who say nice things, and I‚Äôm definitely not thanking the lurkers who continue to validate my self-worth through subreddit metrics. It would be tiresome to mention that it really means a lot and I‚Äôm thankful, so I won‚Äôt.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve got a few updates to share.</p>
<ol>
<li>The new website looks really good. This doesn‚Äôt really affect anything on the subreddit aside from the fact it‚Äôs crippled my output this last week or two. It‚Äôs only in alpha, if anything, but once it‚Äôs polished it‚Äôll be mesmerising. I really mean it. It‚Äôs so fun to play with already. It&rsquo;s not like other project sites.</li>
<li>SkyMonth will wrap up this December. It‚Äôs taken longer than planned, but so what? There‚Äôs lots of planes to come.</li>
<li>I‚Äôd like to thank the handful of kind people who donate to my Patreon. I‚Äôm not much of a drinker, but I like a drop of Irish cream with my tea and coffee, and I‚Äôd have to choose between it and food if it weren‚Äôt for these nice people. I&rsquo;m &ldquo;between jobs,&rdquo; so it really does make a difference. Thank you kindly.</li>
<li>I reckon January will be a free-for-all in terms of posts. I might even pull back and do a really nice, time-intensive painting like I used to. Then we&rsquo;ll go in for a deep-dive themed month (to be revealed).</li>
<li>Comic is being written.</li>
</ol>
<p>I‚Äôve gotten really nice feedback on a few of the character posts. Sorry if I didn‚Äôt reply ‚Äî they were all written between 3-4am to get them over and done with, and I promptly disowned them when I woke up in the morning (might happen with this post too ‚Äî it‚Äôs 3:26am on my clock). It‚Äôs easy to forget most of you don‚Äôt know the characters of this world.</p>
<p>So let me know. What kind of posts are your favourite? What‚Äôs working and what‚Äôs not working? Or you could just say a nice thing about me or my art, those do me just fine as well.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t conclude by thanking you for sticking with Vekllei.</p>
<p>Sleep tight, and see you in the morning,</p>
<p>(something about bed bugs biting)</p>
<p>Hobart.</p>

<p><strong>The rufous-bellied wallaby or &ldquo;pademelon&rdquo;</strong> is often mistaken for a kangaroo or even a rodent, but it is neither. These furry little lumps, known both for their rotundity and fecundity, do not share the dry and tropical temperament of their marsupial cousins throughout Australia and Indonesia, and are most at home in the wet, cold temperate rainforests of the quasiantarctic island of Tasmania. They also have a significant population in the least likely of places; a similarly cool, rainy, forested rock known as Vekllei (or Iceland, historically).</p>
<p>They grow like a radish and their ears rotate independently on the top of their heads, searching for noises that could eat them. They are an excellent meal for any predator, and are ill-equipped for the larger, invaded ecosystems to which they are extinct.</p>
<p>Vekllei, however, in its geographic and environmental isolation, has only a population of arctic foxes and some wolves to threaten them. The island&rsquo;s biosecurity laws are among the strictist in the world, mostly to protect vulnerable birds (like puffins) and the biodiversity of their unique cattle, sheep, dogs and horses. There are entire brigades of Vekllei&rsquo;s armed forces dedicated to the culling of feral dogs and cats, and many species common to the rest of the world ‚Äî rabbits and red foxes come to mind ‚Äî are not found in Vekllei, which employs ruthless culling methods to contain them.</p>
<p>They were introduced intentionally to the Les Noisnosn agricultural belt (just north of Ro) in the early 2010s. Their import was a diplomatic effort between Australia and Vekllei as part of a wider series of gestures designed to reconcile tensions between the country and the British Commonwealth just prior to the First Atomic War. The introduced pademelons were very good at eating non-native grasses which had ravaged the temperate rainforests of the region, and were able to survive on the native mosses and plants once the infestation was dealt with.</p>
<p>Sixty years and an atomic war later, they have spread like wildfire. A healthy population exists across the entire island, and can occasionally even be seen in city parks. Their presence in the arctic, as an Australasian marsupial, is utterly unique. They are so common (and tasty) that there are no restrictions on their hunting, and are a staple of diets in and outside of the country‚Äôs urban areas. In smaller agricultural villages, like Tzipora‚Äôs Montre-Lola, they are hunted locally and prepared for eating in the traditional principles of Upen landcare. The meat is low in fat, mild, and sweet, and is often substituted for beef in Vekllei.</p>
<p>They are timid, docile creatures that sleep in the day and come out at dusk. Outside of cities, they are often kept as pets. Although Tzipora would never keep a pademelon, she would feed a dozen of her favourite regulars each night when they came out to chew on the mosses of her property. She also took part in fostering a joey which went on to live at the village post office.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any questions.</p>

<p>Zelda had a way of attracting trouble.</p>

<p>Two deputies dragged the maid who worked at Motel Grande off Route 70 to a tree beyond the Kennecott salt flats. She was crying the whole time. She was very young for a maid, but girls needed money like anyone else. She was starving. It wasn&rsquo;t the kind of hunger you saw in the National Geographic; it was a long, slow year of starvation, where most of her muscle had wasted away and she‚Äôd been left with a bit of youthful fat around her belly and cheeks. That&rsquo;s just how people looked in Utah in 2063. Atomic power collided with indigence across most of the Southwest.</p>
<p>This girl did not have a last name, because she was some immigrant worker with a fake visa worth less than her shitty hand-me-down rayon uniform. She knew what was coming in the back of the police cruiser and started to tremble uncontrollably as they left the highway. An immigrant expects what happens to immigrants. They pulled up by a stump and a small patch of dead ashes that were visible from the highway that crossed the flats. Would they take a picture of her for a postcard? She didn‚Äôt want that. Who would cut her down? Would they bury her? Suddenly the finality of it hit her ‚Äî who, at all, would remember her?</p>
<p>She was not sure if she was being made an example or an excuse, but could not recall for her life what she‚Äôd done to deserve either. The car engine ticked over as the bigger of the cops slung a thin noose around her neck and yanked on it until it hurt her throat. She pleaded with them in good English, trying to suppress her Latina vocalisations, and cried desperately.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am American,‚Äù she whined, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm from California. Do I look Latina? Look, I‚Äôm white. My mother is from Germany. Please, you have the wrong person.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúHow old are you?‚Äù The big cop asked.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEighteen.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf you start fuckin lying I‚Äôll string you up now. Tell me how old you are.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sixteen. Sixteen,‚Äù she coughed. ‚ÄúI&rsquo;m just a late grower. My father‚Äôs from Salt Lake. Please, I‚Äôm not an immigrant. I was born here. I‚Äôm American.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúShut up; I don‚Äôt give a shit. You live with some girls in town, right? In that house?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn downtown Cherry, yes. Yes, I‚Äôll tell you about it.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd you work for Mr Parker at the motel?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúYes, I do. He‚Äôs nice.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúDo you pay union dues?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúDues? No, I don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúDo you pay any tax?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all cash,‚Äù she blinked tears out of her eyes. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know much about taxes.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll right, Griselda. We‚Äôre going to talk about some of the girls in that house.‚Äù</p>
<p>They asked her some questions and took some notes. What she was doing only occurred to her after the third name. They gave her a sandwich to eat. It wasn‚Äôt out of kindness ‚Äî it was to bask in the absolute violence of their authority. You could find as much pleasure in pardoning a girl as you could beating her. For a moment, on their command, her poverty and fear was excused. She chewed through bologna as she listed out her neighbours, and after a while her tears were for them.</p>
<p>When she was almost done she began to wonder again if they‚Äôd kill her. She‚Äôd finished the sandwich and was unconsciously picking crumbs off her uniform, squishing her fingers pathetically against her lips as her eyes darted nervously between them. They left her there, with the noose around her neck, beneath the dead ash.</p>

<p>Tzipora is doing well now. She has looked into her heart and made peace with who she is. She has discovered she is a girl who likes free jazz, and milky coffee, and cotton shirts, and trains ‚Äî to the surprise of no-one who knows her. She knows what things she values in a friend, and what deserves to become family. She knows what clothes she likes and how to do her hair. A year ago, she was a shivering little girl, but today she has become a glowing young woman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A glowing pleasure though she may be, her nerves are still shot and her past is still with her. Tzipora is a habitual creature, prone to obsessions and addiction, and she‚Äôd suffered many vices by the time she met Baron. For a while it had been sleeping pills with the other girls in the Women‚Äôs House, chasing the mind-bending effects of a methaqualone high and sleep deprivation. It was about that time she picked up cigarettes, which helped with the tics she was cultivating in her violent poverty.</p>
<p>She never quite kicked them. Like the tics, they stuck around. For a girl whose joy filled mountains and lows loomed cliffs, a cigarette now and then took some of that edge off. Ayn never liked her habit. Baron never asked her about it ‚Äî he knew, she thought. He knew what it was like to feel the walls closing in.</p>
<p>It made for some awkward encounters, not least of which was a moment of panic the first time Cobian stayed over. Zelda has always suffered very bad dreams most nights, and her fear of waking her friend led her out onto the frigid balcony in the early hours of the morning. Six drags in, the lights turned on and the door slid open. An awkward minute of fumbling followed, pushing Zelda into territory she was uncomfortable sharing with anyone but Baron.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo it helps?‚Äù Cobian asked, mulling over the idea with her legs to her chest. Tzipora was fidgeting miserably in the cold.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhere do you get them? The cigarettes?‚Äù She asked, as though Tzipora would mistake the question.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey‚Äôre Baron‚Äôs.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd what happens if you stop?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Zelda sniffed. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to make it a big deal, anyway. I don‚Äôt like this. I don‚Äôt like doing it, but what helps, helps.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúCan I try? I‚Äôve never tried.‚Äù</p>
<p>A moment later Tzipora laid a hand gently across the girl&rsquo;s mouth to quiet the vicious coughing and hacking for fear it would wake Baron.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShh. It‚Äôs okay, I know it‚Äôs not good,‚Äù she soothed. Even as a genuine teen-ager Tzipora had been maternal.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs terrible,‚Äù Cobian gasped.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI know. But it helps. Let‚Äôs go inside, I‚Äôll get you some water.‚Äù</p>
<p>Although Tzipora would always operate according to the charter of her various obsessions, she was always slightly self-conscious about the cigarettes. Even sixty years later she only smoked alone. It was unbecoming of a satisfied person, she supposed, let alone a woman in the body of a girl. Still, for all her quirks and all her ticks, to most people her little vices were the most normal thing about her. She was a figure of contradictions, and her weaknesses were just as precious to her loved ones as her tremendous strength and bigness of heart.</p>

  Overview
  <a class="anchor" href="#overview">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Although Vekllei‚Äôs flag-carrying airline might appear just one of many in the small island country, don‚Äôt be fooled ‚Äî all civilian aviation operates under a <em>venrouive</em> bureau excitingly titled the Vekllei Air Service (Skyburo), which operates several distinct ‚Äòairlines‚Äô but wholly controls all of them. In Vekllei economic lexicon, a bureau is the largest trade union of an industry, made up of many hundreds of others, and is partially beholden to the direction of government.</p>
<p>This makes the Skyburo a ‚Äòpublic airline,‚Äô but is not government owned in the way the rest of the world might understand it. Vekllei segregates business only along personal and public lines, with the political organs of the country largely segregated from daily affairs.</p>
<p>Illustrated here for your viewing pleasure are the largest of Vekllei‚Äôs ‚Äòairlines,‚Äô represented by their stewards in uniform.</p>
<h3 id="vekllei-air-service">
  Vekllei Air Service
  <a class="anchor" href="#vekllei-air-service">#</a>
</h3>
<p><strong>The Vekllei Air Service</strong> is Vekllei‚Äôs domestic airline, and operates within the country as well as to Vekllei‚Äôs semiautonomous Atlantic possessions like Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the Azores. The fleet are mostly twin or tri-engined nuclear jets. Vekllei has a comprehensive rail network, and the domestic VAS is mostly used to ferry people between Vekllei‚Äôs various islands.</p>
<h3 id="the-domestic-office">
  The Domestic Office
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-domestic-office">#</a>
</h3>
<p><strong>The Domestic Office</strong> is an unusual organisation largely responsible for unusual or unique aircraft that require specific training to command. These include sea planes, dirigible airships, helijets and so on. Their navy and white uniforms are remarkably simple, even spartan, and are the last remaining legacy of private commercial aviation in Vekllei‚Äôs pre-war years. There was not much money for uniforms then, and they carry on in this humble tradition today.</p>
<h3 id="vekllei-overseas-airways">
  Vekllei Overseas Airways
  <a class="anchor" href="#vekllei-overseas-airways">#</a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Vekllei Overseas Airways</strong> is the international flag-carrier of the country, and compete with the likes of Pan-Am and BOAC. Their uniforms are the public face of Vekllei for many foreigners, and so they reflect both the dignity of the island nation and the high price required of foreigners for travel on the national carrier. It is customary to receive a bottle of Montre wine with a ticket. They also employ capes on male and female stewards, but they must be removed on the tarmac. They operate ‚Äòflying wings‚Äô, large jets and a handful of airships called sky liners.</p>
<h3 id="the-special-charter-service">
  The Special Charter Service
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-special-charter-service">#</a>
</h3>
<p><strong>The Special Charter Service</strong> is an unusual branch of the Skyburo, and is usually regarded as a government airline. Although civilian, it coordinates closely with Vekllei‚Äôs military and intelligence services to assist in moving personnel, and also would be responsible for evacuating Vekllei tourists in the event of an incident overseas or at home. Day-to-day, it operates only a few scheduled flights, with the bulk of its flight-hours spent operating charter services for bureaus and personal business alike. They wear uniforms styled after Vekllei cultural dress, which predates even the old regime and is a strong part of the national identity.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/blueshoes.jpg"/> <p>Welcome to the r/Vekllei variety hour, where the tone between posts judders so inconsistently you&rsquo;ll get whiplash of the mind. I was just drawing and thinking today. This is an author post, in case you haven&rsquo;t noticed &ndash; just a shitty blog.</p>
<p>You see, even today I&rsquo;m wildly jealous of the success of those slice-of-life artists on reddit and Twitter. I still don&rsquo;t understand the genre entirely, as a phenomenon. It&rsquo;s usually male artists (at least in Japan), drawing distinctly Japanese neighbourhoods and landscapes, and situating a schoolgirl in the midst of it. They&rsquo;re usually pretty amazing scenes. It&rsquo;s almost always a schoolgirl, too &ndash; in modern Tokyo uniform or „Çª„Éº„É©„ÉºÊúç.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still trying to figure it out. It&rsquo;s obviously not sexual objectification, like so much elsewhere in Japanese illustration &ndash; in fact, it&rsquo;s usually nothing more than mundane or wistful scenes featuring some girl. But why is it always a girl? If it&rsquo;s supposed to evoke a nostalgia for a childhood you&rsquo;ve never had, why is it so rarely schoolboys? It&rsquo;s surely to do with cuteness &ndash; &lsquo;cuteness&rsquo; is almost always a female burden, and cute art is good, happy art. I don&rsquo;t have any stats for this, but anecdotally most of the SOL artists I follow are men, and I reckon a large chunk of the audience for it is too. It&rsquo;s boys creating cuteness for boys.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s interesting for me because Vekllei has a lot of similarities to slice-of-life art. I&rsquo;m in the business of peddling nostalgia for places you&rsquo;ve never been, and Tzipora is very much a girl who is very much in uniform a few days a week. It almost reads as satire, in fact &ndash; Tzipora will never stop being a girl, since she is one of thirteen in the world to &rsquo;not age,&rsquo; as per her canon diagnosis. I don&rsquo;t like to think that I&rsquo;m carrying on in that tradition, or that I&rsquo;m infantilising or deliberately cutifying these characters, but does intention matter at all?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure there&rsquo;s anything wrong with it, anyway. It&rsquo;s just that sometimes I look back through my catalogue, see its female/male ratio, and consider if I&rsquo;m not just buying into the same kawaii currency.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a cute picture of Tzipora I made. <a href="https://imgur.com/TiBF1xe">I made a wallpaper of it</a>, if you&rsquo;d like it. Let me know what you think about the slice of life art crowd; I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve got a decent overlap, aside from the cool bros here only for the hardcore geopolitik deprezzion posts.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/coup.jpg"/> <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just pulled a body from an air force jet here that looks like General MacMillan, and we really need to know right now if it&rsquo;s him.‚Äù</p>
<p>The partially buried remains of a U.S. Air Force passenger aircraft are the only blemish on the horizon of central Greenland‚Äôs frigid snowscape. It is the site of one of the greatest political scandals in American history. The ancient landscape was violently disturbed in late December of 2068, when a Grumman Atomcat slammed into the ground, killing all 10 people on board.</p>
<p>The Common Interest Watchhawk programme allowed a Soviet naval patrol to report the disappearance of a low-flying aircraft without a transponder. The bodies pulled from the wreckage some hours later would set in motion a panic among Vekllei‚Äôs intelligence agencies and a bloody purge in America‚Äôs south.</p>
<p>Vekllei military intelligence units, who arrived at the site not long after the search began, battled irradiation from the aircraft‚Äôs reactor and freezing temperatures to confirm the origins of the mystery aircraft.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs him, all right. This is bad news.‚Äù</p>
<p>An intelligence servant of the Vekllei Intelligence Americas Bureau (AB/NI) examined the brutalised face of the general. After a moment of consideration, perhaps to reassure himself of the identity of the cadaver, he ordered a suppression order over the site, which would enforce radio silence and conceal the disaster from the political organs of the Vekllei state for up to six hours.</p>
<p>MacMillan had been distinguished in the U.S.A.F., but would have been an unremarkable soldier in history if it were not for the separatist movements of the Southern states in the late 21st century. The Marshal became Commander-in-Chief overnight, and quickly positioned himself as a lynchpin of negotiation between the separatist and federal governments. As a reasonable military man, he was trusted by the Federal committee, and was at the time of his demise negotiating the lend-lease of strategic nuclear sites that had been seized under the de facto splintering of the United States.</p>
<p>Under the lease, the United States Armed Forces would retain control of sites essential for ‚ÄòAmerican continental security,‚Äô but would withdraw sanctions against the separatist states first imposed under the Dallas Accords. So what the fuck was MacMillan doing mangled on a Greenland ice slope?</p>
<p>Among the dead was his mistress Olivia Scott-Madison and his two children, Daniel and Sofia MacMillan. His children were in nightclothes. Fighter jets were buzzing the Atlantic. It was clear something had gone terribly wrong in the hours prior.</p>
<p>The outside world would never learn the details of the MacMillan Incident, or its causes. What would follow, however, was the purge of many longtime associates of MacMillan from the military hierarchy of the Dallas Coalition states, and the immediate denunciation of the General and his political associates. AB/NI had long chased whispers of a coup against Dallas leadership in the months prior, and it appeared the perpetrator had arrived spectacularly closer to Vekllei‚Äôs gaze than anticipated. The bodies of the General, his family and his aides were flown to Vekllei, where they were identified and placed into archives. Both prime ministers of the country were informed, but were told that Vekllei would not need to worry about attempted American reclamation of the crash site or its occupants. Sure enough, neither the aircraft nor the bodies of its passengers were formally requested by the U.S. or the Dallas states.</p>
<p>The findings of an investigation into the crash were inconclusive and quickly shelved. The aircraft was flying low, perhaps to avoid radar detection, so it was possible the pilots misjudged their altitude in the poor weather. Perhaps there had been an incident on board. There were no technical faults determined in the remains of the aircraft, which remains on that slope to this day.</p>
<p>What was known to the wider world was that the proceeding months would spark the bloodiest period of the ongoing American crisis, and the collapse of diplomatic relations between the separatist and federal governments. MacMillan and his family were the first of the vanguard separatists to die, but they were far from the last.</p>

<p>JM&rsquo;s got a very big world and a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jm_draws_stuff/">very good instagram</a>. I&rsquo;d recommend checking out both.

<p>Hobart here. You might not know it, but I‚Äôm sort of a big fucking deal on the internet. No, don‚Äôt touch me. Why am I? Because my subreddit just hit 1,000 subscribers. What‚Äôs a subreddit? I‚Äôm actually laughing at you; imagine not knowing what reddit is. <em>You ingrate</em>.</p>
<p>Seriously though, this whole renewal of the project through a subreddit (rather than disconnected r/worldbuilding posts) has been an amazing thing. It gives me more wriggle room in what I can talk about, and ‚Äî even better ‚Äî allows me introduce you to my characters, who are very precious to me.</p>
<p>Your State of the Subreddit bulletin follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you‚Äôll turn your attention to the badges on this post, I‚Äôve scribbled up a few community awards for fun. They‚Äôre both 500 coins, the cheapest I can make it. They can‚Äôt give you premium. Reddit is garbage and they don‚Äôt really deserve your money, but some of the regulars here are pretty wonderful and if they ask a really good question or something you can reward them in a way you never could in Vekllei ‚Äî with money. I made them so I can hand them out, really. You can choose from &lsquo;Medal of Valour&rsquo; for long-time service or &lsquo;Great Question&rsquo; for, uh, you can probably guess. Let me know what you think. Do I need more types?</li>
<li>For my new friends, of which there are many of you, it might take a while to settle into Vekllei‚Äôs world and characters. For example, Tzipora, pictured here abusing a friend, also goes by Zelda. If you get confused, you can check out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/czi423/a_brief_introduction_to_vekllei/">this meta intro to the project</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/czi423/a_brief_introduction_to_vekllei/">this brief summary of Vekllei as a country</a>.</li>
<li>I‚Äôve got a few different projects going, in addition to the regular posts. <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/melonkony">I‚Äôve made a Twitch</a>, since it‚Äôs literally a single button on my iPad to stream me working. This isn‚Äôt the start of some illustrious streaming career, just something that was easy to do. <a href="https://www.patreon.com/vekllei">I also have a Patreon</a>, if you‚Äôd like to send a few dollars my way for the posts or food or whatever else. On the horizon is the graphic novel (no two ways about it, it‚Äôs a long-term project but it‚Äôs coming), and a few special experiments.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks again for hanging around. I‚Äôm very lucky to have a community that responds to my work. So many of you have reached out personally and interrogated my posts and it‚Äôs very flattering to attract that sort of interest. I‚Äôll keep on keeping on.</p>

Where the rest of the country has black sand, a symptom of its volcanic turbulence, Mumen has nice yellow sand.</p>
<p>Baron doesn‚Äôt like the water, and getting him down to the sea at all was a trial. Zelda, for her part, sinks faster than lead in water and only ventures into the shallows with Ayn, who herself is afraid of the deeper ocean. She spends most of her time on the beach in her clothes, watching the other girls splash and compare suits.</p>
<p>Baron here is reading his paper, <em>The Atlantic</em>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/cw44hm/sweat_and_ink_in_the_vekllei_news_agency/">I wrote a bit about that organisation here</a>. Zelda is reading a horror gazette. A naturally curious girl who enjoys newsreels and documentary, she swaps with him when they‚Äôre done. He claims he doesn‚Äôt like her horror gazettes, but he keeps taking them, and he keeps reading them.</p>
<p>The sunsets of Vekllei are nearly as legendary as the Aurora, and when the end of the day is at their backs it‚Äôs finally dark enough to face the sun and watch it settle. They take the tram home and finish reading in the warmth of their eighth-floor apartment.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/tourist.jpg"/> <p>It is very difficult to obtain papers for tourism in Vekllei as an American, despite the fact that the Arctic island nation is positioned obstinately between the Americas and Europe. It‚Äôs not made difficult for any discernible political reason, either ‚Äî relations with the U.S. are as good as they could be for a country like Vekllei. Nonetheless, tourism is regarded as a risk rather than an opportunity, and most Americans who visit for pleasure are wealthy enough to put up the sums of cash required to enter on the national carriers that exclusively operate in Vekllei‚Äôs airspace.</p>
<p>Stepping out into the country for the first time is a hell of an experience. As an American you don‚Äôt really have a framework for understanding these people. They‚Äôre not European, or really Scandinavian. They don‚Äôt share many cultural or political bonds with the continental powers. And they‚Äôre not as easy to politicise or orientalise in the same way the folk of the USSR or Asia can be. They‚Äôre a mystery.</p>
<p>Furthermore, work in Vekllei is social, and there are no real laws governing child labour. It is common to see children as young as twelve working as guides in the city‚Äôs largest jetport, Vekllei International, since work is basically a form of play. The dependence on Vekllei people for help (since a foreigner can only navigate society with the assistance of those that speak the language and understand the economy) essentially infantilises dignified, wealthy tourists otherwise not used to being looked down upon. This is further exaggerated by Vekllei‚Äôs complete absence of honourifics, lack of professional culture and suspicion of foreigners, meaning that even tourist infrastructure in the country regards Americans as a curiosity to be investigated and gawked at.</p>
<p>These barriers to entry only further isolate the country from the outside world, in a position that is (in the late 2070s) totally unique. They are not quite &lsquo;white&rsquo;, not quite &lsquo;religious&rsquo;, not quite &lsquo;Western&rsquo; and not quite &lsquo;communist&rsquo;. Their iconography is nonsense; their language is spoken only by themselves, and their political motivations are as complex and built on intuition as they are incomprehensible to outsiders. Hence the scene above, where the new assistant to the ambassador and his wife are thumbed out of the terminal by a thirteen-year-old girl who speaks broken English.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The young worker pictured here carries only a radio for communicating with her colleagues and a pouch to fill with personal items, jelly beans or whatever takes her fancy. They work in shifts of usually a few hours each, which are coordinated with the larger nuclear monowing jets that land from the Americas around noon.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/timetable.jpg"/> <p>Let&rsquo;s wind down Study Month with a look into the Vekllei curriculum. A few days ago I wrote about how Vekllei schools operate on fundamentally different assumptions about what it means to be ‚Äòa child‚Äô. Let‚Äôs take a look at how that pans out in practice.</p>
<p>Most students study about 3-5 days a week, depending on the taste of the student and the work timetable of their parents. These days might occur sequentially or be scattered throughout the week, but most common is a Monday-Wednesday table table of four hours a day.</p>
<p>Tzipora, whose previous schooling was in a Catholic school in California, struggled to make sense of her timetable at first. The Vekllei curriculum very quickly depreciates courses outside of the interest of the student, and so staples of modern Western education ‚Äî science, history, mathematics, language, were jumbled and in some cases dropped altogether.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs break down her timetable, illustrated partially in English for your convenience.</p>
<ol>
<li>Mathematics. Zelda struggles with even basic maths, and so she retains a course for her own wellbeing. Mandatory curriculum maths in Vekllei is mostly pragmatic and straightforward, and teaches theory as well as the basics of calculation and operations. More abstract maths like algebra and calculus are generally only taught in advanced classes designed to facilitate interest in those who show promise in it. Zelda is not one of them.</li>
<li>Language. Zelda is an immigrant and at this point in her life speaks only primitive, conversational Vekllei. Because of this, she has three hours of class time a week but attends a special class for tutoring after school each day. She also makes use of her own time to study Vekllei logographs, called <em>Topet</em>. Baron is a good help because she can practice conversationally with him without the shame of mangling language in the real world.</li>
<li>Ideology. Zelda for the first time in her life is beginning to engage with the world as a global network, and is quickly learning geography and flags to illustrate it in her mind. The Ideology class is concerned with worldview and how social structures influence it. It looks at traditional political ideologies as well as unconscious assumptions, and how those things affect policy and geopolitics.</li>
<li>Chemistry. Zelda likes chemistry and has good grades in it, and so she‚Äôs testing her ability in that area. Although she‚Äôs clearly developed an aptitude for the arts and language, she‚Äôs young enough to doubt her place and still enjoys experimenting with disciplines outside her expertise.</li>
<li>Sewing. Zelda likes sewing, and it helps her feel useful since she‚Äôs largely dependent on others for most other parts of her life. This class teaches young Vekllei people practical skills for maintaining clothes in the household. Next year, she plans to take on a more rigorous maintenance course to varnish wood and caulk windows, since it takes forever to get a contractor up to their apartment.</li>
<li>Illustration. Zelda does not have enough of an ego to be intimidated by the skills of those around her, so she enjoys the class as a therapeutic outlet for her boundless creative impulses. She is trying to learn to draw portraits so she can do one of Baron for Christmas.</li>
<li>Club time. Zelda belongs to the news club of Lola 7th School, and works on weekends as a photographer for the weekly newsletter. Her colleagues are polite and ambitious, and they appreciate her desire to learn. On school time she mostly meets with other members to help print the newsletter by hand on the old jobber press, and develop her photos in the school‚Äôs dark lab.</li>
<li>Society. Zelda learns Vekllei history and values in this class, which helps explain everything from the intricacies of the Bureau System and Sundress Municipalism to more intimate notions of the proper way to wear a quarter-pleat and <em>semoisnesne</em> (sun-facing attitude). It also helps contrast Vekllei‚Äôs system against the rest of the world, and more explicitly outlines Vekllei‚Äôs place in it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although Tzipora would have many troubles with school, none of them were ever related to her enthusiasm for her classes. Since she picked the ones that benefited her and had plenty of time off to explore the skills learned in them, she developed a healthy curiosity for her talents and it was reflected well in her grades. But, as most Vekllei students will tell you, they learn just as much growing up outside of school as they do inside the classroom. She would not have it any other way.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/racing.jpg"/> <p>Each year, a race is held amongst the most remarkable geological monuments of Vekllei&rsquo;s interior. Steep mountains forged in the restlessness of the European and American tectonic plates become deadly checkpoints in the world&rsquo;s most high-stakes aeroplane race in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Low-speed, high-maneuverability jets (manufactured by the likes of General Reactor, V.K. Heavy Industries, and Kaleidoscope Aerospace) roar through narrow valleys in time trials that last only a few minutes. These jets are built differently from your standard light aerocraft, and feature heavily shielded reactors and cockpits (or, unusually, combustion engines), automatic ejection mechanisms, and a fuselage and wings designed to crumple upon impact. They are constructed first and foremost around high-velocity crashes.</p>
<p>Although a high-risk sport where fatalities are common, it remains popular in Europe and Vekllei. In the latter, the races are organised and subsidised by air racing orgs, usually clubs or pilot associations, and enthusiasts hike the otherworldly slopes of the valleys to watch racing jets compete for glory. In a world where seconds make the difference between failure and a world record, aerocrafts and pilots are pushed to their limits.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs talk about childhood and utopia. This post comes as we wind down Study Month in r/vekllei. Strap in kids, because this one gets kind of heavy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tzipora and Cobian, pictured here, have very different stories but both have felt something was not quite right about them. That difference, so it would turn out, would blossom into a preference for women as partners, in the unusual desexualised way Vekllei goes about homosexuality in the late 2070s. To Cobian, who grew up in Vekllei, the realisation was fairly straightforward, although not without moments of anxiety and doubt. To Tzipora, who grew up in the United States, she found herself in crisis. She had previously held deep reservations about so-called ‚Äòbolshevik lesbianism,‚Äô only to discover a contradictory, immutable fact about herself. The canyon between their understandings of how relationships work reveals just how unique Vekllei is in the world today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of many pains of Vekllei‚Äôs growing material wealth was the economic unchaining of women from their husbands, and a shift towards solitude and independence for both men and women. For many, especially in the anxiety of the First Atomic War, lust became work, and marriages and birthrates fell quickly. As the poverty of post-war life developed into fledgling community-focused industry, so too did so-called ‚Äúeconomic feminisation‚Äù (the abolishment of the male burden through the bureau system and work as pleasure) bring about changes in how women understood themselves in a society without commodity.</p>
<p>These economic facts coincided with serious cultural seizures of anger and confusion at the collapse of old values and the bloodline-focused family, which culminated in a period of great population stagnation and cultural unrest without anything to fill the vacuum.</p>
<p>In a move rare for Vekllei‚Äôs growing council-style democracy called Sundress Municipalism, a cultural movement was enacted at a national level. It was called something along the lines of a ‚Äòsun-facing‚Äô attitude, or <em>semoisnesne</em>, in which free love, relationship pragmatism and most of all, familial independence were encouraged to foster baby-making and marriage happiness. Realistically, this cultural ambition was reinforced with several hundred social programmes designed to mitigate domestic violence, marriage breakdown and divorce. The restructuring of the post-war legal system, in conjunction with semoisnesne, had the unintended side-effect of decriminalising homosexuality, making Vekllei one of the few countries in the world to have done so. Normalisation was not a smooth experience, and social problems linger to this day, but is nonetheless utterly unique in the cultural landscape of the modern Western world.</p>
<p>Semoisnesne, like most cultural phenomena, has seen a downturn in popularity in the most recent generation of teen-agers and young adults, as part of a wider trend of emotional and sexual reticence in part as a reaction to the ostentatious displays of sexuality of the decades prior.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, semoisnesne has made Vekllei a better country. It is now much easier to announce your preference for love in your own gender than it was previously, and that brings with it a whole shift in worldview ‚Äî most crucially of normalisation, where such things are tolerated and visible in everyday society. Like many ambitious progressive projects, it has become a cultural pariah in recent years (teens today sarcastically refer to their attitude as <em>lumoisnesne</em>, which better translates to good-facing [in the sense of a moral or ethical good]), but its marked impact on emotional intelligence and feminisation of the country has undeniably set Vekllei apart in a time dominated by fear and cultural retreat.</p>

<p>As much of Vekllei‚Äôs uniform ideology straddles complex (and often precipitous) schisms of modern and traditional clothing items, boys have received considerably more progressive attention than their sisters.

<p>Visible here are the standard armbands universal to Vekllei life, a male tie (although only male in an education context, and is often appropriated by rebellious young women), and a captain‚Äôs plate to distinguish certain older students as club leaders, which are integral parts of the Vekllei schooling experience. Clubs operate independently of the school and often assist students in honing their expertise for higher education.</p>

<p>Thanks again for subscribing to this subreddit. I‚Äôm playing a game of chicken right now pitting my little Vekllei projects against my university work.</p>
<p>Vekllei boys uniforms (and school architecture) is coming later this week, turning Study Week into a Study Month!</p>
<p>Starting from next week, several exciting projects are getting kicked into gear. One is the graphic novel. There‚Äôs also the Vekllei wiki, which is under construction. There will be a lot more art. And a secret, special project that‚Äôs gonna be <em>really</em> exciting. I can‚Äôt wait to share it with you all.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/vekllei">I have a Patreon now</a> ‚Äî not that you need to donate! It‚Äôs like a priority inbox. If you want me to print out illustrations and send them to you, see drafts of upcoming projects (like the graphic novel script and preview the special secret), or you want a little drawing of your own, sending me a dollar is a good way get my attention. It just goes towards server costs and keeping me from malnutrition, nothing exciting.</p>
<p>So there‚Äôs a lot on the way. I know most shouldn‚Äôt care, but I get nervous if I‚Äôm not here every other day or so. And lurkers, just so you know ‚Äî Tzipora and I appreciate you.</p>
<p>On with Study Month.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/uniformideology.jpg"/> <p>Hello everyone. In celebration of the approach of exams (at least in the Southern Hemisphere), we turn our gaze north to Vekllei to celebrate Study Week. Every other day we‚Äôll be looking at education in Vekllei, and today we‚Äôre looking at uniforms.</p>
<p>Life in Vekllei is filled with uniforms for work and in study, for a various historical and cultural reasons. In the late 21st century, in a society where work is social, they help distinguish and professionalise employment, which grants important psychological and social benefits. Where a uniform might be employed for economic reasons in a country of poverty, or as a form of social control in schools, in Vekllei they are identifiers and champions of labour in a workplace or school.</p>
<p>For the students of Vekllei, a single uniform is distributed across all ages of schooling, from preschool right through university and miscellaneous higher education. For girls, it is highly modular and incorporates important cultural items of clothing, like the <em><strong>gi</strong></em> quarter-pleat, <strong>temple</strong> and <strong>fountain</strong> hairpieces, and overskirt lace aprons called <strong>sun petticoats</strong> (in ceremony). Although Vekllei was once cold year-round, today it sees warm summers and mild winters that encourage distinct summer and winter fashions. A girl‚Äôs preference in uniforms may cycle through many styles over her schooling years, from spartan minimalism in high school (of just an armband, white shirt and red skirt) to decadent ceremony in her university years.</p>
<p>In Vekllei Semaphore, the language of colour and shape, red and white imply both youth and energy (as well as sweetness, determinedness and purity depending on the context), and are often recognised as the national colours. In youth, it distinguishes education from traditional labour (in the literal, physical sense), which is communicated with navy blue.</p>
<p>High-quality uniforms are a marker of national pride, as indicators of national wealth after the shameful poverty of the First Atomic War‚Äôs fallout. To the people of Vekllei, an intricate and expensive uniform distributed amongst ordinary people greatly influences the national ego, and further contributes to Vekllei‚Äôs social and cultural isolation from the rest of the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, we‚Äôll be seeing how the boys compare. Then things will get a little more exciting.  Please let me know if you have any questions!</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/tattoos.jpg"/> <p>Where tattoos had once been an indication of class and work, they were now uncommon. Both class and work had been abolished. Tattoos were almost never seen in the prism of ordinary Vekllei life, but in less savoury occupations they were found where utopian concessions collide with violence and memory.</p>
<p>Baron rolled up his sleeves and laid them out for her. You could accuse him of many things ‚Äî he was a reticent bloke ‚Äî but he was never dishonest with Tzipora. She was as much a companion as a daughter, and he treated her with the respect he‚Äôd afford any close colleague or friend. His upper arm was marked with faded illustrations from a previous chapter of life. Most obvious was a dragon that looked like it had been done professionally, or at least by a comrade who‚Äôd had some experience. It was intricate and artful. The rest were simple words or illustrations, maybe done by the man himself. Holding her tongue about the dragon tattoo, which demanded attention in its colour and scale, she asked about three dots that matched the patterns of her shirt.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThose are for Amelie. I mentioned her, didn‚Äôt I? She was my sister ‚Äî she would have liked you, too. She had a strange sense of humour.‚Äù</p>
<p>They marked the grave of his sister who passed as a teen-ager from tuburculosis. It was a common outbreak in the poverty that followed the First Atomic War. She was fifteen ‚Äî the Vekllei lifespan is measured in sets of five. Beneath it was a dagger, or improvised military cross, listing the initials of two friends of his and his years of service. ‚ÄúAll done,‚Äù he told her, ‚Äúwhile black-out drunk.‚Äù</p>
<p>She asked about his friends, and where they were, and he told her he didn‚Äôt know. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true. That‚Äôs how service overseas goes sometimes. Look how long it took for me to get back here. I wouldn&rsquo;t recognise them.‚Äù He paused for a moment, and raised his eyebrows. ‚ÄúMost likely, they‚Äôre dead.‚Äù</p>
<p>Within the Chinese dragon, illustrated cleanly with improvised equipment, lay a history of sweltering heat and combat. This one was a soldier‚Äôs tattoo, proud and impossible to ignore. You don‚Äôt give much thought to scarring your skin if you‚Äôre about to die. She did not know how long he was there, or in what capacity, because he did not talk about his time in the army. She just knew he was young ‚Äî maybe a few years older than her.</p>
<p>She liked his tattoos. For the thirty years she would know him, he was outwardly a quiet and thoroughly unextraordinary man. He took part in no great pleasures except a glass of wine on Friday evenings and a movie with Zelda on Sunday. Not once did he ever raise his voice at her. He smoked occasionally, and a pipe on weekends. But when he rolled up his sleeves after supper to smoke his pipe, and watch the evening from their eighth-floor balcony, the snake climbing the dagger was visible on his forearm. And behind that dagger, and that snake, there was a filthy room in Ariquemes, and a baby‚Äôs cry, and blood. A sinister revelation settled on the room.</p>
<p>As Zelda would once explain, you might go to a friend‚Äôs party or parent-teacher, and all the other dads would see hers and think he looked like a professor or bank teller. She liked to think they gave no regard to him at all ‚Äî he looked like a quiet, pleasant, nothing-person. But if he reaches for his left sleeve and rolls it up, that all changes. He reveals himself to be a figure of death.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/showdown.jpg"/> <p>It is not uncommon for gangs to form in Vekllei, especially among immigrant communities otherwise marginalised by a complex logographic language and rigid belief system.</p>
<p>In fact, in a country of plenty, there is not much to otherwise identify with. Class is irrelevant in utopia, and the basic ideas of manhood and womanhood are being destroyed in hand with the abolishment of industry. Racial identifiers certainly exist ‚Äî the population is descended almost entirely from Scandinavian settlers (with notably fair hair) and those of mixed Inuit-Scandinavian ancestry, whom carry Caucasian features but have dark, often black, hair. There are also many Vekllei of immigrant heritage, largely from Eastern and Southern Europe after the First Atomic War. It is along these racial lines that bullying occurs in schools and atomised communities form.</p>
<p>In Montre, a university city of Northern Vekllei, it is not uncommon for these prejudices to fester. The capital may be cosmopolitan, but cities like Montre and Adouisneh are largely homogenous. Decades on from the First Atomic War, arguments between native Vekllei and children of Greek heritage continue to play out, usually in stupid and meaningless ways.</p>
<p>Cast against the racialised violence of the U.S. in the 2070s, and the Apartheid regime in South Africa, Vekllei&rsquo;s ethnic tensions would be incomprehensible. On the small, arctic island, however, they will slowly be buried as generations cycle on and the pleasures of common Vekllei life realise themselves. There is no room in Vekllei for anything but Vekllei ambitions, regardless of heritage.</p>

<p>From Tzipora‚Äôs notebook:</p>
<p>[A Guide to Magic, Chapter 2: The Witch]</p>
<p>The witches of Pachinki are an interesting affair ‚Äî many books have been dedicated to their research after discovery, yet so little is known about them. They are almost universally misandrists, which is understandable considering their present illegality and persecution in the subcontinents of Zen and Domos. They serve only themselves and individuals they happen to like, and spend most of their lives exploring the canyon between the chaos of nature‚Äôs fundamental frequencies and the power of human magic.</p>
<p>They are rumoured to be able to split their own minds. Using old spells long since lost to ordinary people in Zen, they are able to siphon their mental faculties into a trusted object ‚Äî usually a precious gem, and relegate essential functions of the brain to it. For example, a witch might siphon a tenth of her mental ability into a necklace, which then pushes out whatever consciousness exists within then carries on a witch‚Äôs essential functions ‚Äî respiration, blood circulation and pain are just a few of unconscious functions a witch might do away with.</p>
<p>Why would they do such a thing? Well, it is known to all people who have ever attempted magics that powerful spells force great stress on the mind. In fact, the more thorough the subsumption of the mind towards the spell, the better the results. By dispensing with her bodily functions, a witch is able to dedicate almost all of her mental power towards the task at hand, and since a brain operating without vital functions is a very stressed brain indeed, she can become extraordinarily powerful as a result.</p>
<p>Such magical efforts make perfect sense for people of power ‚Äî government workers, or traditional sorcerers ‚Äî but witches are far more interested exploration and discovery than they are power and conquest. So again ‚Äî why would they do such a thing?</p>
<p>Only recently has a possible answer to this question arisen. It is disarmingly straightforward ‚Äî witches are outcasts, and usually very lonely people. By siphoning enough of their own mind into a creature or pet, they replace the pet with a functioning copy of themselves. They are consequently able to make friends at will.</p>
<p>Such a process is incredibly dangerous ‚Äî although only a fraction of brainpower is required to make a functioning consciousness, they are in essence duplicating a human mind. To transplant a consciousness of human intuition into, say, a raven, requires powerful psychophysical drugs and gems of a correct frequency to stop a collapse of the mind (and subsequently render ten percent or so of the witch‚Äôs brain ability permanently nonfunctioning). Even upon a successful schism, her summoned consciousness is hardly a raven ‚Äî it is an anthropomorphic creature, of human mind and animal body.</p>
<p>Another fact of the witch, which may interest the reader, is that they do not decompose upon death. They are ordinary people in life, but ancient magic the likes of which is unobservable and unknowable keeps their body, intact or otherwise, totally preserved (though thoroughly dead). In kingdoms where witchcraft is a crime, you can find ‚Äúwitch towers‚Äù filled with the fresh, undead body parts of executed witches that will long outlive the grisly silos themselves‚Ä¶</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/mafioso.jpg"/> <p>Hello, everyone. It&rsquo;s been six days. I&rsquo;d like to have been here sooner, but I had the good fortune to leave my Apple Pencil in a hotel room in Sydney. Although delighted with my welcome and surprising expense (~$150AUD, or roughly 43 bacon and cheese pull-apart loaves), I&rsquo;ve consequently fallen behind with my off-daily illustrations.</p>
<p>However, I carry the ANZAC spirit deep within me, and I&rsquo;ve made use of my time. I have a document, many thousands of words long, detailing a special kind of script. <a href="https://imgur.com/lL3T32R">The writing is excellent.</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a hint &ndash; it&rsquo;s not for a film.</p>
<p>Thanks for sticking with me. I&rsquo;m back. In the meantime, please enjoy this illustration and story.</p>
<hr>
<p>When Moise arrived at the Desmoisnes&rsquo; to pick up Tzipora for the halloween festivities, he was greeted at the door by Baron, who looked tired and held a powder mirror in one hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hello, Moise,&rdquo; Baron said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, good. Say, Moise, could you tell Zelda she looks nice when you see her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Moise could ask, Zelda&rsquo;s voice rang out from behind her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him I&rsquo;ll be a moment! Just a moment!&rdquo; &ndash; like most Zeldaic exclamations, there was panic in it.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, he stepped inside her room to see her. She was dressed as a witch, and wore a cardboard hat fashioned in black linen on her head. Most immediately, however, he noticed she was wearing eye-liner and rouge. He&rsquo;d never seen her wear make-up before, because she looked too young to wear it. She was a teen-ager whose appearance made such feminine gestures a costume rather than daily practice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look really nice,&rdquo; Moise said. &ldquo;Have you done yer face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she beamed, &ldquo;you noticed! It&rsquo;s not done poorly is it? I&rsquo;ve got no practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nah, it looks great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t lying. She&rsquo;d gone a bit heavy since her lashes were so dark already, but she looked years older for it. Zelda wilted under any timid flattery and smiled genuinely at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I should wear it sometimes. It&rsquo;s not too much trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baron called from the living room: &ldquo;It took <em>two hours</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; she yelled, and after a moments of pause, followed with a kinder shout. &ldquo;Thanks for helping me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The festival went until the early hours of the morning. Cold city air washed over them in waves as they passed through warm clouds of woodsmoke from fires set out for hallow&rsquo;s eve. He was dressed in pinstripes as a Mafia don. He told her he had Mafia blood in him. Zelda asked if he was getting Greece confused with Italy, to which he took great offence. She started laughing as his fake moustache danced about on his upper lip when he corrected her, which made him more annoyed.</p>
<p>It was a nice night out, in the end.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/puffinscouts.jpg"/> <p>MoonMonth will return tomorrow. As an interlude&hellip;</p>
<hr>
<p>In Winter 2064, the changes made to the constitution of the <strong>Boy Scouts of America</strong> (BSA) would be felt around the scouting world. By this point it was pretty clear that the globe had entered a ‚Äúhelter skelter‚Äù decline towards tragedy. The emerging fission technologies were too slow and expensive to mass produce, and the fossil fuels that lighted homes around the world were starting to run dry.</p>
<p>It wasn‚Äôt just a crisis of resources ‚Äî there had been Taiwan, and the Commonwealth Wars, and the disaster of decolonisation. There was a long history of decline, paved in blood, and it was pretty clear that things were going to get worse before they got better. If they got better at all.</p>
<p>In Winter 2064, several clauses were introduced into BSA recruitment that would reposition the organisation as a fundamentally patriotic youth org, and would seek to raise a generation of the kinds of boys and girls America would need in the coming decades. They would have to be resourceful, capable and most of all, dutiful adults.</p>
<p>Chinese-born children were thereafter denied entry altogether, and those of immigrant heritage would be subject to allegiance testing. Over the course of a week and several indiscreet searches of the family political history, the BSA recruitment board would weed out communists and suspected agitators.</p>
<p>For an organisation of the prestige and heritage of the BSA to implement overt racial vetting meant that political repression was normalised ‚Äî so-called ‚Äúnational orthodoxy‚Äù ‚Äî in youth orgs around the world.</p>
<p>In Vekllei the largest youth organisations include</p>
<ol>
<li>The National Blossoms</li>
<li>The Puffin Scouts</li>
<li>The Landscape Bureau</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>National Blossoms</strong> concern themselves largely with traditional landcare and stewardship of national parks, and the <strong>Puffin Scouts</strong> are focussed on camping and friendship. The <strong>Landscape Bureau</strong> includes people of all ages, not just youth, and form part of Vekllei‚Äôs Parks and Heritage organisation (in which careers can be forged).</p>
<p>Although the constitutional reforms of the BSA, and subsequent militarisation of many European scouting organisations (as well as several so-called Western pockets of Asia), had little obvious effect on Vekllei‚Äôs youth orgs, subtle changes were made to better distinguish her domestic scouts from the rise of child fascism across the world. Parts of the uniform were demilitarised, and girls were allowed to wear skirts for the first time. The colours of the Puffin Scouts shifted from red and white, which is associated with the country as an identity, to gold and green, which better translate to ‚Äúwilderness‚Äù in Vekllei Semaphore. The political curriculum of the youth orgs (covering Upen, the Bureau System and the modern Vekllei city-state) was shifted to eighteen and above.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a scary time to be alive, but the children of Vekllei‚Äôs youth orgs are largely unaware of it outside of nuclear drills. Young scouts ‚Äî ranked as Pufflings in the Puffin Scouts ‚Äî spend their childhood years learning to tie knots and make friends, where the children of America are learning to shoot a rifle and memorise the dual constitutions; that of the Boy Scouts, and that of America.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the picture above, you&rsquo;ll notice a guide to decoding a simple Vekllei <em>Gi</em>, a type of ceremonial quarter-pleat, and a collection of items a Puffin Scout is likely to have on their person.</p>

<p>For Vekllei, a resource-poor island country with an insatiable demand for steel and uranium, extraterrestrial mining has allowed the country to fund projects of great national pride. These include the moon tourism programme, the Faroe military bases, and large atomic airships for work and pleasure.</p>
<p>The Copette Basin is a mountainous region far enough from Copette proper to launch rockets regularly. The flower-tundras that frame them are caught at once between the incomprehensibly ancient tectonic landscape and these visions of tomorrow. Old and new; agriculture and futurism ‚Äî these are marks of Vekllei&rsquo;s schizoid relationship with the present.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/moonwalk.jpg"/> <p><em>Welcome to MoonMonth, which started two days ago and will go until I‚Äôve said all I can say. These posts are going to work a little differently ‚Äî we‚Äôre going to follow Tzipora through her adventures in Moon City and beyond, and learn about the moon in this world along the way. Strap in!</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Vekllei has put a great deal of effort into developing infrastructure for tourism across the lunar surface of the Vekllei Moon Zone. For no cost except their labour in society, a Vekllei person is able to enjoy a handful of activities in Moidonnet (‚ÄúMoon City‚Äù), the largest and most recreational of the moon colonies. It is a complex of about a hundred connected buildings at the base of Mt Io, far away from the border territories of the Vekllei Moon Zone. On her 18th birthday, for which she still looked fourteen, Tzipora was gifted a week-long holiday in Moidonnet with her father, Baron, who surprised her with tickets.</p>
<p>Tzipora had never got to grips with flying. She was uneasy around most things too big for her immediate comprehension. The sky and the sea and space might be grand, but she was a small girl of a provincial disposition and was satisfied with a pocket of land and some people to talk to. She had taken pills for the flight to the moon, which climbed steeply and enjoyed several hours of zero gravity, but had calmed down by the time she‚Äôd acclimatised to the novelty of life in Moidonnet.</p>
<p>She was now in a room fretting over the equipment that would separate her person from millions of miles of empty vacuum. Around her was a pink preparation room with padded walls, typical of the confined spaces of Moon City. In this gravity it only took a stumble to send you careening into the air, and the cushioning would prevent you from cracking your head open. Along the walls were metal railings available to seize in the event you lose your balance.</p>
<p>The City was distinctive in its shoelessness, as it was easy to float in the low gravity of the moon and kick things that should not be kicked. It made the whole place feel quite scientific and homely at the same time ‚Äî like all tourists here were fellow travellers in some great expedition, too familial to bother with formalities like shoes.</p>
<p>A heavy atmospheric suit was suspended by its lifelines to the roof. It was bulky and had strange shiny booties at the feet. Nearby were moon boots, which would be sealed along with the rest of the suit in a vacuum cocoon before test depressurisation in the airlock. The International Standard flag was hung on the wall, probably to impress foreign tourists. There were a handful of foreign tourists visiting, usually relatives of Vekllei citizens. Occasionally you saw obviously wealthy foreigners who‚Äôd payed their own way. They were easy to spot, for their gold rings and nice clothes looked absurd and tacky in the face of the glory of Vekllei infrastructure.</p>
<p>There was no appetite for skirts in Moon City. The risks were too great. She‚Äôd changed out of trousers into a stiff jumpsuit bleached white with cleaning chemicals. Now that the domestic conventions of getting changed had been completed successfully, the weight of her adventure finally dawned on her. She took a seat and looked between the helmet and the body of the atmospheric suit, and felt her stomach drop. All of a sudden she missed Baron very dearly. Where had he got to?</p>
<hr>
<p>Next time, we‚Äôll look at rockets. See you soon!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Like most Vekllei people, Tzipora has visited the moon. From Ground Control on Earth in the district of Huay, Vekllei operates many moonbases, domes, research facilities and tourist opportunities in the moon‚Äôs southern hemisphere within a large complex called Moidonnet ‚Äî Moon City. It sits a hundred kilometres south of Mt Io (called Malapert Mountain in the West) in the Vekllei Moon Zone. It receives shuttles several times throughout the day.</p>
<p>The first time Zelda visited the moon was as a birthday gift from her father, who hadn‚Äôt been in many years. She recalls reading extensively about the moon in preparation for the trip.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚Äú‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs hoping, then. So we‚Äôve booked for three nights up in Moidonnet, and then a single night in Traismadonnet, a smaller city closer to the equator. I wanted us to do as many things as possible, so I think we should visit the peak of Io Mountain today, where they say they have a spectacular bio-dome and you can see forever, and maybe go on a space-walk. We‚Äôll see. Spacewalks are hard to book ahead for, but if we get tired we can just do everything else the next day.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs also an art gallery built for low gravity. It‚Äôs amazing, like a rubber castle, filled with sculpture and room pieces that are ‚Äî well, they‚Äôre just amazing. You‚Äôre always telling me I‚Äôm too skinny. Guess how much I‚Äôll weigh on the moon?‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúTwenty kilos?‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúJust under ten,‚Äù she smiled, and then laughed at the idea. ‚ÄúYou could pick me up and throw me.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>For the rest of September I‚Äôll be looking at Vekllei space tourism. There&rsquo;s a lot to cover, so stay tuned!</strong></p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/introducingayn.jpg"/> <p>The daughter of a Soviet expat and Hong Konger deckhand, <strong>Ayn</strong> <strong>Rumouisen</strong> has never stepped foot outside of Vekllei. A serious fear of flying and the open ocean has hedged her appetite for travel for all of her thirty-two years. She is well respected as an operations consultant within the Americas Bureau at National Intelligence (AB/NI), and is close with the ABNI Operations Director <strong>Baron Desmoisnes</strong> and Vekllei‚Äôs first ‚ÄúGregori Baby,‚Äù <strong>Tzipora &ldquo;Zelda&rdquo; Desmoisnes</strong>.</p>
<p>She‚Äôs known Baron, Tzipora‚Äôs father, for nigh twenty years. They met when she was eighteen, both as cadets in Vekllei‚Äôs combat intelligence programme. They dated for a few years before the requirements of intelligence work forced them apart. Baron was sent to South America for nearly a decade, and Ayn stayed behind in the Monitoring &amp; Preparations Department where she published work in the classified journals about events relevant to ABNI. She was also an associate contributor to the ‚ÄúImport Strangle‚Äù theoretical model, which has proven successful at plotting the collapse of major U.S. employers (like U.S. Steel in 2065 and Chrysler in 2068) for use in Vekllei foreign policy.</p>
<p>Baron and Ayn exemplify quiet, uncinematic mateship ‚Äî people satiated by occasional company and mutual respect, satisfied by their intermittent time together. After Tzipora‚Äôs adoption, Baron, now approaching his forties, returned to work as a senior director for the Americas Bureau, and soon found himself in Ayn‚Äôs professional orbit. In doing so, he introduced a nervous young satellite called Tzipora to her.</p>
<p>Tzipora adores Ayn. Ayn is everything Tzipora wants to be. She is even-tempered but strong-willed, graceful but not girlish, fiercely intelligent but pleasantly social. Where Baron is a product of his years in America and is totally professionalised at home and at work, Ayn has enjoyed life in Vekllei and is well-rounded and sweet. It was a shock for Tzipora to see Baron and Ayn in a photograph from their cadetship. Baron straddled a motorcycle, and did not wear spectacles. He was well-built and rough-looking. Ayn was a slender Asian woman dressed in slacks and a sunhat. Ayn today looked very much similar. Baron, in his beard and white-speckled hair, looked like an entirely different person.</p>
<p>Tzipora and Ayn share a hardship in their infertility despite a desire to have children ‚Äî Ayn suffered from endometriosis for many decades and is incapable of pregnancy. In all ways, Baron‚Äôs reluctant decision to adopt Tzipora was a wonderful blessing ‚Äî it brought old friends closer together and gave Ayn a daughter. For Tzipora, whose memories of her biological mother were bittersweet and muddied with time, Ayn was a breath of womanhood and light-heartedness in a household that contained only a single hard-working middle-aged man and his teen-age daughter.</p>
<p>Since Baron‚Äôs immediate family is dead, Tzipora is close with Ayn‚Äôs parents in the North of Vekllei and they‚Äôve taken to her as a granddaughter. Although Ayn and Baron are not married, and may never marry (although Tzipora gauges his response at least once a year), their lives are so thoroughly entwined that it is not uncommon that Baron will return home to Ayn and Tzipora preparing dinner together. In fact, Ayn is the reason Tzipora is such a good cook. Love takes many forms, and Tzipora enjoys several of them.</p>
<p><em>Normal programming will resume presently. Thanks for your patience everyone.</em></p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/fishing.jpg"/> <p>In the quaint ocean country of Vekllei, during their years of fecundity and fun, the calendar is divided into twelve festivals of various celebration and purpose. They include the <a href="/posts/2020-06-01-fission/"><strong>Festival of the Sea</strong></a> in October, which celebrates Vekllei‚Äôs vast fishing navy and concludes with the detonation of a nuclear weapon off Vekllei‚Äôs coast, to the <strong>Festival of the Moon</strong> in January, which is quiet and acknowledged only through personal ceremony and decorations.</p>
<p>One of the most important festivals in the country‚Äôs animistic spiritualism, called Upen, is the Festival of Fasting. It is not a traditional fast ‚Äî you are permitted to eat as much as you like. Instead, the Tesmosnen festival asks participants to either reject meat or hunt it for the duration of the festival.</p>
<p>Although by no means mandatory, during January you‚Äôll begin to notice restaurants alter their menus and youth organisations train to hunt during the festival weeks. There is an important cultural reason that usurps the largely spiritual origins of the festival ‚Äî fasting or killing forces you to acknowledge, as a consumer, the cycles of production and consumption at a most basic level. In Vekllei, which seeks a return to preindustrial lifestyles, modernisation largely abolishes the previously intimate relationship a common person had with agriculture.</p>
<p>As a mountainous island country, Vekllei must import the majority of its red meat, and shortages are common in rural areas. Although polls show that Vekllei prefers fish as its meat of choice, it is undeniable that consumption of red meat has increased tenfold over the last few decades.</p>
<p>During the three weeks of the festival, Vekllei people, including older children, are encouraged to fish or hunt as personal recreation or through environmental organisations. The act of killing and cleaning better illustrates the servile relationship the Earth now has with voracious human appetite, and this relationship forms in part the total Upen worldview.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/fatlip.jpg"/> <p>For the first six months Baron had known her, Zelda was a serious and wisened young woman who carried symptoms of her troubled past as gracefully as anyone ever could. Poverty ages a person, and she‚Äôd nurtured a calm and dispirited disposition. She did not like war films or books with unhappy endings, or loud noises or arguments. She dressed conservatively and spoke quietly and uncontroversially. She had lived a lifetime already, working in exploitation in motels and supermarkets, watching as Utah unraveled around her. She was an immigrant and uneducated, homeless and independent, and so by the time she arrived in Vekllei she was ready to settle down and live quietly.</p>
<p>Watching her psyche attempt to reconcile her sombre nature with her desire to be normal and socialise with people her own age was heartbreaking. She had this pathetic, mythical idea of normal girlish life, and it took her a long time to figure out that teen-age life worked differently from films. She had a group of people she hung around, but always on the periphery. She was blatantly disposable and socially innocent, and so she carried on pretending she could somehow rework her own image into the mythologised Coca-Cola teen dream she‚Äôd clung to since California.</p>
<p>Eventually, the idea fell apart. Where she was mousy and pitiful as a school-girl, as Zelda she was uncompromising and principled. As bullying got worse, and her school friends came to resent the parasitic relationship she&rsquo;d worked her way into, things eventually came to a head and the whole thing came crashing down. She got beat up pretty bad, and ruined a new school shirt, but Zelda had fought tougher creatures than Vekllei schoolgirls and she was suspended for the rest of the semester.</p>
<p>Eventually, Zelda would figure out that she never really needed or wanted the sort of bubbly teen-age friends she‚Äôd imagined. Zelda was, after all, not that bubbly or teen-age. Throughout her life, her closest friends were always those that required nothing and gave her space. That was how she liked to be; loved and shown affection, but left to her own devices.</p>

<p>This sprawling rail network is ubiquitous with the Vekllei landscape, where images of simple agricultural life coincide with a train or tram. They are among the most beloved services of Vekllei society, from the vehicles themselves to the people that run them. Almost every precious memory and significant occasion of Vekllei life is preceded by a trip on the train.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve posted another painting of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/busvvn/catching_a_steam_locomotive_to_school/">Vekllei trains here</a>.

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/lola.jpg"/> <p><em>Editor&rsquo;s note: this article, while ready for reading, is still under construction.</em></p>
<p>Considering both the length and convoluted terminology that embroil this project, there was only so long I could carry on before people started getting lost. The truth of it is that Vekllei is not a particularly complex or difficult project to summarise, despite the snapshot &ldquo;lore in scenes&rdquo; approach that kneecaps a complete understanding. I&rsquo;m just lazy.</p>
<p>In fact, Vekllei is not a particularly challenging idea. It is unique, but some days that&rsquo;s about all it has going for it. The word itself ‚Äî <strong>Vekllei</strong> ‚Äî refers to both the landscape and the people of an island we know as Iceland. This project looks at that country and its people across a span of about fifty years, mostly between 2070 and 2120. As an alt-history, timelines diverge between our world and theirs in the 1940s, although Vekllei&rsquo;s history is much older.</p>
<p><em>Vekllei is utopia, but Vekllei is not perfect</em>. It is constructed under a framework of <em>utopie concr√®te</em>, where dreamlike landscapes and characters collide with the dirt and dysfunction of reality. To some people, the contradictions and imperfection of Vekllei society would disqualify it as utopia, especially in an orthodox understanding of the idea, but Western cultural orthodoxy is not the metric used by a Vekllei person.</p>
<p>Vekllei people instead use Vekllei cultural metrics, and to a Vekllei person it is the patina of things ‚Äî its imperfections and tragedy ‚Äî that recognise the beauty in life itself, as markers of both existence and usefulness. This cultural intuition is a central tenant of <strong>Upen</strong>, Vekllei&rsquo;s nondenominational animism and universal spirituality.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Vekllei is undeniably heavenly. It is a gorgeous country of spiritual satisfaction and earnest friendship. Your first day in Vekllei is a dizzying spiritual experience. The weight of the world seems to shift, and then rise off your shoulders. Colour and vitality disentangle themselves from injustice and consumption and pivot to meet you. Food is good and free, strangers are friendly and bursting with lively purposefulness.</p>
<p>Vekllei understands itself as a city-state. This colours a lot of how Vekllei people think of themselves. In practice, there are many distinct &lsquo;cities&rsquo; ‚Äî the Capital, Little Vekllei, Copette, Ro, Montre and Adouisneh are the largest of them ‚Äî but they are not recognised as such or federated in Vekllei geographic lexicon. Vekllei is a single continuous neighbourhood, circling nearly the entire coast of their island. Vekllei is also the land on which they sit, which predates the country by millions of years and informs many principles of Upen, which go on to manifest in public policy.</p>
<p>Vekllei cities are almost entirely built according to a single architectural school, <strong>Newda</strong>, which manifests in many different ways but is almost always obviously a flavour of midcentury modernism. Water and concrete define Vekllei cities.</p>
<p>The Vekllei flag is an unornamented purplish red, known as the &lsquo;Domestic Standard&rsquo;. Internationally, they employ a highly decorated flag called the &lsquo;International Standard,&rsquo; which features both the <em>Oa</em> national flower (and omnipresent symbol in every corner of society) and Vekllei logographic script, called <em>Topet</em>.</p>
<p>Vekllei has five language systems, which contribute to the single national language &ndash; also called Vekllei. There is spoken Vekllei,  <strong>Topet</strong> (logographic Vekllei script), <strong>Rapotenne</strong> (name-script), <strong>Vekllei semaphore</strong>, and <strong>Potenne</strong> (hand-talk) or <strong>Upotenne</strong> (spirit-hand-talk). Potenne is a sign language used with or in place of speech, and Upotenne is a way of manifesting physical runes specifically.</p>
<p>Vekllei cities are very colourful, because colour has great meaning. You can construct sentences using only colour and shapes through Vekllei semaphore.</p>
<p>This sort of lifestyle is possible because of Vekllei&rsquo;s abolishment of work, commodity and consumption. In the case of Vekllei, this means that people do not use money and work only for personal benefit, as both ways of actualising themselves and keeping useful or socialising. Not all work is equally difficult or interesting, but everyone must work in fairness. For some, that means as little as a few hours a week copy-editing neighbourhood newsletters. For others, they may work weeks without days off. The consequence of this is that value and products are valueless in any real sense, as post-scarcity relegates the functioning Vekllei economy to autonomous overproduction and waste.</p>
<p>The question of why people work is not an especially difficult one. In Vekllei, where money has not existed for a long time and generations are raised without it, basic premises of motivation have been reconsidered. Life in Vekllei is mostly a largely individual march towards actualisation, through several avenues of pleasure. There is the enjoyment of food and culture, the intimacy of love and marriage, the heritage in family and blood, and the power of work and professional legacy. Only a handful of these contribute to the pleasure of work, but in a society that has mostly done away with menial work through automation and advanced robotics, pleasure is mostly what you make of it. In Vekllei, this is called <strong>Product Socialism</strong>, an inaccurate nominer that describes both the bureau system of work and distribution and Vekllei&rsquo;s fundamental syndicalism. In politics, it is called <strong>Sundress Municipalism</strong>.</p>
<p>The quality of life for almost any other person in today&rsquo;s world, however, has declined slowly by nearly any metric. People are, on average, poorer and hungrier than they were fifty years ago. Various contradictions ‚Äî in startling contrast to Vekllei&rsquo;s own schisms ‚Äî have left previously dignified superpowers in disorienting cycles of bloodshed and madness. In the U.S., a large number of confederate states have reasserted their sovereignty following the collapse of the Ford Motor Company and the Northrop corporation. Cultural reforms in Red China have left vast wings of the CCP disatissfied with current leadership, with whispers of a coup. Western Europe has rediscovered her reactionary heritage and indulged in a serious of increasingly authoritarian traditionalist movements, and the export economy of the Soviet Union has collapsed after the shift towards atomic fuels. Vekllei rejects millions of applications for asylum each year.</p>
<p>The circumstance of the world is only made more tragic by the relative peace and stability of Vekllei, and the simplicity and carefree lifestyle of the average Vekllei person. Vekllei has the most flowers per capita of any country in the world. The last fifty years has seen the melting of much of the poles and the the introduction of el nino summers and instant winters that wrack Germany, Austria, Italy, and much of temperate Europe. The Adriatic seems to see more gloom than mediterranean sun these days. The equatorial deserts of the world, Nevada included, are mere degrees away from unsurvivable. With temperatures frequently breaking 50C (125F) throughout the year, it thins the population of Southerners too old or too poor to avoid the heat. North Africa is a husk. There is no water and no food. There is a reason there are mass graves all across the shores of the Black Sea, and why Europe tastes the boot. There is a reason the southern African states are crumbling.</p>
<p>In Vekllei, with her extreme daylight cycles and polar latitude, the weather has improved significantly. Summers are warm enough to host outdoor activities for much of the season and winters are milder than previously, rarely dropping below freezing. Vekllei life, in its insular fashion, has been somewhat improved by the destabilisation of the climate. Lush temperate rainforests cover much of its lowlying basins, and rich volcanic soils spoil agricultural endevour in the warm seasons.</p>
<p>Vekllei&rsquo;s current prosperity has enabled the country to embark on her final project. The benefits of industrialisation and contemporary post-scarcity are employed in a serious effort to reestablish localised, agrarian life built upon the unit of the community.</p>
<p>Vekllei understands the the achievements of industry as a liberationist tool to return to preindustrial, satisfying life. It is not as though the country will abolish three centuries of tremendous progress ‚Äî quite the contrary, in fact. But understood through petticoat ideology, the marriage of labour and the ordinary person can only occur through self-satisfying, personal work. This is in contrast, one can suppose, to mechanised, industrial labour to which we owe our enormous wealth. To a Vekllei person, work is social, productive, creative and satisfying. The simple pleasures of agriculture; specialised craftsman and tradesman; artistry ‚Äî these are the fruits only of a society that can afford them, since they necessitate the deindustrialisation of agriculture, factory manufacturing and mass media simultaneously.</p>
<p>So even though Vekllei is by all measures an industrial society; a land of helijets and plenty; the people of this country see automation as the deindustrialisation of society, at least culturally ‚Äî a return to community employment, decentralised agriculture and tending of the land.</p>
<p>Vekllei is a fundamentally female country. This is what <strong>petticoat society</strong> means. There are plenty of men in it, and quite distinct social constructs for men and women exist in a way that distinguishes the country from traditional progressive projects, but the feminisation of the economy and politics remains. Vekllei economic gender theory understands masculinity as first and foremost a  value to be consumed in industrial society, in a perverse sort of value exchange. Men are first commodified and then broken through work, killed in wars, are suffocated emotionally, and so forth. The very premise of  manhood, as the 1950s understands it (which this world is very much immersed in) is not just a biological or social construct, but an economic one. As Vekllei progresses, and erases these identifiers of masculinity, men will become female first in an economic sense (in a process called economic feminisation), and will eventually become females socially also. These are gender constructs that are essentially still prescribed by traditional Vekllei values, but are tied to the  deindustrialisation of the country. The perfect Vekllei society is one in which the man dies with the machine.</p>
<p>Although Vekllei is not a traditional egalitarian experiment, and is often a land of absurd contradiction in Western political tradition, Vekllei women enjoy a society built for them. Womanhood in the country is not defined by commodity or appearance, but by ideas the culture associates with womanhood ‚Äî compassion, bravery, intelligence, grace, etc. They are defined not by their relationships or their economic circumstance, but by their friends, political opinions, ability, etc. The decommodification of society has also decommodified womanhood. Vekllei is not simply a good place to be a woman, but is in fact a female country.</p>
<p>Finally, you might have notices a certain set of recurring characters. The girl with short dark hair is Tzipora Desmoines, the character of utopia in this project. Her adoptive father, Baron, is bearded and wears half-framed spectacles. Her friend, Cobian, wears round spectacles and her hair in a ponytail. Their mutual friend, Moise, is heavy-set and has curly hair. Together, they represent a broad demographic of Vekllei people. Baron is descended from Nordic caucasians; vikings from Vekllei&rsquo;s initial settlement. Tzipora and Cobian are descended from both inuits and Scandinavians, in the population explosion that followed Inuit settlement in the Danish territory. Moise is descended from Greek immigrants in the tide of immigration that followed the immediate postwar era. Although there are Vekllei people of colour, they make up a minority of the population.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this guide has helped to introduce you to the world in which Vekllei is situatated. I&rsquo;m likely to expand in the coming days on this section, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>It is a world of nuclear power, gingham and moon colonisation wrapped in the aesthetic of the 50s/60s. There&rsquo;s a lot of poverty and suffering in it, but also tremendous hope. Vekllei is utopia.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/shadow.jpg"/> <p>Zelda, for all her outward timidity and mousiness, was mostly self-assured. In the same way that a child is self-assured, in which there is no real epistemology of the self as adults know it. Zelda never grew up to become a real teen-ager, after all ‚Äî her body is forever thirteen-and-a-half, despite her mature and maternal disposition ‚Äî and so she had a reckless sort of confidence that never really doubted the premise of her existence.</p>
<p>She did have many weaknesses, however, and she was very conscious of them. They were almost too many to count. The biggest of them, aside from her blatant neurodivergences, was her inability to keep weight on. In her first few months in Vekllei, her skinny frame was symptomatic of her malnourishment in the States. Then, as she struggled to stay above thirty kilos, it became a question of eating habits. Finally, the question was asked ‚Äî did she have some sort of problem, here? And if so, was it something to do with Gregori syndrome, the comfortable answer? Or was it something more complex ‚Äî perhaps an eating disorder?</p>
<p>Aside from her small portions, she did not indicate much in common with other girls her age who struggled with image. In fact, much of physical self-loathing was directed at her thinness, which only emphasised her childish lack of figure and breastlessness. The only times Zelda ever cried over a mirror was when she saw her own scrawny frame that a healthy diet should have been able to remedy. Yet even when she pushed herself, and choked down a second serving, it seemed to hardly make a difference. It was a cycle that would haunt her for a long time, until the age when Gregori women must learn to accept their girlishness in place of traditional ideas of beauty.</p>
<p>Whatever the case may have been, Zelda has never weighed more than forty kilos except in a winter coat, and she can still count her ribs in bath. What has changed ‚Äî in a most wonderful way that alleviates much of her suffering ‚Äî is her ability to love herself, and understand the limitations of her condition. Considering the fact that she has done so much, and despite her childlessness has mothered many boys and girls to adulthood, priorities shift and the importance of beauty fades. She spends more time today being the best Zelda she can be rather than worrying about her image. After all, image is a loser‚Äôs game in the life of a Gregori baby. Happiness is only ever found within.</p>

<p>On her days off from her place of work in the village library, Zelda would descend the slope of the village into a great basin of creeks and flower-tundra. In the summer, when it was warm enough to sit in the sun, you could sit at one end of the valley and admire the wind rushing to meet you as it whipped through fields of flowers. For a few moments you could admire yourself for what you were ‚Äî a small being in a landscape as old as the Earth. It put certain things in perspective. Some people needed to go out and look for a place that would finally make everything make sense. But, Zelda thought, sometimes you could reach the corners of the Earth and still stay where you are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no greater struggle in a Vekllei person‚Äôs life than that with themselves. Work, like recreation and indeed like consumption itself, is social in this country. Most ordinary material whims of a person can be satisfied in a matter of hours, depending on the nearest station‚Äôs timetable. A handful of dreams are also accessible ‚Äî a trip to the moon, for instance, is a matter of writing the Moon Office and waiting to receive tickets.</p>
<p>Without money, there is not much by way of commodity. And without commodity, the premises of life and identity have to be interrogated. A cultural intuition that hasn‚Äôt been seen in developed countries since before the industrial revolution has reawakened, and with it come uneasy existential questions.</p>
<p>What are we doing here, on this planet? What am <em>I</em> doing here? How do I come to terms with the fact that everything is either moving away from or moving towards nothingness?</p>
<p>Where the pit of material desire sits in other nationalities, the Vekllei person has a great deal of social anxiety. This phenomenon has only become more severe now that recovery from the Great Atomic War is nearly complete and Vekllei‚Äôs security in the world is mostly assured. Life for most people now engages with their immediate surrounds ‚Äî family, community, and love.</p>
<p>While any combinations of these things can actualise a person, and even rehabilitate the directionless, it doesn‚Äôt work out like that for everyone. Family bonds often sever; communities can be transitory; love is elusive. Even with these things, the question of purpose is more pertinent than ever before, as the whole world approaches a reality without human labour. Just what is it that makes life worth living?</p>
<p>This explains, in part, why Vekllei people may not be much happier for all their enormous collective wealth. Despite the richness of their culture, optimism for their future and satisfaction with their conditions, none of these things properly emancipate the heart of utopia from its existential question ‚Äî is it possible to automate humanity right out of humans?</p>
<p>When Vekllei people meet that golden horizon, and cross that rubicon, what waits for human intuition on the other side? Will it be endless days of poolsides and dinner parties? Or will it destroy the soul of our animalistic origins ‚Äî leaving us desperate for value as useful people, and our purpose in work? Whatever the case may be, Vekllei is rapidly approaching it.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/introducingmoise.jpg"/> <p>Moise was a fat kid who went to another school. Zelda only knew him from the tram, where he carried a criminal stigma because of his rumoured gang affiliations. He was a second-generation Vekllei boy of immigrant Greek heritage. There were a few ethnic gangs in his area, and most immigrant boys that didn‚Äôt do well in school quickly found other causes to fight for.</p>
<p>Zelda quickly antagonised the boy by offering him to her own bullies. She would point out his weight and he‚Äôd point out her clumsy Vekllei language skills and apparent lack of intelligence commonly attributed to foreigners, and so the arms race began.</p>
<p>Bullying did not come naturally to either of them, since they were on the receiving end most of the time and were not particularly manipulative. She would tell Moise he stunk, he would say she was skeletal and unattractive, and they‚Äôd seethe about each other that evening. She would make fun of him for eating a chocolate on the tram, and he stole a hairclip and wouldn‚Äôt give it back.</p>
<p>One day she was walking behind him after alighting the tram and had set to whacking him with her bookbag, demanding the return of her red pencil. She kept pushing him. In a fit of anger he slammed her against a garage door repeatedly, where her head bounced against the corrugated steel and nearly knocked her out. He left her incapacitated on the pavement, and fled.</p>
<p>He buzzed her apartment the following evening after school, seeking to apologise. She weighed her own crimes against his attack, using unique Zelda metrics that gauged physical and emotional violence somewhat improportionately. She accepted his apology.</p>
<p>Thus began the kind of awkward and unconventional friendship that Zelda seemed to attract. With entrepreneurial zeal she rarely displayed, she struck a deal with Moise ‚Äî he would teach her to fight, and she would help him lose weight. He did not have much experience talking to girls, which was both revealing and endearing, but it helped that Zelda was socially maladjusted and not particularly girlish. On weekends he would take her to the nearest park, they‚Äôd lay out a blanket, remove their shoes, and he‚Äôd show her how to use a bigger opponent‚Äôs weight against them. During the week, she‚Äôd meet him at the tram station and they‚Äôd go for long walks until he was red and puffing. Zelda liked making food, which seemed to be the one thing she was good at, and soon after began preparing his school lunches, which she‚Äôd pass surreptitiously on the morning tram.</p>
<p>Although they grew close, they both recognised her condition would make any romantic relationship inappropriate and so they remained each other‚Äôs quiet soulmates as he went on to film school and married. Moise‚Äôs wife, an incredibly patient woman of enormous spiritual strength, would soon learn to tolerate Zelda‚Äôs presence at their life occasions. Although Zelda would often think about what might have been if she‚Äôd only been normal, they remained close for the rest of his life and she would remain a close family member and guardian of his children for decades after his passing.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/supermarket.jpg"/> <p>In Vekllei, the economy is a social organ that lingers awkwardly between cultural and political interests. On one hand, the country is regressing (both politically and culturally) towards deindustrialised, decommodified life. On the other, it is irreversibly equipped with the benefits of automation and robotics, rendering large swathes of the labour-force obsolete. Work is now, for most purposes, a creative organ that facilitates society, culture and technology. This has led to a society not unlike most planned economies, in which employment is both essential and unnecessary, leading to vast wastage and consumption at scales a market would see as horrifically inefficient but in Vekllei is understood as an enormous social benefit. Some people must still work ‚Äî so everyone must work in fairness. In Vekllei, employment is casual and often unrecorded except by the syndicates, as per the foundations of Sundress Municipalism. As long as you are working, studying or otherwise justifying a life in Vekllei (raising your children or training for competitions, perhaps), then you‚Äôll be left alone to do what you like.</p>
<p>Since everyone must work, there are many archaic jobs in Vekllei, especially for those still figuring out what they want to do with their lives. The supermarket now rules across most of the world, but in Vekllei there are only a handful of chains with few stores, simply because the provincial self-interest of Sundress Municipalism is sympathetic to individual stores populated by a community, rather than chains. The corner grocer is king.</p>
<p>Since these supermarkets are often built in imitation of the west, and are remarkably un-Vekllei, the largest three chains are illustrated above for your benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Comen Grocer</strong> is the only pre-Atomic War supermarket company in Vekllei, and offers mostly special-interest or foreign products. It actually operates under the same retail bureau that runs the <strong>Farmer‚Äôs Syndicate</strong>, but is independent. It is run by a board of representatives from each store, whom are elected. Roman here has platinum hair and is a good example of an ethnically Scandinavian Vekllei person, who has descendants dating back to the 11th century.</p>
<p><strong>Joyloaf</strong> operates in the Lola district of Vekllei‚Äôs capital, and is a popular day job for artistic young women who otherwise do not have the means or time to socialise with people their own age. It started as a bakery in 2064 but has since grown to stock many different kinds of foods. It is quite fashionable in Lola, and appears in cultural material originating from that district (as seen in several comics and films). Tzipora has dark hair and a round face, but blue eyes and fair skin. She is a descendent of both Inuits and Scandinavians, making her a member of the second-largest ethnic group in Vekllei.</p>
<p>The <strong>Farmer‚Äôs Syndicate</strong> is both a name and a description of Vekllei‚Äôs <em>venrouive</em> food retail arm, which means that it is beholden to the direction of the country and would be the organisation called upon to provide rations in the event of war. It is a collective of agricultural villages and organisations and operates as a distributor of these products directly. It almost exclusively stocks Vekllei products, as well as ‚Äúitems of cultural significance‚Äù that are traditionally eaten in ceremony and ritual, but are otherwise most popular with Vekllei‚Äôs elderly population. The Farmer‚Äôs Syndicate is the largest supermarket chain in Vekllei, but very few of its stores are actually supermarkets ‚Äî many individual grocers <em>senrouive</em> business operate under the Syndicate‚Äôs structure, but often do not brand themselves as such.</p>
<p>Supermarkets are fundamentally a novelty in Vekllei, which has a vibrant cafe reputation and in which most food prepared at home is grown locally. Food production is a very important part of Vekllei culture and Upen, and the desacralising effect of chains are symptoms of an industrial, globalised society. This is an unattractive proposition to a country rapidly approaching isolationist pre-industry, in which the cycles of production and consumption are both visible and important.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/cherry.jpg"/> <p>A road trip around Vekllei in the summer is an experience that makes life worth living. In some ways, it is a spiritual detox than reinvigorates a person with the intimate, elusive premise of the Vekllei spiritual enlightenment. In others, it is a way of returning to the earth, and understanding the human place in the principles of <a href="/factbook/society/culture/religion/">Upen</a>.</p>
<p>No matter your intention, be it holiday or rediscovery, the very best of Vekllei is on display. Liberated of the desacralising effect of routine, the villages and factories you‚Äôll zoom past take on new and extraordinary light. Removed from it, you see better how society works. The complex web of logistics, from roaring trains on adjacent rail lines to squinting at a passing nuclear flying wing through the sun roof, are now aesthetic indications of petticoat society.</p>
<p>The All-Atomic Auto Company betrays its name instantly by not offering a single reactor-powered vehicle in its entire catalogue. Indeed, commercial reactors are so heavy that they are only realistically mounted in truck frames, even in Vekllei‚Äôs insensitivity to cost. You simply cannot fit a fission reactor into a small auto. At least, not yet. In fact, in countries where costs are concern, it is feasible that reactor technology as we currently understand it will never be economical in the frame of a small auto.</p>
<p>The AAAC is actually an industrial concern of several Vekllei venrouive bureaus negotiating commercial atomics with the future. These include famous companies like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/a64ahs/the_cosmojet/">General Reactor</a>, which are at the forefront of global reactor technology and compete directly with Raytheon, and Common Battery. Several lesser known, unglamorous companies also contribute to the cooperative concern. Astrotransmissions supply transmissions and Montre-Rayon Foundry provide composite steels. The AAAC has an internal design house, but most of its staff are poached from appliance manufacturers.</p>
<p>The result are a series of small, playful cars with colourful paints and a friendly look. They‚Äôre sleek and fun without being toylike, and recall remarkable household appliance designs like Fettener Kettles or Vekllei Supernational television sets. Although AAAC autos are not yet atomic, they are almost entirely electric and fueled by Vekllei‚Äôs atomic and geothermal plants, legitimising the concern‚Äôs name partially.</p>
<p>The flagship of AAAC is the Cherry, the first mass-market vehicle the company has brought to international market. Several stereotypical errors were made introducing it to the non-Vekllei world, including the unusual name and even more unusual tagline ‚Äî ‚ÄúThe Future Car for an Eternal Summer.‚Äù In Vekllei, summer is a feminine, fragrant season of warmth and rebirth. The way it was transliterated makes it seem like a reference to the world‚Äôs <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/c21zvo/hot_summers_in_the_arctic_and_newda_architecture/">rapidly destabilising climate and ecosystem</a>, which is inching the globe towards economic collapse.</p>
<p>The car was a flop in the States, but saw moderate success in Europe. In Vekllei, it is one of the most common cars you‚Äôll find in autopools today and is a favourite among road-trippers circumnavigating Vekllei‚Äôs diverse coast.</p>

<p>In Vekllei, where a military service of four years is mandatory between the ages of 18 and 32, the purpose of conscription is twofold; first, to ensure the citizenry is at least lightly trained should an invasion follow <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/auz580/the_forgotten_generation/">a nuclear strike</a>, and second; to ensure that important jobs in the country that are not easily automated are always filled.</p>

<p>The garden battalions are not simply the pacifist‚Äôs way out ‚Äî there are many other jobs for principled people. Instead, they appeal mostly to those nearing the end of their eligible conscription age who are looking to get service out of the way before family-making or major career advancement.</p>
<p>In this sense, conscription for most Vekllei people is a rite of passage that mimics preindustrial ritual, and otherwise defines the transition to adulthood in a country that has largely desegregated aged schooling. It is one of the few times in a Vekllei persons‚Äô life in which the organs of power of the country will interfere directly with their lives, making conscription a welcome structure for young Vekllei boys n gals not yet sure what to do with their lives. Indeed, many of the roles taken on during service will echo throughout their working lives, as gardeners become council planners and labourers become robotics engineers.</p>
<p>The truth of automation and work as pleasure is that the unfettered freedom and hedonism of the Vekllei lifestyle can often feel as aimless and agoraphobic as it does liberating. The four years of service in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/98trlw/allweather_combat_for_the_atomic_age/">Vekllei‚Äôs military</a> reflect Vekllei in total ‚Äî both in its confronting usurpation of traditional institutions <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/blqcwl/utopia_the_participatory_economy_of_vekllei/">by petticoat ideology</a> and in its tantalising, insatiable liberty and pleasure. The military will let you dip a finger into that well, and help prepare your posture for the leap.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/sex-ed.jpg"/> <p>Porno is available over-the-counter at most book stores. Some industry associations attempt to limit availability to minors but generally it&rsquo;s at the discretion of the shopkeeper. Often, shame and embarassment are more powerful tools than legislation in Vekllei.</p>
<p>Generally it&rsquo;s pretty traditional stuff supported by columns and fiction, although it varies between pornographers. It&rsquo;s quite common for well-known Vekllei models to end up in nude shoots either before or after their fame. Nudity is a little more common in Vekllei than it is in the U.S. (at beaches and so on), and that relaxes the moralising of smut somewhat.</p>
<p>That said, the generation previous to Tzipora&rsquo;s (about 20 years prior, so around the early 2050s) were very sex-positive and deviant. Certain cultural iconography from this time is still used in porno &ndash; heavy makeup, curled hair, bare thighs &ndash; but this has prompted a conservatism among Tzipora&rsquo;s generation towards the &ldquo;vanity&rdquo; and &ldquo;superficiality&rdquo; of their parents&rsquo; sexual liberation and bare skin. Today it is much more common to have skirts below the knee than above it, and pornography is starting to shift to accommodate the fetishistic and fantasy as opposed to outright explicit desire common in the previous decades.</p>
<p>foreign porno, however, is highly prized as a sort of racialised sexual unorthodoxy (especially of Asian or Black men and women, neither of whom are particularly large racial demographics in Vekllei). It&rsquo;s rare to find and not commonly traded. There are very few bureaus that import pornography, and export is far more common.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/decay.jpg"/> <p>Talking about utopia in landscape is easy ‚Äî <a href="https://vekllei.city/economy/">Vekllei is a glittering midcentury paradise that fosters human life as a wonderful dream</a>.</p>
<p>Talking about utopia in character is much harder. How can you find utopia in flawed and sometimes unattractive human beings? By what metric is the vague, intuitive values of a utopia measured against a living person?</p>
<p>In <em>Upen</em>, the <a href="https://vekllei.city/religion/">nondenominational animism of Vekllei</a>, there is the living principle of <em>Dumousiantopet</em>: ‚Äúbeautiful and seperate‚Äù. This is a modernist reconciliation of Vekllei‚Äôs <a href="https://vekllei.city/hot-summers-in-the-arctic-and-newda-architecture/">striking, symmetrical and clean <em>Newda</em> architecture school</a> with <em>Upen‚Äôs</em> otherwise modest and naturalistic principles. This makes fine sense for cities and towns, in which the triumphant and monumental nature of Vekllei architecture is at odds with Vekllei‚Äôs efforts to deindustrialise through post-scarcity, but it also applies to human beings, as natural objects, in society. In Vekllei, architecture is not adapted to its environment, but built in spite of it, as recognition of Vekllei‚Äôs human-centric worldview.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, however, Vekllei is a land and people deeply linked with their surrounds, in which purpose and value is drawn from their landscape and nature is an intrinsic part of life. <em>Dumousiantopet</em> does not mean the domination of nature by human construction, but to exist together in segregation of their different systems of beauty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hence the concept of ‚ÄòHuman Decay‚Äô, or <em>Lemdisiandan</em>, a system of human beauty that warps intuitive Western principles (the symmetrical woman, the rational man, the healthy boy, the cute girl, and so on) and worships instead decay, which in Vekllei is a positive natural process that unites all life, including landscape and human beings. Where Vekllei might build a utopian city to last a thousand years, human beauty is acknowledged to be far less eternal; it is in fact fleeting, at once suspended in a single moment and returning slowly to absence, or ‚Äònothingness‚Äô. In Vekllei, it it this process (and how it manifests) in which beauty is found. It is the evidence of life; the symptoms of living; the detail of imperfections in human beings that validate their place on Earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A worn shirt, windswept hair, sweat on your brow ‚Äî small images of dignity and history in how a person talks and carries themselves.</p>
<p>So how does this manifest? Here is Tzipora Lo Ula Desmoines, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/characterforge/comments/btfqm8/show_and_tell_meet_tzipora_desmoines_the_eternal/">a girl who suffers from Gregori-Heitzfeld Syndrome</a>. She is a perfect example of character utopia:</p>
<ul>
<li>She is very shameful about her body and her thinness.</li>
<li>She is angry at a lot of things and cannot let bad memories die.</li>
<li>She suffers from hypertension after her childhood, and is terrified of dogs and loud noises.</li>
<li>Bad dreams interrupt her sleep.</li>
<li>She is distinctive but well-kept, productive but inward-facing.</li>
<li>She is afflicted with nervous tics that manifest as shirt-pulling and nose-rubbing and has had them for many years. They appear involuntarily in nervousness and pointing them out to her will only increase their intensity.</li>
<li>She has obsessions about clothing materials and the material composition of outfits, which can affect her emotionally (she cannot stand a wool skirt and rayon shirt, for example, intersecting). These bizarre principles include the proportion and length of items, and the tightness and looseness of clothes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This list could go on and on to paint a very uncomfortable and invasive picture of an otherwise quiet and happy person, but these examples neglect the many wonderful things about her ‚Äî her affection and good sense of humour, her humility and loyalty, and so on. But while these good things might be employed to counteract the bad to us, to a Vekllei person they would accentuate and complete a complex and positive picture of a girl touched by ‚Äòhuman decay‚Äô, an ugly phrase in English that essentially refers to the sweet detail and intricacies that evidence the life of a person.</p>
<p>Human Decay does not glorify anxiety or mental illness ‚Äî nor does it worship dirtiness for the sake of being dirty, or imperfection for being imperfect ‚Äî but it does recognise the greatness in the texture and detail of human life. So it is that in Vekllei, splotchy birthmarks and soft skin alike are the characteristics of a beautiful person, and lend to a metric of beauty defined by storytelling and complexity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of how Tzipora would be remembered would be in the way she appeared in the person. She was a good-looking young teen-ager of quiet and unusual movements. As she became known to the wider public, her physical appearance would come to define her as both a phenomena and disability ‚Äî a victim of blessings; a sweet child of cotton and gingham carrying on in the dark schism between teen-age impetuosity and the adult world of <em>power</em>. What a tragedy and miracle she was.Zelda, which was how she introduced herself among friends, was as intricate as she was indecipherable. She had her own internal logics; a unique carousel of intuition that marked her out as some unfortunate <em>undamoispotet</em> among other teen-agers. In conversation that stirred any emotion in her she was susceptible to spasmodic, defensive movements that distracted from her talking. Most frequently she would pull on her nose as if to wipe it, or reach for her shirt at the shoulder and adjust it. If she was particularly self-conscious, which could be brought on even by the spasms themselves, she would take hold of her shirt and keep her hand there, as though her thin girlish arms could shield her breast from judgement. She confided in her father that she did not like the tics. The more conscious of her imperfections she was, the more her idiosyncrasies flared. He asked her once how long she‚Äôd had them ‚Äî the nose rubbings, the shirt pullings ‚Äî and she said she couldn‚Äôt remember, but thought it might have been after she arrived in America. Which was possible, he supposed ‚Äî trauma could bring on tics, even laymen knew that. If you spend a while with her, however, it becomes more obvious that her tics are symptomatic of a nervous, fidgety subconscious not cowed by the supposed tomboyishness of her movements ‚Äî she jigs a leg, and run the back of her hand beneath her nose. Then, when she realises people notice those things and judge her for them, the same synchronistic hyperactivities became shirt-pulling and face-touching.</p>

<p>The <em>Caf√© Resmoiones</em> approaches its hundredth birthday as the girls outside await their fifteenth. The building was once a kindergarten, so they‚Äôd been told, but through decades of Vekllei‚Äôs irreverent planning it had become a caf√©. It was not a very good caf√©, the food was shit, but the building was nice and it was at the bottom of Lola‚Äôs steep residential hill. Locals struggling down it would pool at the bottom and inevitably step inside for a drink. In summer, the caf√© serves seasonal iced drinks to welcome a climate that has destroyed much of the world‚Äôs equatorial agriculture but has provided their arctic home a liveable summer. The girls dodge freckles and sip iced coffee as millions around the world flee encroaching deserts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The unstable Atlantic pressure oscillation, of which Vekllei anchors as the Vekllei low pole, can pull in bitter cold from the Greenland currents, or warmth from the Azores tempestuously.</p>
<p>So it is that in summer, on a beach of black igneous sand from the volcanoes of this place, hot rains can descend instantly and beat pedestrians until the rains vanish, minutes later. Winters are equally unstable ‚Äî they shift between unlivable cold and sporadic thawing periods.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have ever spoken to a Vekllei person in English, you will notice an irritating habit of adding unnecessary vowels to words. ‚ÄòLoafer‚Äô becomes ‚Äúlowiefer‚Äù, ‚Äòa ciggie‚Äô becomes ‚Äúdes cigoirettenne‚Äù, and the concept of ‚Äòtrees‚Äô become ‚Äútres foliage‚Äù. This is an instinctual artefact of <a href="https://vekllei.city/language/">Vekllei talk, which incorporates vocal gestures to accompany physical ones</a>, even in foreign words. It is also how ‚Äònakedity‚Äù‚Äôbecomes ‚ÄòNewda‚Äô, the dominant architectural school in Vekllei, found almost everywhere.</p>
<p>As a sort of post-deco modernism, it retains the striking geometry and vertical movement of more decadent architectural styles, but employs them conservatively to better reveal naked shape ‚Äî ‚Äònewda‚Äô. It is a flexible school that manifests differently depending on the utility of the building. Residential apartments, for example, often display elements reminiscent of constructivism, where national bureaus, or ‚Äòhard buildings‚Äô as they‚Äôre called in Vekllei, are more brutalistic. The stripped classicism of buildings of authority stands in stark contrast to the playful googie of utilities like phone booths and public restrooms. These allusions to grand midcentury architecture are domesticated with a unique form of Vekllei populuxe, usually because of Vekllei‚Äôs <a href="https://vekllei.city/language/">use of colour and shape as a language in itself</a>.</p>
<p>Some have called it a &lsquo;Paris moderne&rsquo; for the hegemony of the modernist bastards in Vekllei&rsquo;s architecture schools, but to Vekllei people, these space-age  visions of the future are home.</p>

<h2 id="genetic-freak">

</h2>
<p>Gregori babies, as they&rsquo;re called, suffer from Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome. It&rsquo;s usually described as agelessness at menarche, since about 90% of cases are girls. It&rsquo;s essentially a genetic malfunction that puts the body in a cycle of eternal growth &ndash; they effectively continue to grow (without actually growing bigger), but do not develop and are more or less suspended at the onset of their first period.</p>
<p>The question of whether they&rsquo;re &lsquo;mentally&rsquo; children is an interesting one that there&rsquo;s not a simple answer to. Their minds are not fully developed the way an adult human&rsquo;s would be, since ageing stops in early teen-age years and before pubescence. They tend to retain some childish characteristics &ndash; mostly decision-making and emotional control. But this sort of speculation risks dehumanising otherwise very functional and capable people. The effects of long-term childhood and social isolation are far more profound on the personality of a Gregori child than any biological limitation or squabbling about the teen-age/adult schism.</p>
<p>Boys can also have it, but are always hyperallergic and suffer from a broad anaphylaxis at onset of the condition (usually a little earlier, in early thelarche at 8-10y/o). It will almost always kill them. The discrepancy between the sexes is still being researched.</p>
<p>Girls also have a risk of developing hyperallergies. Gregori babies have never developed cancers as far as anyone is aware, and these hyperallergies are a result of this hyperactive immune system.</p>
<p>Gregori babies fulfill the first of two miracles required for sainthood in the Catholic Church. In other parts of the world they are targets of violence as practicers of witchcraft or demonic pacts. The oldest Gregori baby, Tzipora Desmoines, is 120 years old and is set to overtake the human lifespan. She was 13th overall to have been diagnosed, but Gregori children have high mortality rates (largely violence, car accidents and suicides) and she is the first to pass 60 years of age. So, somewhat ironically, the children with speculated immortality almost always die young.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/square.jpg"/> <p>Nestled between the regional tram offices and the pre-war Ferouistet Department Store, the Lola district is not known for much but her department store and good schools. It sits on the slope of the wide Vekllei capital basin, where the Atlantic can be seen from the street. It was Tzipora&rsquo;s first home in Vekllei, and it was where she lived with her father. The schools were good, the kids were all right, and the trams were a gift from Christ.</p>
<p>Most of Vekllei looks like Lola, marked by her mid-rise streets and public thermal ponds and geyser baths (named after the Vekllei village of Geyser, as it happens). Vekllei people do not generally own cars, and mostly commute via the metro, the exhaustive tram network or on occasion in a loan car from the autopool. The streets are narrow and empty of traffic save for service vehicles, and in the summers they are invaded by neighbourhood children playing baseball or seeking shade under the street trees.</p>
<p>Lola is one of hundreds of neighbourhoods in the vast, densely-populated capital of the country from which it aquires its namesake. It is a city facing its past, now that there is plenty to eat and little to do &ndash; and as a sprawling urban utopia with a fierce nostalgia for preindustrial life, there is no other place like it on Earth. Caught at once between the future of space and helijets, and her collective memories of agriculture and simple labour, Vekllei&rsquo;s petticoat society marks a departure from futurism and a turn to its history, as though the violence and suffering and chaos of the past three centuries were but a chore obstructing utopia.</p>
<h2 id="participatory-economics--property">
  Participatory Economics &amp; Property
  <a class="anchor" href="#participatory-economics--property">#</a>
</h2>
<p>In Vekllei‚Äôs feminised parpolity, the revitalisation of <a href="https://vekllei.city/religion/">Upen</a> brought about an ancient understanding of property reborn in the widespread poverty of Vekllei society following <a href="https://vekllei.city/the-forgotten-generation/">the first Atomic War</a>. Widespead social regression and cross-generational nostalgia for preindustrial life took hold in urban Vekllei society almost immediately after the atomic fire, as the ruins of colonial and imperial society lay around the Vekllei people. The monarchy, a tokenistic and fashionable invention of the gilded Mercantile age just three centuries before, evaporated nearly overnight with the death of the king. So, too, did the military junta salivating over the charred remains of the capital find it nearly impossible to consolidate power in a city now without infrastructure. In the ashes of modern industrialisation grew tempered, atomised communities of streets and villages ‚Äî the common council as we see it today. Food production returned to the city in the ruins of vast factories, wide canals were dug for unmotorised barges, and councils of working people organised self-interest in these communities, which would be understood a century later as <em>Sundress Municipalism</em>. So too did the common understanding of property evaporate.</p>
<p>The old libertarian bugbear of the origins of property was revived ‚Äî the population had been decimated, Vekllei people were surrounded by vast swaths of useless land of deceased ownership, and the institutions of old society had failed to retake power following the war. The question of ownership was pertinent, as it would clarify the sovereigns of future society. The sovereignty of Vekllei, as it would later be determined, is decentralised and portioned between any land-operating individual, local organisations, municiple councils, and syndicates. This tradition carries on today. In any one apartment building or row-house, you will find the inhabitants, building administrators, local councils and tenant unions exercising types of ownership over a space. In other words; residents of a home will have implied ownership over a home, but a community has implied ownership over the community itself. The intersection of different kinds of ownership result in complex and partially uncoded laws that, although vulnerable to beaurocratic and exhaustive legal disputes, are mostly discarded in place of local opinion.</p>
<p>The foundation of the Vekllei political and economic system is the community; a population larger than a single family and small enough to have valuable social bonds; a group of people bound by common living, work, and recreation. An unruly or criminal tenant is more likely to be run out of town by his neighbours than by the courts. This is not to misrepresent the daily conflicts of Vekllei domestic society ‚Äî disputes are common and meaningless. But abuse of common ownership is tempered by the fact that it is quite impossible to evict any individual from his home without overwhelming agreement of his neighbours, essentially relegating formal council ownership to irrelevency; the true owners of any single home are, in practice, the community in which it is situated, supervised by protections offered under the local judicial councils.</p>
<p>The ownership of a factory is a lot more straightforward ‚Äî the old mantra of the democratic workplace is more or less true here. Principally, unautomated (manned) factories recieve production requests from one of the hundreds of different economic bureaus keeping stock of production in the country, which otherwise do not directly supervise production except in circumstance of scarcity. Production requests are voluntary, and usually formalities in the production of items for local consumption. Heavily centralised industries, particularly heavy industries like raw product extraction and refining, usually operate under direct supervision of a bureau. Unions exist independently of the bureau system and usually hold membership from every worker of a factory, including managers. Mirroring nested councils, there are also larger industry unions that generally involve themselves only in general strikes and legal cases without precedent.</p>
<p>The ownership of a grocery store is clear and implied, if not codified. The person who manages and works the shop, either through implied property bonding (so-called ‚Äòfolk morality‚Äô; a phenomena largely dependent on the person‚Äôs social value and local consent) or familial tradition, owns the shop. These are not lawful protections of ownership ‚Äî indeed, Vekllei common law says very little about senrouive business ownership ‚Äî but in almost every case, they are validated by a community intuitively. Even antisocial or hostile shop-owners are rarely challenged on their right to the property they manage ‚Äî the shop is, technically speaking, seen as an extension of the natural landscape (as no more than fired clay and timber), and the live-and-let-live culture in Vekllei is sympathetic to leaving people to their business and shop elsewhere. Legal disputes on the right to live above and manage a store are relatively rare, and usually resolved through ‚Äòblood rights‚Äô ( similar to ‚Äòfolk morality‚Äô) in the case of an individual or in a more democratic fashion involving multiple relevant complainants, like employees. In both of these examples, the disputed property is considered an entity itself with its own rights and interests extrapolated from its history and surrounding landscape.</p>
<p>Herein remains the distinction between <em>venrouiva</em>/<em>senrouive</em> property, and their implied ownership. <em>Venrouiva</em> usually operate in cooperation with the product bureaus in the case of manufacturing, or other national organisations as their industry requires in education, medicine, power, water, etc. They are ultimately beholden to the direction of the country, as organised by the seats of power and politics. <em>Senrouive</em> exists somewhat independent of the economy entirely, recieving mostly what it asks for and immersing their respective economies in the communities around them. Although all physical material in Vekllei is ultimately property of the country (a vague, naturalistic construct seen as distinct from the government, at least in a Western understanding), <em>senrouive</em>will almost never be managed directly by larger unions or administrative bodies. This distinction does little to articulate public and private ownership, as the very concept of property remains formally unacknowledged in the economy in the country. Instead, all business today is conducted in cooperation with the ideas of community, implied ownership, self-interest and some sort of idea of supply and demand largely usurped by post-scarcity and widespread automation.</p>
<p>Because of this, Vekllei does not actually consider itself classless ‚Äî Indeed, <em>venrouiva</em> are fundamentally a coordinating class of workers that are atomised from <em>senrouive</em> work through their power and decision-making. They are a class of power in law, education, science, medicine, and politics, and consequently, guide the direction of the country. Although even <em>senrouive</em> business is still fundamentally worker-owned and managed (as part of Sundress Municipalism), this hierarchy remains in principle, even if the quality of life of <em>venrouiva</em> and <em>senrouive</em> workers is in practice identical. This fact is rarely acknowledged outside of technical circles in the country, because it matters very little to the common Vekllei person. Vekllei is not outwardly egalitarian, despite practice, and the problems of power are mitigated by a mess of democratic structures ultimately enslaved to self-interested, independent communities of people. For one of the most centralised countries in the world, with a homogenous ethnic people and culture, Vekllei is better described as hundreds of thousands of hamlets than a single city.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/parade.jpg"/> <p>In <a href="https://vekllei.city/introducing-landscape/">Vekllei</a> on the first of each May, the women‚Äôs councils and industrial unions wipe clean their banners and flags and join great parades that regale the main streets of the city with song and colour. They carry flags and banners in celebration of womanhood and remembrance of the dead ‚Äî for those Potter‚Äôs Fields and unmarked graves that intern nameless women across the world.</p>
<p>They walk in universal solidarity but not without local identity ‚Äî women‚Äôs unions, called chapels, number themselves. Here Local Chapel ‚Ññ 23, represented mostly by a half-dozen families and a few generations, make their way to the <a href="https://i1.wp.com/vekllei.city/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_0555.png?ssl=1">Little Vekllei prefecture</a>, where the day‚Äôs march will take them back to the heart of the city. Little Lili leads the charge with confetti, while her sisters, mother and grandmother follow. They will find it difficult to fit the flags on the streetcar. Her bespectacled sister Patet is sickly and this is the first time she&rsquo;s left the house in five days.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://vekllei.city/the-forgotten-generation/">catastrophe of the first atomic war</a> had set in motion what no protest or revolution ever had ‚Äî a cleansing of the political and cultural landscape, and a rebirth of Vekllei traditional culture and reestablishment of <a href="https://vekllei.city/religion/">Upen</a> in everyday life.</p>
<p>It is a day where the men shower the precious women of their lives with gifts and affection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although Vekllei is not necessarily a progressive country, and is often a land of absurd contradiction in Western political tradition, Vekllei women enjoy a society built for them. And really built for them too, on an infrastructural level. Womanhood in the country is not defined by commodity or appearance, but by superficially humanist ideas the culture associates with womanhood &ndash; compassion, bravery, intelligence, grace, etc. They are defined not by their relationships or their economic circumstance, but by their friends, political opinions, ability, etc. The decommodification of society has also decommodified womanhood. Vekllei is not simply a good place to be a woman, but is in fact a female country.</p>

It was important to her, as an ageless girl of ultimately transient relationships, to be able to establish for herself a family wherever she lived. So within a few years of her arrival in Vekllei, she put time in as a warden for her apartment block and undertook the medical training that went with it.</p>
<p>She carried debts of blood because of how she sold out her friends some years before. She was very conscious of the fact that she was living as a traitor to her old friends. If she was going to die in a nuclear blast ‚Äî so be it. It would finally be repaid. She had lived a wonderful life these last couple years and had made good use of her borrowed time.</p>
<p>When the war did come, as she always had suspected it would, she was prepared to die in it. She was caught outside when the bomb hit Montre, and when it failed to kill her, she spent three days searching tirelessly for wounded with the rest of the Civil Defense corps. It was only when her legs gave out that she made the long journey back to her father in the capital, to reassure him that she was in fact still alive.</p>
<p>She was awarded for her efforts, along with two others from Montre-Lola. It cemented her place as grandmother of the small agricultural village; the quite librarian from the city who had only the village‚Äôs interests at heart.</p>

<p>Because the other girls would not stop calling her a lesbian, and because they had realised she was scared of loud noises and made use of that fact, Tzipora struck this bitch and her friend out beyond the football pitches after school. Tzipora was a good fighter ‚Äî on her side is viciousness and a conviction to fight. That‚Äôs usually enough for most teen-agers, who like the idea of fighting but are unprepared for the unglamorous reality of it. But those things do not make up for being short and underweight, and the two older girls had her bleeding on the ground by the time two passing community police-officers pulled them apart.</p>
<p>As an officer examined Tzipora‚Äôs head with a torch to find the bleeding in her scalp, one of the girls was desperately explaining that Tzipora had swung first and out of nowhere. Tzipora had nothing for her defence, since it was true and since she did not speak to cops, but the policewomen figured it out for themselves easily enough. Tzipora had been beaten savagely in her foolhardy attempt to get back at her bullies, and her pitiful state made the girl‚Äôs desperate blame-passing petty and childish. Although she might have lost the fight, she was not bothered again by the two older girls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Part of the difficulty in understanding Vekllei as a foreigner is in the basic assumptions we make through the lens of modernity. Vekllei has not discovered ‚Äòlandscape‚Äô, and it has not discovered ‚Äòthe Child‚Äô.</p>
<p>Now, children have existed since ever, but we live in an age of modernity and commodity ‚Äî of nuclear power and department stores. The concept of the ‚Äòchild‚Äô as we currently identify and understand it did not exist prior to a certain time, in which the rapid accessibility of both industrial goods and luxury in society stripped children of their productive relationships with family and labour, and introduced them to the beast that would become modern schooling. As Kojin Karatani writes about the Meiji Restoration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚Ä¶ It becomes clear that the grouping of children by age in the compulsory educational system of modern Japan signified the uprooting of children, as abstract and homogenous entities, from productive relations, social classes, and communities that had previously been their concrete contexts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, Vekllei is not Japan. Vekllei is caught, instead, between a spectre of modernity and the myth of its past. At once socialistic and deeply conservative, the intuition of the common Vekllei person is going to be fundamentally different to a person acclimatised to foreign society.</p>
<p>Vekllei has a modern compulsory education system like much else of the world, but the way in which Petticoat society is coloured by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/9snaar/the_stewards_of_the_earth/">Upen</a> forces a strange compromise between modernity and Vekllei‚Äôs agrarian past. Tzipora, for example, shares a classroom with students both older and younger than herself. Boys and girls wear a single uniform, shared with teachers, all the way from kindergarten to university. Compulsory school operates only three or four days a week and lasts only for a few hours. Work and play, in addition to education, have always been essential parts of childhood in the country and modern schooling has accommodated that. By the time a child is a teen-ager, the person has essentially transitioned into young-adulthood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By sexual maturation, a Vekllei person has essentially transitioned to young-adulthood and submerged themselves in the productive relations of the adult age; they often leave school for work, they quickly drift to mature, independent relationships with parents, and generally marry young.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The consequence of this idea is that Vekllei people often attend some sort of school for most of their lives. Whether trade schools for work or adult learning institutions for personal curiosity, it is very common to fill the many free hours of a Vekllei person&rsquo;s week with education of some kind.</p>
<p>This is not to mislead the reader into imagining adults and children mixing freely, either in compulsory schooling or wider society. Adults do not attend compulsory schools and the median age of a classroom rarely deviates more than a few years either side. But from the perspective of the child, growing up in Vekllei desegregates children from one-another and introduces them to mature economic and social relationships early on, allowing in theory real liberty to choose and work for your lifestyle in the country.</p>
<p>-&ndash;</p>
<p>This scene takes place in a <a href="https://vekllei.city/parks/">Kadesoinan</a> park, as indicated by the offerings bench and concrete paths snaking through water. In the distance is the Lola Neighbourhood School, with its central classroom tower standing six stories high. In the city beyond is Atomic Park and its distinctive, massive sculpture.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/christmas2018.jpg"/> <p>She had always been a very serious girl, from the first time he‚Äôd met her. It was more than a reflection of character; it was how she talked, how she carried herself. Her clothes were plain, her nervous tics were not that funny, and she was afflicted with all sorts of fears and anxieties. She opens her mouth in public and what comes out is usually of serious opinion ‚Äî a judgement of something or a political remark. But that is not how Gregori syndrome works. It does not take young girls and make them old. As the months wore on and the length of the days reflected the passing of warm season, he learned well enough that she was a teen-ager, despite her seriousness. She was slowly domesticated into regular society, her conversation became casual, and she started to worry more about things that might have been inconceivably petty in the months before.</p>
<p>In late November they put up the tree, at her insistence. She was six months a citizen at this point, and not yet familiar with all the familial traditions of the country. But she knew Christmas. And that became her season. This chick, awash with anxiety and domestic terror, was fucking around with ornaments he‚Äôd left in the box for five years.</p>
<p>‚ÄòDo you mind if I put the angel up the top?‚Äô She asked him. She was kneeling at the foot of the tree with a sample of tree-toppers spread out before her. He looked up from his paper.</p>
<p>‚ÄòWhy would I mind?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄòI just thought you might.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄòDo what you like, I don‚Äôt mind.‚Äô</p>
<p>She shook her head and shifted back on her rump.</p>
<p>‚ÄòIt‚Äôs no fun if you‚Äôre not helping. I have no idea what to do, I haven‚Äôt had a proper tree since I was eight.‚Äô</p>
<p>He put the paper to the side and rubbed his eyes under his spectacles. He breathed out slowly.</p>
<p>‚ÄòWhat if I make Christmas lunch and you can do the tree?‚Äô He said.</p>
<p>‚ÄòNo, I‚Äôm already doing lunch,‚Äô she said, then in English: ‚ÄòPitch in, that‚Äôs how we all do it here.‚Äô</p>
<p>She got up and shuffled her feet into slippers and sat next to him.</p>
<p>‚ÄòDid you invite Ayn?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄòI haven‚Äôt, yet,‚Äô he said, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs been a busy week. I‚Äôll ask her, though. She‚Äôd be thrilled to be asked.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄòMaybe I should make a card.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄòThat would be nice,‚Äô he nodded. ‚ÄòShe likes you a lot.‚Äô</p>
<p>She looked surprised and smiled at him, teeth and everything.</p>
<p>‚ÄòThat‚Äôs sweet,‚Äô she said, and tugged at her shirt. ‚ÄòShe‚Äôs sweet. I like her too.‚Äô</p>
<p>As Tzipora worked her way into a Christmas fever, he began to like it too. She was better when she was happier ‚Äî she smiled more, and the compulsion to pull her shirt or rub her nose abated. It was very strange to see a girl he‚Äôd known as old before her time suddenly revert five years and adopt a flurry of youth; it was a childish rekindling of the good things in her that might be more accessible if she‚Äôd grown up in her home country. He was suckered into the season‚Äôs festivities too, a holiday empty in the country of plenty without faith and family. He even attended a mass at Tzipora‚Äôs request ‚Äî she was still deicidal, but she remained a Catholic and wanted to be a part of the fun.</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve Tzipora had put herself to sleep with sickly Winter wine and had curled up on the couch. Ayn sat with Baron at the table and they finished what was left of the bottle as the evening rolled on. He‚Äôd lost the nose but still had antlers. She was in a Santa hat and sweet with good cheer.</p>
<p>‚ÄòIt‚Äôs funny, when you think about it,‚Äô she said. Her smile had become small and serious. ‚ÄòIt all turned out well enough, didn‚Äôt it?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄòIt‚Äôs hardly started,‚Äô he smirked, and gestured with his thumb at the girl on the couch. His voice was very low as to not wake the girl. ‚ÄòShe‚Äôs got a whole thing planned. She doesn‚Äôt want me to know what it is. She‚Äôll happily let me clean up her wrapping paper and wash the dishes, but she won‚Äôt tell me what‚Äôs going on. She‚Äôs got something in the oven, that‚Äôs all I know.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄòMmhmm,‚Äô she said, and she stretched out a hand and gently laid it across his. ‚ÄòBut I mean in the scheme of things, Baron. I meant in general.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄòLike how?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄòWell, you and I could never marry. And I could never have a baby, you know that. I always wanted a child,‚Äô she said. She squeezed his hand. ‚ÄòBut here we are, anyway. Think about what it was like when you left for America, and then as it is now.‚Äô</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>‚ÄòI think about it,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre lucky.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄòOf course we are.‚Äô</p>
<p>He thought about it some more when he got up to carry her to bed some hours into the early morning.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/deadvalley.jpg"/> <p>As Zelda got older and her sense of urgency decayed, the bone between life and death seemed to grow less important as time went on. Could you blame her? She was eighty years old at this point and still as fresh as fourteen ‚Äî suspended somewhere in the misery of her old age and enthusiasm of her youth. You get a sense of it when you meet her ‚Äî there‚Äôs no urgency about her, no hurry at all. No hurry at all. Just the mild, sweet curiosity of her teen-age appearance and the patience of an old woman.</p>
<p>Since the friends and family of her teen-age years (her real teen-age years) were dead by this time, their spirits had returned to their places of birth. Her mother was in Ula. Baron was in Lola, by the sea. She hoped everyone she loved was at peace. She did not have many friends in her first cycle of life but the ones she did have were precious to her.</p>
<p>In the mountains south of Montre, near the village where she had worked as a librarian for some years, there lies a healthy plateau between monumental basalt ribs. Here is the grave of her mother, long since turned to ashes and returned to the earth. This whole <em>ro</em>, this flower-tundra, was alive with spirits. The <em>ro</em> are important to Vekllei people as the meeting points between life and death. Her mother appears as a cat she recognised from the train station, and the two of them share a space for a while. Zelda never knew her mother all that well, and disliked her for some of the things she did, but eighty years does a lot to the turbulence of grudges and these days she wonders more and more about the bloodline from whence she came and, perhaps some day, she might return.</p>
<p>She pets the cat and talks to her mother, and once it gets too cold to bear, she wishes her mother well and leaves her. Zelda knew there were demons here and didn‚Äôt want to spend much time in the <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/ou/#valley-of-the-dead">Valley of the Dead</a> after dark.</p>
<p>She returned home on the express line from <a href="/factbook/landscape/boroughs/ou/">Tiamoin</a> and alighted at Montre-Dupau, where her little country home and the working week awaited her.</p>

<p>The two girls caught a train from school to the terminus, and then a rural line as far as it would take them out of the city. They had walked the granite shoulder of a mountain range for most of the afternoon, carrying only a few mouthfuls of provisions between them. They were both dressed in winter uniforms for the summer hike. The sea air gathered cold and malevolence as it escaped up the range of peaks that chased Vekllei Proper. The girls walked as far as they could with a view of the city abreast before mounting the peak and descending into the flowery plateau beyond the city centre. The path gave way to basalt drumlins and soft flower-tundra. The horizon was marked by volcanic imperfections, and framed a stretch of colour entirely untouched. For only a few hour‚Äôs ride from the city, and a handful of foodstuffs acquired from the small village the train terminated in, they had disembarked from civilisation entirely and entered the world of the spirits.</p>
<p>The flower-tundra is like mania; it overwhelms the soul in great colour and ancient presence. Centuries collapse, bloodlines congeal, and suddenly there is a hair between you and your forefathers.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/kokaparks.jpg"/> <p><strong>Between the atomic fire that ruined the city</strong>, and the death of the king, there was a time when the city of Vekllei once resembled its lifeless lava fields to the North. In the communities that gathered themselves in the shadow of holocaust, common agriculture like fruits and berries returned to the city in what they call¬†<em>koka</em> parkland.</p>
<p><em>Koka</em> is the Vekllei word for forest (<em>ka</em>), combined with a prefixtual particle that ‚Äòindustrialises‚Äô it. It is usually translated as ‚Äòmunicipal forest‚Äô, and was designed for and continues to serve two purposes in the city today.</p>
<p>The first is that consumable raw agricultural products, like fruits, nuts and berries, were valuable commodity in the starving post-war neighbourhoods that emerged in the ruins of the old city. These foods were combined with bread and meat, staples of the Vekllei diet, to give flavour in a country without easy access to spices and salt. By integrating them into common gardens, the people of Vekllei returned the production of food into a common, shared space that predicated the wider decommodification of the country. To this day, very little fruit is distributed through grocers; it is grown freely and year-round in¬†<em>koka</em> parks in the city.</p>
<p>The second is that¬†<em>Upen,</em> the animistic spiritualism that guides most of Vekllei culture, blossomed in the ashes of the monarchy and revived a real desire to desegregate spirits from urban life. The construction of massive¬†<em>koka</em> parks, filled with food and old trees and free-flowing water, offered an apology to the spirits driven out by industry and agriculture, and invited them to return to human settlement as fellow custodians of the earth. Many¬†<em>koka</em> parks house temples for dialogue with spirits and sprites, and they bless the surrounding neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>To step into a <em>koka</em>¬†park is to disappear from the urban world. Birds warble, leaves whisper to themselves and water trickles sweetly through bright mosses. The largest parks hide the surrounding skyline entirely, and disappear tourists for hours at a time, only to spit them out hours later, confused and exhausted. Any piece of infrastructure, any human touch, is strangled with banners and wires suspending pennants. In keeping with Vekllei Semaphore, a separate language from¬†<em>upotenne</em>¬†and written Vekllei, the flags themselves speak to visitors through their colour, direction and shape. The effect of being swallowed by a¬†<em>koka</em> park is detoxifying and luxurious ‚Äî and by the time your lunch break has ended, you are fed and at peace.</p>
<p>-&ndash;</p>
<p><em>If you have any questions, let me know!</em> You can read more about Koka parks and learn all about Vekllei at <a href="https://www.millmint.net">www.vekllei.city</a>, which has just been redesigned and I think it looks pretty amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Post Scriptum</strong>: The figure in this girl, Tzipora Desmoines, is in her second week in Vekllei in this picture. Timid and isolated through her sudden immigration, she makes her way through a koka park with a guide she can&rsquo;t read, fretting about which tram she has to get back home.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/guilt.jpg"/> <p>Some years ago, she was in the desert. At the time she had just fallen out with her lover, and their friends had sided with him. The reasons why they had sided with him seemed to matter less and less as time wore on ‚Äî  they might have always liked him better.</p>
<p>They were self-styled anarchists waging war against the Indian Springs Sheriff‚Äôs Department, who operated one of the larger camps north of Las Vegas. Fashioning themselves as martyrs, they carried on in the spirit of Sacco and Vanzetti.</p>
<p>Tzipora had been growing tired of fighting. There had been an outbreak of botulism not far from where they were camped out, and she was worried she might catch it. She wouldn&rsquo;t survive it if she did, because her body was wasting as she slowly starved. The folks they used to steal from had fled the fighting.
Once her lover had left her, and her presence began to irritate the small group, she left one night and walked to the local Women‚Äôs Auxiliary, a barracks of women and girls supporting the marxist stooges in that part of Nevada. It was impressive to the fourteen year-old  ‚Äî  the dusty desert outpost was flush with Soviet-made rifles and medicine, with rations aplenty. As she enlisted, she thought of her abandoned comrades. She was filled with anger and jealousy.</p>
<p>She told her garrison leader, a man with an accent from somewhere on the East Coast she couldn‚Äôt quite place, about how she and her skilled anarchist friends had been at waging guerilla war against the secessionists. Then, in an act of spite, she mentioned that her old comrades had stolen supplies from an Worker&rsquo;s Reunification Party camp. Perhaps, in her silly little head, she had wanted to see them brought under control and disciplined, and she would finally be satisfied after their cruel words and coldness.</p>
<p>Michael and Lenny, two friends, leaders, and one an ex-lover, were picked up by a WRP patrol and shot in the head in their prison cells. The KGB, which was supporting the WRP at that time, gathered up the rest of the anarchists, six in all, and sent them to a detention camp in Utah. Tzipora would not see any of them again.</p>
<p>The same day she found this out, she was singled out at morning assembly and awarded for her efforts in front of the entire Women‚Äôs Auxiliary. When she returned to her bunk, she found a hundred pairs of eyes on her, and her meager possessions thrown onto the floor. She slept outside as a traitor that night, and would leave soon after.</p>
<p>Blood does not wash off her hands. The shock of her childish mistake gave way to extraordinary self-hate, and some sixty years later she is still coloured by queasy, anxious guilt.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/scout.jpg"/> <p><strong>About half of Vekllei kids</strong> go through the &lsquo;Blossom&rsquo; network of youth orgs at some point in their lives. Yeah, youth groups are popular nowadays. The Boy Scouts and Girl Guides of the United States are as mandatory as schooling in some states, and various Red Pioneers around the world test orthodoxy in Soviet and Red Chinese children.</p>
<p>The Girl Guides of the U.S. now boast catalogues of several hundred pages, selling thousands of Guides-branded items to their own members and Guide-friendly suburbs. Outwardly, the cartoons of Heinz and Carpenter (both of <em>Western Family</em> <em>Magazine</em> fame) might show off Guides assembling tents in jigger jackets and bright sashes, but they always seemed to neglect the impoverished girls priced out of the Guides organisation, like was so common at the time. There were a lot of poor girls in America by 2083.</p>
<p>Things are not much better for the Boy Scouts, who are only a few lethal armaments away from becoming paramilitary. They worship the flag and guard America‚Äôs character. Following the catastrophic Sino-American nuclear exchange, the Boy Scouts were enlisted in Civil Defense, an order that would kill many times more boys than the bombs ever did. You had kids being killed protecting grocers in food riots, and disappearing en masse as the cities collapsed. It was absurd.</p>
<p>So in the search for an analogue to Vekllei‚Äôs Blossoms, do we have any choice but to look to the Pioneers of those miserable countries of the East? After all, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/9dikf6/shot_like_a_dog_in_a_supermarket_the_vekllei/e5hwuay/?context=3">Vekllei has no money to spend</a>, and no flag to worship (the domestic standard is a simple red rectangle, the international standard is decorated). Perhaps the Blossoms, a relatively decentralised organisation for a youth group, has no real comparison in the world today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Boys and girls of schooling age can join unisex troops</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(the literal translation of the word is ‚Äòbarracks‚Äô, but in Vekllei it lacks the military connotation)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and they will receive a uniform of wool, lisle cotton and nylon blended advanced fabrics. On their person they carry binoculars, twine, and tools of various utility. On hikes they often carry air rifles for small game hunts; most every Blossom will learn the basics of gun safety and shooting at some point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The real emphasis of the Blossom network <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/9snaar/the_stewards_of_the_earth/">is in the naturalist spiritualism of the country, or Upen</a>. Blossoms are taught about agriculture, food production and consumption in their society. Most troops enforce ‚Äòcatch-kill‚Äô rules: if a troop member wants to eat meat, they should kill, skin, and clean the animal to illustrate the relationship between consumption and exploitation. Environmentalism in the organisation is broad and humancentric. Although environmental science and the geology of the country is taught, most camps place emphasis on rural infrastructure, <em>roupoismentet</em> (or &rsquo;local living&rsquo;, a word for agrarian communities), and the place of spirits in Vekllei‚Äôs domestic affairs. This is not to portray Vekllei as an overly vegetarian or sentimental country &ndash; just that Upen is a part of life for Vekllei children, and contributes to their understanding of the world.</p>
<p>Many Blossoms pursue employment in the Armed Forces upon leaving school, as a natural extension of the organised lifestyle of a youth org. This is not to say that life in the Blossoms is particularly militaristic &ndash; Vekllei does not actually have professional culture, despite hierarchies, and so life in the Blossoms is casual fair, and like the rest of the country, largely individualistic and self-satisfying. Boys and girls go on camps, eat food out of a can, sleep under the stars, collect badges, fall in and out of puppy love, learn to assemble a rifle, meet wild animals, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tzipora perches on a tree stump as her friend rushes to steady the camera. She surveys her domain. The flower-tundra from here to Montre was uninhabited. Society had been stripped away and they were fellow creatures of the forest. Her friend places the plaque with her name and year on it at the foot of the stump, and Tzipora adopts a masculine pose typical of her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôm still fleshing out the ideas in this post, so let me know if you have any questions. Like always, you can sort my profile by posts for more info. You can read more about the project at <a href="http://www.vekllei.city/">www.vekllei.city</a>, although that website is still a work in progress. It‚Äôll do for now.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/spiritstewards.jpg"/> <p><em>Upen</em> is the animistic religion of Vekllei. It doesn&rsquo;t have priests, but it has ceremony, and it shapes every part of the country today. From apartment cooperatives to the types of cotton used in clothing, <em>Upen</em> has extraordinary reach for an ostensibly agnostic and secular country.</p>
<p>It works out that way because Upen is not an organised religion, and resembles more closely a collective spiritualism with supernatural beliefs. It is not incompatible with theism, a quirk we&rsquo;ll explore below, but it manifests outside of churches in the passing of seasons, code of dress and rural egalitarianism.</p>
<p>How exactly a person goes about their animism is their business, and depends on personal faith. Most Vekllei people are atheistic and believe there is another plane of existence which houses their ancestors, spirits, sprites, and demons. This is reflected in how they see the world:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄãUpen, as atheistic and animistic, shelters the landscape from becoming ‚Äòsimply nature‚Äô, as it does when viewed as a product of a monotheistic creator god. To these people, agnostic of &rsquo;landscape&rsquo;, nature is not ‚Äòsimply nature‚Äô; it is a spiritual vessel in itself, inalienable and inextricably linked to human purpose and satisfaction. Industry is divorced from the whole concept; it is a country of forest commons, collective stewardship, and volcanic unrest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not always easy to reconcile the basic assumptions Upen makes about the world. Viewed through Tzipora‚Äôs nonpracticing Roman Catholic lens, the mess of her religious beliefs look something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>There is a single creator God</strong>, who took on man‚Äôs flesh as Christ. He</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(and in her mind, it is most certainly a He)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is not omnibenevolent or even totally omniscient. Humans, as weak and mortal, must obey Him until they have the power to usurp Him. He is a guiding force of the world. Spirits, as physical manifestations of the landscape, are fellow travelers on this planet and should always be treated with respect, as humans are guests. With a fragile, physical form, it is a uniquely human burden to cultivate and protect the land, and actualise their purpose as a species.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, to dissect her version of Upen, we have here four (five) different characters in the spiritual world:</p>
<p>First are <em>spirits</em> and <em>sprites</em>, which are the souls and fabric of the forests and hills. They are as old as the Earth itself and predate humans by billions of years, a fact that seems implied when you are joined in physical presence with them. They treasure, and indeed, embody the Earth and can reap wealth or chaos among us. Spirits take many forms, sometimes anthropomorphic, sometimes only partially corporeal. This one here has collected jewellery, gold, and peratin leaves, as they are fiercely attracted to precious metals. Just as we dress up for them, peaceful spirits will dress up for us and mimic parts of our bodies. <em>Sprites</em> (as opposed to spirits) are smaller, more emotional, and are fragments of reproduction &ndash; think of them like spores of ferns, of the pollen of flowers. You can see a small one floating beside the spirit.</p>
<p><em>Christ</em> was the first and only time that God is recorded to have walked among the living. He might visit the spirit world often; Tzipora wouldn‚Äôt know. As a creator and guide for humans, He was born as a human and taught ways to live well. Humanity is very young and is still learning to live on the Earth. The ritual of communion is a way of reminding us that We are in His image, and We are unworthy. He died for our sins; sins Tzipora is very sure will eventually usurp Him altogether in whatever deicidal sci-fi utopia she&rsquo;s got going on in her head.</p>
<p>Then, there are <em>humans</em> themselves. Here, Tzipora is in full costume designed for religious ceremony to talk to spirits. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/8lqzuj/the_dress_code_for_talking_to_spirits/">You can read more about the costume here</a>. She might ask for rains, or a long summer, or for the forest to return a missing child. Food offerings are presented. She forms a whole rune with her body as part of <em>Upotenne</em>, or the language of spirits. <em>Upotenne</em> itself is an ancient type of <em>Potenne</em>, which is modern Vekllei sign language. This is a calming rune, indicating maternal affection, and you can see the written hieroglyph appears visually similar to the pose.</p>
<p>Finally, demons walk the Earth and can manifest in many different ways. This one has taken the form of a girl, and carries the severed head of a goat. Its eyelids are painted with ritualistic eyes in mockery of proper funeral rites. They often wander aimlessly through uninhabited areas, as noise in intolerable to most demons. They are mysterious creatures, and their purpose is unknown. They come from the place spirits go to die. Like apex predators, they wander aimlessly and without purpose, hunting and feeding at random. They are feeble in physical forms, with one exception: they can form physical runes quickly and maliciously. The one cast here is an omen of suffering (translated literally as &lsquo;harpoiseanin&rsquo;, or overpowering the body with its own stomach acids). In Vekllei, a &lsquo;demon&rsquo; is any biplanar or otherwise supernatural creature that takes corporeal form and harms folk directly. Spirits can maim and kill, but only through the forces of nature &ndash; a demon attacks physically. There are many types of demons, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/97sckc/old_dead_demons_still_wander_the_countryside/">and you can read more about them here</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about Upen, just ask. You can read more about Vekllei by clicking on my profile or visiting <a href="http://www.vekllei.city/">www.vekllei.city</a>! Thanks for stopping by!</p>
<p>-&ndash;</p>
<p><strong>Post scriptum</strong>: Upen is also the reason Vekllei does not recognise either private or public property, and was actually the inspiration for making this post. Although many people exert &lsquo;ownership&rsquo;, the concept of property as something other than &rsquo;nature&rsquo; is not recognised, and so society in Vekllei remains thoroughly decommodified. Looking at Vekllei through the lens of Upen, it becomes clear that a moneyless domestic economy is not the product of grand secular collectivist ideals but a natural extension of egalitarian environmentalism; essentially urbanised agrarian socialism.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/militaryfashion.jpg"/> <p><strong>Unlike the United States and Western Europe, the ‚Äòteen-ager‚Äô has not been discovered in Vekllei.</strong> To be pedantic, they do technically exist  ‚Äî  their people do indeed enter a transitory stage between childhood and adulthood, as far as anyone can tell ‚Äî  but they do not exist as a separate cultural identity. The teen-age person in Vekllei is immersed in adult economic and social relationships, and so they have no real cultural material of their own. They listen to the music of their parents, raise younger siblings, and generally marry young. I could go on for a while about things Vekllei has not ‚Äòdiscovered‚Äô (read: commodified through modernity); landscape, childhood, history, etc. But let‚Äôs stick with teen-agers for now.</p>
<p>By sexual maturation, a Vekllei person has essentially transitioned to young-adulthood and submerged themselves in the productive relations of the adult age; they often leave school for work, they quickly drift to mature, independent relationships with parents, and otherwise carve out lives in their wondrous country. All of this is not to say that the country lacks materials aimed at young people entirely  ‚Äî  you can‚Äôt fit a middle-aged woman into a sixteen-year-old‚Äôs dress, no matter how much she might try  ‚Äî  but I am simply trying to establish an understanding that folk here do not enjoy the glamour (or what was once glamour) of American teen-agers, with sock-hops and convertible cars and magazines.</p>
<p>Tangentially related, as Vekllei society has militarised in the face of nuclear war, so too has fashion adopted a bayonet‚Äôs edge. In womens fashion, we‚Äôre seeing the reemergence of ‚Äòdazzle‚Äô camouflage in imitation of her great capital ships. Jackets, skirts, jewellery, hats, are all being manufactured in flavours of it, and are often <em>touspian</em> or ‚Äòpastelised‚Äô into designs and colours considered more feminine. In men, military caps and ties are popular in semiformal social outfits, and often complement suits. The country is already heavily uniformed in the workplace, and has a passion for badges and armbands and decorative knick-knacks, and so a lot of these authoritative trinkets are trickling into everyday fashion.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs easy to despair at the militarisation of society, and a warhawk fashion culture, but it could also be seen as a critical modernist/postmodern attack on the traditional institutions that are so integral to life and culture in Vekllei society. In sharp dresses women wear armbands embroidered with brands of soup, men wear faux-military badges displaying ridiculous illustrations  ‚Äî  while not outright political perhaps, they are certainly appropriating the imagery of war and domesticating it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tzipora here is sixteen, waiting for a first date, and patterned with the dazzle of the <em>Sundress</em> nuclear-equipped capital ship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven‚Äôt really felt out my thoughts fully on the subject of teen-age life and its introduction to Western society, so if ya got any ideas leave a comment. I‚Äôm also building a website, <a href="http://www.vekllei.city/">www.vekllei.city</a>, but it‚Äôs a bit shit at the moment. I‚Äôm slowly cementing its style and turning it into a proper wiki, so check back soon!</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/southerncollapse.jpg"/> <p><strong>In October of 2074</strong>, the Ford Motor Company was embroiled in political catastrophe after Vermont senator Henry Walsh accused unionism in its East-Coast plants of traitorism by allowing foreign spies to acquire jobs in the Company. Whether the spies were Soviet or Chinese changed several times in Walsh‚Äôs accusations, but the claims themselves were not entirely unfounded. An investigation by the FBI received by congress found that several high-ranking Auto Workers Union members in Ford plants had connections to communist organisations, which were then discovered to have smuggled foreign agents into the country.</p>
<p>The recognition of Ford as a traitorous company, combined with an ailing combustion-engine automobile catalogue, sank the company into receivership and then bankruptcy. In a few short weeks, the titan of American industry, and the grandfather of mass-production, had ceased to exist except in name (which was acquired by Chrysler and branded tokenistically on several models of Chrysler vehicles).</p>
<p>Forty-thousand jobs disappeared by the new year. The economy was bad and the plants of the company were unsold and were bleached by the sun. The Southern states, which had served as primary hubs of the auto industry after Detroit‚Äôs collapse a decade before, saw unemployment jump ten percent. Is it any surprise what followed?</p>
<p>It would be misleading to categorise everything that has happened since as a consequence of the Ford Motor Company‚Äôs collapse, but in the minds of most Americans  ‚Äî  and most importantly, blue-collar men of the Southern States  ‚Äî  it was the beginning of the end for the Union, and the secession of the Southern States from the United States four years later had rolled off the back of the economic collapse spurred by Ford.</p>
<p>Hungry and anguished by economic collapse, and increasing fragmentation of Southern culture as cities, companies and universities diversified culturally, Southerners found conspiracy in many sectors of modern American life. There were Jews, who controlled big money in the East Coast cities and relished the South&rsquo;s failures. There were capitalists, who were often conflated with Jews as enemies of the noble small business community. There was the Federal Government itself, and a cabal of socialists, communists and leftists who had wrought their jealousy upon the south. And there were blacks and hispanics, who were brothers in victimhood or conspirators depending on what county you were in.</p>
<p>Although the South would gain some measure of independence after the heat of the fighting had tapered out, the Southern States would never fully recover, and both the secessionist and Union states continued to maintain a single U.S. military.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/olduniforms.jpg"/> <p>From preschool to university and beyond, all students wear a variant of the same uniform. The kindergartners may not wear a full <em>gi</em> and camisole pinafore, but the basic ensemble is still there. This is the girl‚Äôs one, and it‚Äôs much more elaborate than the boy‚Äôs uniform.</p>
<p>Year-round, all students wear a <strong>school armband</strong> with their year and class embroidered on it and a <strong>badge of education</strong>, which is pinned to the top button. Girls wear a selection of other traditional items.</p>
<p>The <strong>gi</strong> is a ceremonial quarter-pleat worn by schoolgirls and the wider public generally. It is usually embroidered for the festival month it was made in, and many Vekllei girls have several gi for different celebratory months (birth month, blood month, shipbuilder‚Äôs month, etc). In summer it is also common to wear a <strong>sun petticoat</strong>, a delicate lace petticoat worn exposed beneath the hem of the skirt. These are often handmade. Traditionally hair is pulled into a <strong>fountain hairpiece</strong> if it is long enough, and can accompany <strong>temple hairpieces</strong> as well. These hairstyles trace back to the spirit priestesses and have become fashionable again.</p>
<p>In winter, both boys and girls wear a <strong>half cape</strong> for Vekllei‚Äôs miserable winter months. These are usually wool and lined with insulating materials. Girls also wear a <strong>camisole pinafore</strong>, which is essentially a traditional girl‚Äôs camisole that is tucked into the skirt to make a dress for the winter months.</p>
<p>Armbands, badges, half capes and gi are worn in many other industries as well, since nearly every company employs a uniformed staff. It is common for a girl to hold a gi from her middle-school years, where it is oversized and clumsy, all the way to graduation and then employment.</p>
<p>For those wondering what happens to valuable metals and gemstones in a moneyless society like Vekllei, you simply have to look a little closer  ‚Äî  they are often sewn into badges and ceremonial clothes. Stripped of their commodity, they have become precious and sacred items that bejewel important objects. The badge of education, for example, contains a ruby in its heart.</p>
<p>None of this stops roughhousing, and Tzipora‚Äôs just beat the shit out of a girl who called her a lesbian.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/comix.jpg"/> <p><strong>There are some comics that Vekllei syndicates just won‚Äôt publish</strong>. <em>KID Magazine</em>, or <em>KID Comix</em> ran for nearly a century. It was picked up and dropped by dozens of anonymous artists, writers and editors, all operating under nonsense pseudonyms  ‚Äî  Red, Squick, Failson and Daddy Fun were some of the longest-serving. It would go out of print for years, until some contributing artist would revive the mailing list and recruit new editors and writers. Not even editors knew the names of their team  ‚Äî  and so <em>KID</em> became a rag-tag, pornographic, angry, satire comic published anonymously anywhere from biannually to a dozen times a year and distributed through universities, underground comics syndicates and workplaces. A single copy might be repressed dozens of times and redistributed further, making original copies collector‚Äôs items.</p>
<p><em>Issue 36</em> blasted Vekllei munitions trade with the United States, which was by this point gripped by economic collapse as the industrial centres of the South were levelled by poverty and fighting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The comic is not subtle: a stereotypical Vekllei girl complete with <em>gi</em> and fountain hairpiece offers an artillery shell to a deformed pigman soldier carrying the U.S. flag and an atom bomb. The girl wears the national flower on her apron. The pigman sits atop a throne of food and corpses, as he himself decomposes. Subtitled in English by Squick: ‚ÄúJust let the fucker DIE‚Äù.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article inside parodied the sitting U.S. President, W. E. White, using Vekllei munitions as sex toys before one of them detonates and he flies off into the moon.</p>
<p>Such was the tone of the magazine, one of the most important examples of underground comix culture in the world and a landmark training ground for successful comix artists.</p>
<p>Post scriptum: Tzipora was introduced to <em>KID</em> through a contributing writer at her university. As a fluent English speaker she served for some time as <em>KID</em>‚Äôs first and only English editor, and would later contribute both art and articles to the magazine.</p>
<p><em>Let me know if you have any questions!</em></p>

<p><strong>A fluorescent light burst on Thursday</strong>. She was stacking cans for a display. The girl was working alone that evening and leaving her mark everywhere  ‚Äî  happy apple drawings, new posters, displays  ‚Äî  she liked the job.</p>
<p>The light burst like a gunshot and she leapt to her feet. Down the aisle she saw herself, at the lowest point in her life, standing over an old friend. To say she had shot him would be misleading  ‚Äî  she had executed him, point-blank. He was bleeding into the sandwiches with flaps of skin stirring weakly on the back of his head.</p>
<p>The store evaporated and the girl was back in Cherry, Nevada. He was trying to leave in the middle of the night. She‚Äôd followed him and confronted him. She‚Äôd asked the same question over and over as she had held the gun out. ‚ÄòAre you going to the Soviets?‚Äô</p>
<p>He told her he was hoping to secure armaments for the Wolves, and that with clean clothes and Soviet support they could launch bigger things  ‚Äî  better things. Ambushes, bombings, even assist the Militias in real rebellion.</p>
<p>He was lying, of course. He was going to the Soviets because the anarchists were all dead, and he would be too if he didn‚Äôt run. That was enough for her. She didn‚Äôt shoot him for lying. She shot him for desertion.</p>
<p>The memory had ruined her life, and here it was, triggered by one of so many things that reminded her of that time in the desert. When she was back in the supermarket, sweating like a pig, she picked up the can she‚Äôd dropped and went back to work.</p>
<p>It was all exaggerated in her head. The boy had covered half the aisle in blood! That wasn‚Äôt how the whole thing went down. In the desert she‚Äôd shot him from a few feet back, and there had been a red mist but it didn‚Äôt touch her. He didn‚Äôt splatter none. He went into the ground and bounced off it, kicking as his whole body went haywire, before he went still on the ground. The back of his head spurted once, like a man pissing nervous, and then it bubbled and trickled out of the hole in his head like a drinking fountain as he set to work emptying as many of his litres as he could manage before his organs died. The blood didn‚Äôt fucking shine on tiled floors, either. It soaked into the desert. When they moved him, a sweet rose of colour was in the heart of it, red in the sand, but the wide stain was damp and grey and innocent.</p>
<p>She didn‚Äôt sleep much that week, goes without saying.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The following concerns Vekllei‚Äôs domestic economy, fair warning.</strong></p>
<p>Supermarkets are relatively rare in Vekllei, especially compared to the States. Like many command economies, Vekllei‚Äôs internal economy requires total employment. Supermarkets are too automated, and so distribution is usually decentralised among many smaller grocers that can be found on nearly every street. These are what we would consider private enterprises, although Vekllei does not make a distinction between public and private.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Senrouive</em> types of workplaces are distinct from <em>Venrouiva</em> as <em>private</em> or <em>personal</em> business. This is not the same as ‚Äòprivate‚Äô property, as we understand it. Vekllei does not actually make any distinction of property ‚Äî everything belongs to the land, including the country. Vekllei does not use money, either. Instead, anything self-operating and nonessential to the operation of the country is <em>Senrouive</em>. Restaurants, cinemas, department stores, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So despite the fact that Vekllei does not use money, grocers benefit from having first pick of goods. There are no real shortages of essential foods in Vekllei, but seasonal and otherwise special produce  ‚Äî  like that made for festivals or imported from abroad  ‚Äî  are often in short supply. If you like your food, being a grocer is a good place to start. Occasionally it can also be difficult to obtain special types of ordinary produce ‚Äî flavoured ham or fruit yogurts, for example.</p>
<p>‚ÄòFirst pick‚Äô is less a gift of the economy to Grocers than it is just a natural conclusion of Vekllei‚Äôs moneyless system. Tzipora works at only fourteen, not because she needs spending money or because she wants to climb a food-prep or managerial ladder, but because she‚Äôs bored and wearing an apron and badge gives her a small sense of importance, even if she only impresses the handful of regulars that stop by. There is no real value in professionalism in Vekllei, so work hours are very casual and many business close frequently for lunch, afternoon tea, and pre-closing celebration. Most shopkeeps will only give you a passing nod from behind from their paperback when you enter a store.</p>
<p>At first glance, Vekllei‚Äôs shelves look like that of any other Western country, but the actual purpose of advertising and posters are pure theatrics  ‚Äî  they are superficial imitations of an American supermarket with all its colour and splendour  ‚Äî  the entire purpose of advertising goods it so soak up work-hours of some marketing graduate on his way to bigger and better things. The labels on the cans are just labels.</p>

And the promises these things bring  ‚Äî  of family, of love, of fucking, of heritage, of mourning  ‚Äî  so too are they stolen from her. So if in her native culture her blood defines her, then what definition does she have? Her womanhood is rotted, it is sick, and she is incomplete.</p>
<p>Part of her wonders if the spirits can sense it, too. They seem to flock to her, like demons, as though they can sense she only has one foot in the corporeal world. Is there a reason why blood demons ignore her? And why, on entrance to the spirit world, did the spirits filled her lungs with blood? Maybe these things are just coincidences, but nonetheless‚Ä¶</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be thankful of your blood. Be proud of your bloodline, and when you bleed, acknowledge that what drips from you is everything you are. Some girls, like Zelda here, have to remind themselves that they are human to make it through the day.</p>

<p><strong>She met herself out by the shrine, many summers ago</strong>. At first she didn‚Äôt know what it was  ‚Äî  she thought it might be a spirit, or  ‚Äî  and she caught herself in the thought, because she was only half a child  ‚Äî  a little part of her wondered if it was a manifestation of God, or Christ, come to help solve her problems. The idea was ridiculous. She believed it was just a forest spirit, and this was probably its shrine.</p>
<p>The copy emerged out of the bushes, and she stared at herself. It moved like she did; clumsy and ungraceful. She apologised for disturbing it, and presented her food offering.</p>
<p>As she watched it approach, a knot caught in her stomach. The thing was looking right at her. The food was ignored. She recoiled and frowned at it.</p>
<p>‚ÄòWhat are you?‚Äô she asked, or something to that effect. ‚ÄòAn angel? I‚Äôm not dying. Are you a psychopomp? I‚Äôm not gonna kill myself, so you don‚Äôt need to be here.‚Äô</p>
<p>It kept on walking over, and she noticed the skin of the copy had faded like an old photograph.</p>
<p>‚ÄòDid you hear me? I don‚Äôt need your help.‚Äô</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such was her first and only direct encounter with a <em>ganger</em>, an old form of demon that has been driven out long ago from here through industry and agriculture.</p>
<p>They come from the place spirits go to die, and so they carry diseases and misfortune their shoulders. When they take the form of folk out here, they act as an ‚Äòidol‚Äô, in a sense, to worship the self  ‚Äî  they feed off the bad thoughts of wanderers, take control of good memories, and manifest them physically to feed.</p>
<p>In seeing a copy of themselves, many people mistake it for a vision, or a spiritual epiphany. They will destroy themselves if they accept it. Tzipora is not such a fool  ‚Äî  and she‚Äôs out here to leave those good memories far behind her, where they belong. She swings, drawing blood punching at herself, and the apparition disappears. The morning after, she wakes up with blood soaked through her pillow, and a nasty nosebleed.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/princessoftheearth.jpg"/> <p>They never actually believed that she was any kind of princess. They never even joked about it. The original LIFE magazine article said that she <em>looked</em> as though she were ‚Äòa princess of the Earth‚Äô when interviewer Alfie Ricci met her in the Vekllei highlands, and so she carried that name as a burden for the next few hundred years.</p>
<p>There are many Gregori children alive today, and we have seen the miracle of the first few dozen start to wear off. Gregori Hordiyenko, the little Ukrainian boy whose namesake was adopted by his disease, died age 27 in a car accident. Many others of the &ldquo;first dozen&rdquo; committed suicide, were killed by disease, died from complications arising from the genetic function of the syndrome, and a disproportionate number were born into the third world, where they were eliminated by famine, displacement or superstition.</p>
<p>Tzipora Desmoines, Vekllei‚Äôs first and only Gregori baby, was born in 2063. By the time of her LIFE interview, she was sixty-two years old. Yet she remains as she was on the eve of her menarche  ‚Äî  fourteen, prepubescent, and largely miserable.</p>
<p>When you meet her for the first time, you have no idea how to talk to her. Is she a young teen-ager, or a sixty year old woman? A lot of her patient and soft-spoken quality is misinterpreted as a product of age, but nothing could be further from the truth  ‚Äî  which is that Tzipora is largely the same girl as she was in 2077, but the spirit and vigour of her teen-age years and childhood curiosity have been stretched unnaturally over decades, blunting her passion and enthusiasm in all things. To the handful of people left alive that she loves, she can be as childish as ever, but the ghosts that dominate her regrets and favourite memories are starting to overcome her.</p>
<p>She is a rare case, despite thousands of boys and girls now like her across the world. She was born in a brief period where Gregori babies were born fairly healthy and independent, save for their obvious genetic malfunction. Today, among the hundreds that are born each year, nearly all of them suffer from broad anaphylaxis that renders them fragile and useless. In theory, all Gregori children will live forever save a car or the rope doesn‚Äôt get them, but as the children born with the syndrome become more and more sick very few that are born today will live beyond a normal human lifespan.</p>
<p>As for Tzipora  ‚Äî  in seventy years she will become the oldest human ever, living or dead.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/blacksand.jpg"/> <p>Just as Iceland&rsquo;s initial history was reshaped into the image of Vekllei some centuries ago, so too has the real-world climate and weather been altered. Cool Icelandic summers have been usurped by volatile days that can be as low as 5C (40F) or as hot as 30C (85F+). Technically speaking, the unstable Atlantic pressure oscillation, of which Vekllei anchors as the Vekllei low pole, can pull in bitter cold from the Greenland currents, or warmth from the Azores tempestuously.</p>
<p>So it is that in summer, on a beach of black igneous sand from the volcanoes of this place, hot rains can descend instantly and beat pedestrians until the rains vanish, minutes later. Winters are equally unstable  ‚Äî  they shift between unlivable cold and sporadic thawing periods.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This unusual climate is not unique to Vekllei. Europe is fucked, meteorologically speaking, by a series of el nino summers and instant winters that wrack Germany, Austria, Italy, and so forth. The Adriatic seems to see more gloom than mediterranean sun these days.</p>
<p>The equatorial deserts of the world, Nevada included, are mere degrees away from unsurvivable. With temperatures frequently breaking 50C (125F) throughout the year, it thins the population of Southerners too old or too poor to avoid the heat.</p>
<p>North Africa is a husk. There is no water and no food. There is a reason there are mass graves all across the shores of the Black Sea, and why Europe tastes the boot. There is a reason the southern African states are crumbling.</p>
<p>East Asia is hot and wet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So these girls march on in the summer rain-storms, not quite conscious of the ridiculousness of enjoying one of the world‚Äôs more temperate climates in a country they once called Iceland.</p>

Hello all,
The question on the mind of folks around the world is that of Gregori Children. What are they? What does it mean, to be a ‚ÄúGregori Baby‚Äù?
Gregori Regenerative Syndrome is a developmental phenomenon that afflicts children and young teen-agers. It holds them in a prepubescent state, and so they do not grow old like you and I.]]>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/floating.jpg"/> <p><em>Did you know  ‚Äî  many Gregori children do not form calluses on their skin, because of the intensity of their epidermic regeneration process!</em></p>
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>The question on the mind of folks around the world is that of Gregori Children. What are they? What does it <em>mean</em>, to be a ‚ÄúGregori Baby‚Äù?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gregori Regenerative Syndrome is a developmental phenomenon that afflicts children and young teen-agers. It holds them in a prepubescent state, and so they do not grow old like you and I.</p>
<p>Of the thousands of Gregori children now living in our world today, over 90 per cent of them are girls. They develop normally until an unknown point between thelarche (the beginning of puberty and the development of breasts) and menarche (a girl‚Äôs first period). In boys, this timeline is technically different but chronologically similar  ‚Äî  and always before sexual maturation. Girls in Vekllei might expect menarche as late as fourteen-sixteen (a fact that continues to emphasise the myth of Vekllei virgin purity), whereas boys will likely cease development a few years earlier, usually twelve-fourteen.</p>
<p>Gregori girls can often take the appearance of young teen-agers; they may develop breasts and grow body hair, although these phenomena are not universal among the afflicted. Nonetheless, they have not actually entered puberty proper  ‚Äî  estrogen is not shaping their bodies, and they will remain sterile for the rest of their lives. Boys are similar, although are usually shorter and more childlike in appearance at the onset of the Gregori process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>So what does being Gregori actually mean</em>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It means the natural biological development of these children and teen-agers has ceased and their bodies have entered an unnatural cellular cycle, which halts the ageing process and renders them immortal, at least in theory. Technically, they are still growing  ‚Äî  nonregenerative tissue and organs are still growing, like the brain  ‚Äî  but they are captured in this state forever. Doctors put the blame on a faulty genetic regenerative process, hidden somewhere in their DNA, but the exact cause is unknown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Do they have superpowers?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing of the sort, unfortunately! Existential questions aside, the syndrome can be as much a burden as a miracle. For example, although all Gregori children are immune to cancers and similar cellular malfunction, around 80 per cent of them suffer broad anaphylaxis, meaning that almost all foreign matter triggers an overzealous autoimmune response. This can be fatal, and the ratio of children born with Gregori anaphylaxis has only risen in recent years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Are there any dangers to being Gregori?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gregori teen-agers and children have a high turnover of cells, and some bones do not properly fuse. This renders many of the afflicted delicate and fragile  ‚Äî  especially children halted at a younger age. The condition is not known to affect emotional or psychological traits of the afflicted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The future implications of Gregori syndrome are limitless  ‚Äî  ignoring the secret of immortality, the ability to regenerate vital brain, spinal, and optical tissues would revolutionise medicine. Today, there are many thousands of Gregori children in the world, and so the question of their own future remains  ‚Äî  <strong>are they a genetic abnormality, or the next wave of human evolution?</strong></p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/bloodname.jpg"/> <p>Each person in Vekllei has three names  ‚Äî  a <strong>given name</strong> (Tzipora), a <strong>surname</strong> (Desmoines), and an alternative given name as part of <em>rapotenne</em> (potenne is ‚Äòhandtalk‚Äô, upotenne is ‚Äòspirit-talk‚Äô, and so it follows that rapotenne is the language system of names). This alternative name is a ‚Äòkey‚Äô to the full blood name of an individual, which are given in secret by the mother traditionally, but can be gifted by any mother-figure.</p>
<p>For all intents and purposes, ‚Äò<strong>Tzipora Desmoines</strong>‚Äô works exactly as ‚ÄòJohn Smith‚Äô  ‚Äî  a distinguishing name and the ancestral name. In Vekllei, the men take the name of the child-bearer.</p>
<p>Tzipora‚Äôs blood name, her <em>rapotenne</em>, instead reads as: <strong>Zelda lo Ula Desmoines</strong>. This is a name she should never reveal until her death, so rites can be performed.</p>
<p>Although Vekllei‚Äôs monarchy is long dead, ancestors are still held sacred by these people. They hold ancient family names that tie their blood to the earth. They are also used when talking with spirits, as they are part of <em>upotenne</em>, the external language of the soul. In this sense, blood names operate as a sacred vocal rune.</p>
<p>Pictured above is Tzipora receiving her blood name from a father-figure many years ago. Since she has no bloodline left alive, he fulfills the role of a father and gives her a name constructed of several parts, researched and tailored to her.</p>
<ol>
<li>Zelda is a nickname and a moniker Tzipora has used to hide her Jewishness, and so works perfectly as a public ‚Äòkey‚Äô to her blood name.</li>
<li>lo Ula (her blood of Ula in upotenne) is her ancient, sacred title. The name-giver has not been able to trace her blood to the times of spirits, so he‚Äôs traced it as far back as he could and scoured that region for a proper title. Ula is a combination of two words  ‚Äî  Ura, a type of bare, wind-swept coastal shelf in Northern Vekllei, where Tzipora‚Äôs bloodlines originate, and the Vekllei word for iceberg. It also links to an ancient Vekllei saga  ‚Äî  in which a proud and mighty iceberg is reduced to ice-pebbles after being dashed against the northern rocks. A story of mortality, it is a warning for Tzipora, who does not age.</li>
<li>Desmoines is the family name, unchanged for centuries, and is fairly common in Vekllei.</li>
</ol>
<p>I‚Äôm really enjoying exploring more of Vekllei‚Äôs traditions. Let me know if you have any questions, about these language systems, Tzipora, or anything.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/religiousuniform.jpg"/> <p><strong>In Vekllei animism</strong>, which branches into a vast and complex set of beliefs and traditions that vary from village to village, there is no formal religious structure. Temples and shrines pay respect to <strong>sprites</strong>, which are universally understood as bi-planar creatures. There is no formal religious structure, and so animistic tradition has no priests.</p>
<p>Ceremonial dress is simple to describe, but complex to assemble. The shape and form of the dress, including <em>cascade peplums</em> (a series of peplums that hang over the skirt of the dress) and sun petticoats are traditional, but they hold no religious value outside of the connection to your ancestors who performed the same rites before you. Tradition is very important in Vekllei.</p>
<p>Sprites, and to a lesser extent <strong>spirits</strong>, are fiercely attracted to supernatural colour and shine (polished gemstones, plastics, metals, etc). Pure and natural metals are most alluring to the sprites, as they hold the lustre of the Earth (as well as exude undetectable submagnetic fields called <em>ecec</em>) but they can be substituted with synthetic gold and bronze, as can gemstones, all of which are mass-produced in the industrial city centres of Vekllei.</p>
<p>To meet a sprite, and offer it food, you should dress in these materials. Often villages will collectively maintain traditional outfits for talking to sprites, some of which are hundreds of years old and require care to put on. Sprites can see like you and me, so covering yourself in gold won‚Äôt simply do the trick  ‚Äî  you should dress neatly and politely. It is not necessary to purge yourself of all modern things  ‚Äî  wristwatches, shoes, hairpieces are all fine, as long as you‚Äôve taken care in your appearance.</p>
<p>Appease a <strong>sprite</strong>, and you might notice lost items turning up, and cracked roof tiles begin to sparkle like new. To befriend a <strong>spirit</strong> is to have plenty to harvest that season, as well as protection from heavy rains.</p>
<p><strong>Tzipora Zelda Desmoines</strong>, miracle girl of the village of <strong>Montre-Lola</strong>, holds a pose in <em>upotenne</em>: the physical language of spirits. As <em>potenne</em> supplements language in Vekllei with sign gestures, <em>upotenne</em> turns your body into an ancient rune, and protects the site from disturbing fields that might scare a sprite. It‚Äôs not necessary to hold it for long  ‚Äî  just acknowledge it. This one performed by Tzipora predates Vekllei language and script  ‚Äî  no one today can speak it. It lives on today only in physical form, and in that moment time collapses and she is in this place with her ancestors.</p>
<p><em>Just a quick sketch. Let me know if you have any questions</em>.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/policecar.jpg"/> <p><strong>Hopefully you won‚Äôt have to worry about the police while you‚Äôre in Vekllei</strong>, but you‚Äôll likely notice them. Police are everywhere  ‚Äî  as an alternative to military (<em>duoroten</em>) service, conscripts can elect to enter domestic security <em>(inrote</em>n). Most officers are young, bored, and live in the community they police. You‚Äôll likely be talking to them at some point in your visit, even if it‚Äôs only to ask for directions  ‚Äî  in Vekllei, cops are the bulletin boards of the community.</p>
<p>All beat cops are unarmed, and carry extendable truncheons that swing from their belt. Much more rarely, you‚Äôll see professional officers  ‚Äî  you‚Äôll notice them, because they ride in cars. Professional officers travel in pairs, and the senior officer is known as a <em>firearm officer</em>, and will carry a sidearm.</p>
<p>Should you be detained by police, keep the following in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Vekllei is a casual culture.</strong> Some officers will speak English, but the concept of ‚Äòsir‚Äô has never entered their vocabulary. They will approach and interact with you casually  ‚Äî  professionalism operates differently here. Nor will they bow to you, except in stations. If you act hysterical, they will cease to take you seriously. Keep your cool, be friendly, talk clearly.</li>
<li><strong>Vekllei is a physical culture</strong>. Police will touch, pull, and push you without communicating. This is not an intimate or aggressive gesture  ‚Äî  they will just as soon pull you out of the thoroughfare of a sidewalk as restrain you.</li>
<li><strong>Vekllei police do not heavily employ firearms, but are liberal with the baton</strong>. Only when responding to a firearm call will police approach with a firearm in hand. Otherwise, they will rest a baton on their shoulder and are trained to use it against you, should you attempt to fight them. In a country without currency, there is no such thing as ‚Äòdamages‚Äô. Public drunkenness is not tolerated in Vekllei and is not an excuse for fighting with police.</li>
</ol>
<p>With all that said, Vekllei has an extremely low crime rate and it is very unlikely you‚Äôll ever see cops responding to a crime. More often you‚Äôll see them escorting other emergency service vehicles through pedestrian streets, arguing with locals and doing odd jobs around the community. Especially in rural communities, there is very little distinction between on and off-duty cops, and beat cops will often wear their uniform around town while unassigned to a shift.</p>
<p>In the picture above we see professional cops, or <em>copa</em>, watching a suspect from across the street. We can tell they are professional officers because they wear red and white uniforms, instead of the navy, red and white of beat cops. The woman is a firearm officer, and carries a revolver in her holster. The man is not armed but carries a baton on his shoulder.</p>
<p>The police car, a <em>Model 10 (Special)</em>, sits low to the ground, weighed with a 60MWe Molten Salt Reactor where we‚Äôd usually find the trunk. The car has a theoretical top speed of 400km/h, but will never reach anywhere close to that  ‚Äî  pursuits are extremely rare in the country, as almost no-one has a personal automobile. On its roof it carries two cherry lights and a single <em>Dura</em> wailer siren. The service number, 6, tells us that the unit is from the Montre region.</p>
<p>As for the suspect? A small domestic fight between a grocer and his daughter fizzled out and they both apologised to the officers and community for wasting their time.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/bowing.jpg"/> <p><strong>Vekllei has a pan-pacific flavour of greeting, usually a bow followed by a handshake.</strong> If you‚Äôre going to fit in, you‚Äôre going to have to learn how to do it right. Let‚Äôs get started.</p>
<p>First, Vekllei is extremely physical in its language. Not expressive, like how you might picture an Italian or American. Instead, it incorporates an auxiliary language called <em>potenne</em> or, ‚ÄòHand-Talk‚Äô, which accompanies words. A forefinger sliding across a forefinger is ‚Äògood‚Äô or, ‚Äòacknowledged‚Äô, and can be used with verbalising the word or as a signal.</p>
<p>Similarly, bowing takes on elements of potenne. There are hundreds of ways to bow, but there are a few basic rules that will make your time in Vekllei easier.</p>
<ol>
<li>The angle of the bow determines the seriousness of the gesture. A ninety-degree bow is most-serious, used for meeting foreigners of importance, apologising profusely, or welcoming a prestigious guest. In modern Vekllei, where mateship has displaced traditional hierarchy, it is rarely used except in service of others. Most common is fifteen degrees, with a maximum of forty-five in polite, formal conversation.</li>
<li>You must not speak while bowing. The act is a word in itself and it is loud and obnoxious to speak and act. Welcome, or apologise, or thank the partner. Then bow.</li>
<li>Formal bowing, as employed in serious or dire times as a collective action, is taken on the knees on the floor. The head is pressed against the ground. Those unable to kneel can lower their heads. The most obvious example of this for the reader is in the ten-minutes mourning following the <em>Lola</em> nuclear attack, when every able-bodied citizen faced the district and bowed in honour of the dead.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let‚Äôs observe <strong>Tzipora Zelda Desmoines</strong>, miracle girl of Montre-Lola, in three types of bowing you are most likely to encounter in your travels.</p>
<ol>
<li>With hands interlocked, hanging parallel to the legs, the greeting bow is most common and works as a friendly gesture. Make sure to lock your fingers properly. Only with foreigners will you bow with your arms straight by your sides, so make sure to let the arms dangle perpendicular to your legs.</li>
<li>To apologise, or excuse yourself, place your fingers gently on your neck and bow to the degree it is appropriate. Close your eyes. If the person has more to say, release your hands from the back of your neck, listen, then repeat the gesture.</li>
<li>A welcome bow, employed as a gesture of solidarity, welcomes you into homes and places of business. This is not a ‚Äòhello‚Äô, this is a, ‚Äòhow may I serve you?‚Äô. Forms fists with your hands and place them over your chest. Do not bow your head, and keep eye contact with the partner. It is unusual for foreigners to perform this bow, unless they are employed in some capacity. In Vekllei, this translates more literally to greetings, mate,‚Äô and the service is implied.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind that Vekllei does not use honourifics, and supplements titles with bows. These are important. Use them luxuriously, and have fun! Vekllei people will appreciate the gesture from a foreigner.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/coldweather.jpg"/> <p>Welcome to Vekllei. It is a strange country with a complex culture that is quite distinct (and sometimes outrageous) to Western countries. This will be a long post. I‚Äôve tried to keep it clear.</p>
<hr>
<p>Women in Vekllei usually wear skirts in winter. There are cultural and historical reasons for this, explained below. Pictured here is Tzipora in a winter Vekllei outfit so typical it works well enough here to give a show-and-tell. The outfit consists of underwear (vest, stockings/socks, etc.), an inner lace petticoat, a cotton thermal pettiskirt, and a wool outer skirt. They reach about the mid-shin. She wears a thick cotton shirt over her vest and a rayon cardigan on top, with cotton gloves. Although not pictured here, when heading out a long wool overcoat would protect from the fierce Vekllei wind.</p>
<p>The colours are not wintery, but that requires context. The history of language and gender are not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea, but if you want to know more, let‚Äôs get started.</p>
<hr>
<p>Winters in Vekllei are long and dark. In the depths of it the sun rises only for about an hour. Temperatures range between 5 and -15 centigrade. By all accounts it is not a place for skirts.</p>
<p>But many women don‚Äôt consider thick or multilayered trousers. This is because womanhood is tied very clearly to physical appearance. Vekllei lacks gender pronouns entirely, but has very clear feminine and masculine words. Vekllei written language is logographic, and so you ‚Äòconstruct‚Äô concepts out of images. So certain gender concepts, like femininity, are constructed out of feminine associations that ‚Äòbuild‚Äô a sensation and understanding of what it means to be female. Skirts are a part of that. To feel like a woman in Vekllei, there are explicit images that build femininity.</p>
<p><strong>That is not to say Vekllei is necessarily misogynist</strong>, at least as we understand it through a Western lens  ‚Äî  the political and cultural understanding of the country (usually called ‚Äòpetticoat socialism‚Äô) strongly suggests that our fundamental ‚Äòhuman‚Äô traits are inherently female.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It emphasises the overall ‚Äòfemininity‚Äô of humanity and shifts the human core to female, and then distinguishes masculine traits as radical and far from the centre of the human condition. Petticoat feminism takes on economic qualities and a radical reading of gender to describe its main point of function and praxis  ‚Äî  that masculine qualities are inherently economic, and that they will cease to be masculine as petticoat socialism achieves its aim of rendering labour unnecessary for all reasons except self-satisfaction. In petticoat feminism, the final form of the human race is female  ‚Äî  not in a biological sense, but in a cultural attitude that has essentially ceased to distinguish between masculine and feminine qualities, while retaining what it views as inherently female virtues.</p>
<p>Fragility, grace, beauty, leisure, and reproduction are placed upon the shoulders of men, rendering them ‚Äòfemale‚Äô in the lexicon of petticoat feminism, and thus relieving them of the economic burden of masculinity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Knowing all that, it still basically means that skirts are for women, and women wear skirts to feel like women. Vekllei clothing has thus become multilayered and insulated to adapt to the shift from summer to winter.</p>
<p><strong>As far as colours go</strong>, Vekllei is volcanic and geographically active. Fire and ice are synonymous here. This means that red and blues are associated with keeping warm and ice, and yellows and greens are for the lush foliage in the warmer seasons. It is uncommon to wear reds in the summer  ‚Äî  it‚Äôs too hot to need colours associated with fire.</p>
<p>This post is long enough, I think. Tzipora is in the wind but looks happy enough. If you have questions about the language itself, or what the annotations say, <em>just ask</em>.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/penance.jpg"/> <p><strong>He had sent her a wire some weeks before asking to meet her</strong>. She did not remember him. By now he was an old man, and she, a Gregori baby of sixty four years, had not aged a day. He was close to dying and wanted to relieve his soul of the war crimes he‚Äôd committed as a member of the Vanguard in the Second American Civil War. She had been a little ptitsa back then, fighting with the Milita. He was desperate to repay her, and what she stood for, as in 2127 she is one of the few living Militia women on this Earth.</p>
<p>In this scene we see <strong>Michael Greenfield</strong> washing the feet of <strong>Tzipora Zelda Desmoines</strong> at a spirit shrine in <strong>Vekllei</strong>, in a melding of Christian tradition and Vekllei cultural humility. She is surrounded by her friends, including her estranged Japanese husband on the left (fourteen years old, sixty two years age). She does not like her feet being touched, but it is important to her to see a living artifact of the war that shaped her childhood. She still carries part of the war with her  ‚Äî  as he fills a basin and she bares one foot, Michael notices she is afflicted with nervous tics. She rubs her nose and picks at her shirt. When she is nervous, like she is now, the tics are almost constant.</p>
<p>These two are survivors of the Second American Civil War, which spanned a decade in the 2070s. They fought on opposite sides  ‚Äî  Tzipora on the liberal, socialist, anarchist coalition called the Militia, Michael as a fascist for the Vanguard party. Tzipora grew disillusioned with the war and fled after three years of fighting. Michael continued to serve until the Federal Government succeeded in crushing both movements. The crimes he has committed in war weight on him, now late in life. He passed away six months after this strange and awkward meeting.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/demonattack.jpg"/> <p><em>Blood spirits</em> are unaware people have physical forms. Why should they? No person has entered the realm of the spirits in a millenia.</p>

She was fully in proper kit for a trip to the spirit world  ‚Äî  the lanterns are to keep both her safety among the spirits and to let her blood flow properly respectively, and the orbs around her neck are filled with soil from her homeland to keep her body attached to the spirit world.</p>
<p>While she cannot die in this place, she retains full control of her nervous system, a bone of fact that was proved when the pain of having a hole torn through her hit her brain all at once.</p>
<p>Blood spirits, despite their name, actually take all kinds of fluids from spirits and physical creatures alike. They are easily warded off by other spirits, and are incapable of harming them properly. Should a blood spirit escape into the natural world, however, they would wreak havoc in search for food.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, I have answers. This is a pretty mediocre sketch of an idea I had.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/gregorichildren.jpg"/> <p><strong>This post is part discussion, part lore.</strong></p>
<p>Kojin Karatani, on the subject of childhood, writes;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, children have existed since ancient times, yet &rsquo;the child&rsquo; as we conceive of it and objectify it did not exist prior to a particular period [&hellip;].</p>
<p>From this viewpoint, it becomes clear that the grouping of children by age in the compulsory educational system of modern Japan signified the uprooting of children, as abstract and homogenous entities, from productive relations, social classes, and communities that had previously been their concrete contexts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For my own world (the city-state of Vekllei and her alternate future) this idea is is something I‚Äôm experimenting with. As people <strong>of a modern world, we may contain within ourselves biases about what ‚Äòchildhood‚Äô is.</strong></p>
<p>Karanati‚Äôs fundamental point is that, following the Meiji Restoration in Japan, their education system modernised, and took on the Western idea of a ‚Äòchild‚Äô. Today, the development of children is staggered through very specific age groups  ‚Äî  they play with kids their own age, they learn with kids their own age, and what we expect of them accompanies, in part, how we‚Äôve structured school.</p>
<p>So in my world, I‚Äôve tried to develop a system in which almost all age groups, or at least large groupings of them, learn inside the same classroom. If 25% of rooms in a school are dedicated general-learning classrooms, what could you do with the rest of the space? Dedicated science/language/athletic centres? Likewise, how would children playing with both older and younger kids influence their social development. And how would work (or employment), either in agrarian or industrial contexts, impact their growth as people?</p>
<p>As for lore:</p>
<p>I‚Äôve tried to sketch a uniform here that is both visually interesting and simple enough to assemble (the girl, in this case, is wearing a less-common, formal variation). In keeping with the ideas above, the uniform would be consistent across all year groups.</p>
<p><strong>Things of note on the girl</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Flowers are a large part of femininity, in particular ‚Äògirlishness‚Äô, and elaborate headdresses like the one here are common for picture days and ceremony</li>
<li>She wears a lace apron above her skirt, under the pleat, called a ‚ÄòSoitres Deh‚Äô (soo-treh deh), which is ceremonial and very delicate. Some wear it to announce they‚Äôve entered a relationship. Usually not worn to school.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Things of note on the boy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>His cap, while part of the uniform, is more commonly worn in fields and factories as a labourer‚Äôs cap, and is emblazoned with the emblem of the enterprise or school. Very common in Vekllei.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what to you think? I‚Äôve given enough detail to stop people reading it, but not enough to properly explore the idea of childhood. What do you think? How do you deal with education in your world?</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/worldsritual.jpg"/> <p><strong>Tzipora is the oldest person alive, now aged 1,056 years.</strong> With the body, temperament, and vitality of an 11-year-old, and the lived experience of a dozen generations, she is a victim Gregori syndrome. She has seen man rise from Earth into space, and although she still calls her birth-country of Vekllei on Earth home, she frequently tours the cosmos as part of complex interplanetary diplomacy. The press calls her the Princess of the Earth.</p>
<p>In 3,119 A.D., she visits the Ra system. She meets the people there, called Roala, who were once descendents of East Asia on Earth. Here she takes part in an ancient ritual in which she bridges herself between the spirit and human worlds.</p>
<hr>
<p>She is dressed in both ordinary Vekllei clothing, which is familiar and Earthly, and Roala ceremonial dress patterned with reflective gems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using her left hand, she guides the angle of power.</li>
<li>Her right hand, raised above her head, is the focus of power and is anchored to the human world by her left foot. If she breaks the angle directed by her left hand, and they become unaligned, she will lose her physical space in both worlds and collapse into nothing.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a few minutes at a time, she is able to see and contact both the human and spirit worlds.</p>
<ul>
<li>As she closes the ritual, the power of the stars wane, and so her heart becomes an auxiliary power source to help close the bridge. As it strains under the pressure of joining two worlds, her heart glows through her shirt.</li>
<li>At this moment, plants die under her feet and she mustn‚Äôt be touched, otherwise the bridge will cascade into a wider collapse that can destroy several people.</li>
<li>Finally, her heart settles and Tzipora collapses into the arms of a photographer, dripping with sweat and sapped of all strength.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>It is a great privilege to know how to contact the spirit world. Ordinary Earth people like Tzipora usually have ask for passage from the bones of angels, called Derden. But out here, with the Roala, she partakes in their way of life to cement the bond humanity has across systems.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/anarchist.jpg"/> <p><strong>The young Republican has waited in a queue to have her photo taken in front of the remains of Cherry, Nevada</strong>. Her hair is still short after the fascists shaved her head, and branded her with St David‚Äôs star because she had a Jewish name. She would later tell the Republican Militia that she wasn‚Äôt, in fact, a Jew. The Militia didn‚Äôt care.</p>
<p>So she drapes herself in the anarchist flag and holds an ancient Mosin rifle she‚Äôd never fired, and for a moment she is part of something bigger than herself  ‚Äî  of hope, and anger, and brotherhood. These are the things that fuel the Republican movement, despite its infighting and poor equipment. There are many factions within the Militia  ‚Äî  the Moscow-backed Marxist-Leninists, anarchists, Trotskyists, and smaller liberal sects. For now, they fight together against the fascists.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Vanguard movement grew in the South after decades of poverty and neglect from the federal government</strong>. Vanguardism was ostensibly about family and Southern nobility, but was always unmistakably fascist at its core, and part of a wider populist movement across the world in 2063. Many Southerners found themselves choosing between enlisting with the socialists, or death. Because for many, that‚Äôs what it was. Fascism was death  ‚Äî  if they didn‚Äôt shoot the Jew or the socialist or the negro, they would displace them into oblivion. It was worth picking up a rifle for.</p>
<p>The young girl here, Tzipora, aged eleven, would later be disillusioned by the Republican movement and escape it. She had seen too many terrible things performed on behalf of the Militia, and the anarchists were being sabotaged by Moscow. This was the ultimate product of the civil war  ‚Äî  bitter, jaded soldiers who had been stripped of their idealism and vitality. Fascist or socialist, everything they had fought for had died in the South.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/seaside.jpg"/> <p><strong>About this time of year, in the place between high summer and autumn, the weather is good in Vekllei</strong>. Vekllei is too cold for crickets, but insects are out and the air hums with life  ‚Äî  birds, helijets, and the soft noise an ocean breeze makes as it races toward the harbour, pulling on leaves and skirt hems along the way.</p>
<p>The Lola monorail carries tourists and workers between the district centre and the World Expo Tower. A medihelijet buzzes the top of the hill, circling for a place to land. In the distance a supersonic jet roars off to New York. It‚Äôs a great time to be alive.
Anchored far from the harbour is an enormous nuclear aircraft carrier. From the top of the hill you can see jets jump off and return to the deck like bees in the spring. It‚Äôs training season and the air force cadets are piloting jump-jets.</p>
<p>The days this time of year are almost twenty hours long  ‚Äî  the nightlife is endless and exhausting. In winter Vekllei rests, sleepy, until springtime returns in late May.</p>
<p>The view from Lola is smaller than that of the rest of the city  ‚Äî  the planned city of Vekllei is a few hillsides over, making Lola a wonderful location to raise a family. It feels quiet and small, and the city centre is only ten minutes away by hypertrain.</p>
<p>In this coming late autumn Vekllei will be struck by two nuclear bombs, and although Lola will be spared, the event will radically change life in the sprawling, utopian city of Vekllei.</p>

You can see more of Vekllei <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/74l1yc/a_little_vekllei_general_store/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/75p2nt/watching_the_end_of_the_world/">here</a>. <em>Thanks for reading.</em></p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/princessofearth.jpg"/> <p><strong>Barbaloh was once the spirit of a rainforest</strong>, but now lives only in the world of the spirits as a merchant, selling potions, spells and other supernatural nonsense. <strong>Tzipora</strong>, a brave human girl and fierce humanist, has gained passage to the spirit world through the bones of a derden, or ‚Äúangel‚Äù. She found herself in another dimension and in total darkness, and the spirits immediately sensed her presence, taking physical and anthropomorphic forms to talk to her. A blood spirit, speaking as a deformed rodent creature, took interest in the arteries in her forearms. She would have been killed if not for Barbaloh‚Äôs customers, who drove the spirit off and demanded she meet with Barbaloh. They tell her that she is the first human to enter the spirit world in forty-five thousand years, and since Barbaloh is the defacto lord of the spirit marketplace, he shall listen to what she has to say.</p>
<p>A frog-like spirit called <strong>Woh</strong> tells her to strip off the filthy school uniform she‚Äôd arrived in, and materialises a beautiful gown in front of her. He tells her to wear it, and Tzipora protests, but she begrudgingly undoes the buttons of her shirt and reaches for the gown.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThere,‚Äù Woh tells her in a voice that isn‚Äôt human, ‚Äú<strong>you are now the Princess of the Earth</strong>.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so Tzipora, at least to the spirits, inherited the Earth. Terrified and alone, she became the ambassador of the human race, and to save them she would have to meet Barbaloh.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are obvious elements of spirit culture in the design of the gown. The lanterns suspended from wooden poles give her passage in this place, the left one protecting her body from the spirits and the right one ensuring her blood continues to flow. As a human with a physical form, she is vulnerable to the temperaments of these creatures. Barbaloh asks her to take off her shoes and socks and walk barefoot, to anchor her to the world. Physical beings can become detached from reality down here, forgetting their birth names, forgetting their body and finally starving a state of vegetation. The gown is embedded with crystals of the Earth, sewn out of a material like silk. Circles are a recurring motif, in reference to the Earth.</p>
<p>The story of Tzipora and my retrofuturistic world is a long and occasionally confusing one. It is set in the summer of 2063. If you would like to know more, just ask, or check my post history for everything Vekllei-related. <em>Thanks for listening</em>.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/spies.jpg"/> <p><strong>In Nevada about this time of year, the temperature stays steady at 45 degrees</strong> (~115 in yank). The asphalt sticks to shoes. On the far right is <strong>Lenny the Jew</strong>. The moniker is his own; he‚Äôs a Jew from New York who ended up working for the <strong>Vekllei Rocketry Corps</strong>, the Vekllei espionage agency responsible for operations in the southern United States. Lenny the Jew is good with women, and violence. He operates as a ‚Äúlive‚Äù agent, hunting and eliminating Chinese and American spies when necessary, bringing radicals over the border to cause trouble, and squeezing persons of interest for information. His boss is sitting next to him. <strong>Michael</strong> operates the Vekllei Rocketry Corps, but rarely participates ‚Äúlive‚Äù. His daughter, shipped over from the homeland after the death of her mother, understands the secrecy  ‚Äî  but not the scope  ‚Äî  of what he does. Lenny the Jew has affection for <strong>Tzipora</strong>; she‚Äôs a strange kid that doesn‚Äôt get on well with her peers, so he brings her gifts when he calls by their house.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Vekllei espionage is chaotic</strong>. Very little interest is given towards industrial espionage, unlike the Chinese, who are chasing aerospace and nuclear technology. Vekllei is interested in provoking, destabilising, disrupting, distracting and sabotaging political and economic life in the United States. The Rocketry Corps, despite its name, ferries drugs over the border, commits terrorism and murder, disappears threats, distributes agitprop and pampers people of interest. It is the largest of the localised Vekllei espionage agencies, with little judicial oversight and a nationalistic fervour that makes the Rocketry Corps one of the largest internal threats in the United States today.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/spiritworld.jpg"/> <p><strong>Suddenly the blood drained from her lungs</strong> and she breathed in, only to double over, hacking blood into the grass between her shoes. She wiped her bloody mouth on the back of her arm and mumbled something like ‚Äòsorry‚Äô before coughing again. She slipped off her shoes and made her way to the clearing.</p>
<p>She saw the bones and knelt in front of them, laying some flowers out for it and waiting respectfully. After a few minutes she worked up the nerve to open her mouth, and when she wasn‚Äôt attacked, she began to talk to it in a soft little voice. She said she wanted to go to the spirit world, and it did nothing. She said she needed to go there because she‚Äôd been having dreams about great monsters rising up and destroying humanity. It didn‚Äôt move, and she glanced at the forest spirits that had gathered around her. She clasped her hands together and started to introduce herself to the bones. She was Tzipora, she grew up in the city of Vekllei not far from here, her parents died when she was young and her adoptive mother was struck by a truck and killed last summer. She loves her father and country and doesn‚Äôt want it to be destroyed.</p>
<p>As she talked more she found herself saying aloud things she‚Äôd never said before. About being a Gregori baby, about feeling separated from the rest of the human race, about the time she went to a festival with a Japanese boy who was gone now. She said she liked to write and hadn‚Äôt ever eaten a hotdog but she wanted to, and that once the older girls molested her out the back of the school. She said she liked her hair when it was like this; bouncy and self-regulating. She didn‚Äôt know why it wouldn‚Äôt stay like this all the time, but she didn‚Äôt have a hairbrush, so it was good that it looked good today.</p>
<p>An hour passed and she ran out of things to say and realised her entire life could fit in a conversation on an average bus trip. She unclasped her hands but didn‚Äôt dare shift from her kneel. All of a sudden, the grass beneath her disappeared and she plummeted, shoes, flowers and all, into darkness.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The above passage was written with this picture.</strong> This is the moment that Tzipora, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/6xtflc/tzipora_one_of_the_children_to_stop_ageing_vekllei/">Gregori baby</a> enters the spirit world to stop ancient creatures called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/752bfk/the_face_of_human_extinction/">Lehmenan</a> from destroying the world. The Lehmenan are restless after a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/75p2nt/watching_the_end_of_the_world/">nuclear war between China and the United States</a>. Very few people, and all of them children, know that spirits exist. Alone and terrified of losing the world to the Lehmenan, Tzipora goes to the bones of the Lehmenan‚Äôs creator, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/752bfk/the_face_of_human_extinction/">now-extinct Derden</a>, and asks it to let her into the spirit world.</p>
<p><em>I understand this is quite a lot to take in. Ask me a question, follow the links for more information on the parts of this world, or check my post history if you want more information.</em> I love questions and comments.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/apocolypse.jpg"/> <p><strong>The sight of the missiles nearly made her sick.</strong> Everything around her took on new context. It was such a peaceful afternoon, and the sirens hadn‚Äôt gone off, and here she was, watching the trails the missiles painted in the cloudless sky. And now she was blessed with a newfound psychic ability that told her that everything in this spot would be vapour in a half hour. The wheat, the forest, the road; everything. Anyone who wasn‚Äôt looking at the sky didn‚Äôt know it yet. To folks indoors or out of view of the vapour trails, it was still a beautiful spring. It took a half hour for Vekllei missiles to reach China. Theirs took about the same to get here.</p>
<p>The sirens didn‚Äôt go off until five minutes after the missiles launched. You could tell they were civil defense sirens because they built up to a whine and stayed there, a sound they‚Äôd all heard in drills, but it wasn‚Äôt drill season. Tzipora scrambled down the side of the ditch and took her bike with her, and sat cross-legged in the brook with her hands over her eyes. If everything became bright she‚Äôd hold her breath and lie face down until she was either dead or the sonic boom flung her downstream.</p>
<p>On May 6th 2064 the mid-Atlantic country of <strong>Vekllei</strong>, <strong>China</strong>, and the <strong>United States</strong> participated in a confused nuclear war that nearly annihilated North America and East Asia. In Vekllei, two bombs hit, and the rest of the Chinese delivery aircraft was downed by the air force. The two small-yield ground-burst weapons killed only 20,000. Many millions were saved by the comprehensive civil defense of the country. The United States lost forty million people. China is unknown, but is likely in the hundreds of millions after the full retaliatory strike from two separate countries.</p>
<p>The war had wider consequences, as it awakened ancient creatures underground that were built to protect the Earth. The creatures, called <strong>Lehmenan</strong> in a dead tongue, would in the weeks following the war attempt to wipe the surface of the world clean of human society.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/face.jpg"/> <p>All servants of heaven  ‚Äî  called angels by most people but they belong to a much older name  ‚Äî  are viciously jealous of human beings. In creation, the Earth was promised to them, but the creator God gave the Earth to the human race. In a fit of rage, the angels  ‚Äî  or <strong>Derden</strong>, as they were called before the current chapter of humanity  ‚Äî  buried bioengineered monsters called <strong>Lehmenan</strong> far below the surface of the Earth. If humanity ever became reckless and destroyed themselves, they would awaken and wipe the Earth clean with great lances of fire.</p>
<p>In 2063, <strong>Red China</strong> suffered a military coup d&rsquo;etat, and the ensuing Sino-American nuclear exchange consumed both countries in a great fire that destroyed vast swaths of forest and the creatures and spirits within them. The Lehmenan began to wake.</p>
<p>Tzipora, an unremarkable girl in the small mid-Atlantic country of <strong>Vekllei</strong>, stands in front of the bones of an Angel, or Derden, and begs it to let her into the spirit world to stop the Lehmenan. The Derden hates human beings, and it fills her lungs with blood to try and scare her away. She stands steady.</p>
<p>It was in this moment, in the shadow of fallout in a wind-swept field of rural Vekllei, that a child dressed in the uniform she wore to school became an ambassador for the entire human race. Not before or since has such a remarkable image of humanism in the face of God existed.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/generalstore.jpg"/> <p><strong>In the narrow streets of the Lola district in Vekllei</strong>, artisans and artists hurry about, peddling art and fine goods and attracting the rest of the city to its stores. In Vekllei, there is no currency, so shopping is almost always a pragmatic affair.</p>
<p>Not in Lola. If you‚Äôre in Lola, you‚Äôre there to see the <em>good stuff</em>, produced and sold in little shops like this one. The apartments of this place are small and cramped, and the streets are rarely wide enough for vehicles to pass, but many students dream of moving into the vibrant and colourful district and building lives around their creative passions. Coffee shops here are filled with notebooks and haggard young things, penning their screenplays and worrying about their existential purpose.</p>
<p>Vekllei is a society of restlessly educated people, looking for some greater satisfaction in their lives without the incentives of money. Many serve their country, others fall in love. This shop owner found his. He stocks books, apples, rare foodstuffs and anything that takes his fancy, like an eclectic general store. There are few supermarkets in the country. The demands of the collectivised economy for constant overproduction and total employment results in decentralised distribution like we see here. Tzipora is eleven. She doesn‚Äôt understand all that. But she understands that her mother wants spiced meats for a platter, and Lola is the best place to find seasonal or exotic foods like spiced meat.</p>
<p>Twelve festivals rouse creativity out of the otherwise sleepy Vekllei economy. The <em>festival of feasts</em>, in September, halts regular production and many restaurants switch to exotic foods. During this month, cafes and restaurants are overflowing with people jawing about where they‚Äôve been while cramming their mouths with Oriental, American and South American staples. Following September is October‚Äôs <em>festival of the sea</em>, the climax of which includes the detonation of a nuclear bomb out at sea and a slow, luxurious media worship of the enormous warships that Vekllei operates.</p>
<p>Tzipora ducks under the curtain in the doorway of the store, and wipes her nose on the back of her arm. The bag full of meats is heavy for her. It‚Äôs a long walk back to her apartment building, but on warm autumn evenings like these, that‚Äôs not a bad thing. She waves goodbye and leaves.</p>
<p>If you have questions or comments, I love both. <em>Thanks for listening!</em></p>

<p><strong>The bones of an angel</strong>, either bioengineered in the kilns of an ancient civilisation before ours or fallen from the spirit world, are sacred and insanely jealous of human life. Here, the forgotten bones of an angel try to scare Tzipora by filling her lungs with blood. She knows better ‚Äî she‚Äôs friends with the spirits of this place ‚Äî but the trick still scares her. Many such bones litter the earth, but few are found on the surface.</p>
<p>Ancient creatures that lie dormant below the surface of the world have been disturbed by the nuclear war between China and the U.S. If awakened, the creatures ‚Äî called Lehmenan by forgotten peoples ‚Äî will use lances of fire to cleanse the Earth. In this moment, in a field of flowers in rural Vekllei, eleven-year-old Tzipora acts as an ambassador of the human race, and pleads with the spirit world to forgive the destruction of the North American and East Asian continents.</p>

<p>She has a chronic sadness about her. She feels distinct and separated from the human race, a feeling exacerbated by her Gregori syndrome and a mild obsessive-compulsiveness that makes her feel like a freak. She turns her emotions into words and often falls asleep at her desk, writing a story about a fantasy world she calls Yellowstone.</p>
<p>She is conscious of the world in a way few eleven-year-olds are, and deeply patriotic. Despite her friendlessness, she carries on with good intentions and concern for the future. She bore witness to the atomic bombing of Vekllei in September of 2063.</p>

She offered it a gumdrop and it returned to its natural, translucent form.</p>
<p>Spirits are placed on earth by whatever God watches over the Earth. Tzipora dislikes the God of the world, but she respects the spirits, and as a child she can see them in their natural state. In Vekllei and Scandinavia, they are called Faeries. In Japan, they are spirits. In the United States, there is no word for them, because they are considered to not exist.</p>
<p>Tzipora asked the spirit to watch over her and her father when they are in the desert. From that day on, she left an offering outside in a makeshift shrine in the backyard of their detached midcentury home.</p>
<p>Tzipora has no time for God; she is a zealous humanist at her core. The spirits are fair and good. Because of them, Vekllei is environmentally conscious in a way few other great powers are in 2063.</p>
<p>The written characters are Vekllei, and make a poem;</p>
<p><em>Tzipora is looking for all good things in the world</em></p>
<p><em>The spirits are the mothers and daughters of all good things in the world</em></p>
<p><em>What a beautiful place, crafted in the love between the Earth and children</em></p>
<p>If you have any questions, I like to hear them. If you‚Äôve got illustration tips, I wouldn‚Äôt mind some too ;)</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/fashion.jpg"/> <p><strong>Vekllei kids look to America as a bastion of good taste</strong>; a country of fast cars and diners and sock-hops and high-school romance. Like the Koreans look to Japanese taste, and the British look to the stuff coming out of design houses in France, Vekllei is infatuated with how Americans dress in the year 2063. Like most imported culture in Vekllei, the American teen-age style is misunderstood, butchered, and then transformed into something entirely different as production lines crank out plaid skirts, two-tone shoes and baseball jerseys for Vekllei kids.</p>
<p>Tzipora doesn‚Äôt buy into much of that stuff. She doesn‚Äôt have any friends to show off to, but boy, <em>if she did</em>, they‚Äôd all be jealous of her. While living in Cherry, Nevada, Tzipora experienced American life first-hand. She bought her clothes in American department stores and ate in American diners. Her nose was pulped by American fists after she stayed silent in the American national anthem. Tzipora doesn‚Äôt get on with American kids much  ‚Äî  she doesn‚Äôt get along with a lot of things, it seems. <strong>But gee, what would the kids at her old school in Vekllei say when she turned up in jerseys and trousers?</strong> Wouldn‚Äôt that just be something? They‚Äôd regret making fun of her then.</p>
<p><strong>Left to right:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Trying on an all-wool sack-type dress for the first time. It‚Äôd be pretty if she didn‚Äôt live in a desert.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Vekllei jersey patterned with blossoms, a popular motif. To the American kids, abstract prints on American-style clothes mark her out as a foreigner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Three-quarter-length trousers with white penny loafers. Her T-shirt bears the Vekllei emblem for the moon, but to non-Vekllei it looks Japanese.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pulling her shoes back on after she was dragged around the back of the school and roughed up for ignoring the national anthem. She didn‚Äôt know the words. She knows how to get blood out of a shirt, so it&rsquo;s no biggie. Besides, she got a couple good hits in. If there wasn&rsquo;t five of them, she reckoned she could have fought off Yankee kids.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you‚Äôve got any questions, I love ‚Äòem. Thanks for listening.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/ageing.jpg"/> <p><strong>This is Tzipora.</strong> She is eleven years old, scruffy, and a <strong>Gregori baby</strong>. At the turn of the 21st century, Gregori Hordiyenko, a Ukrainian boy aged nine and a half, stopped aging entirely. By 2063, which is the year Tzipora turned eleven, there are about two hundred Gregori babies in the world, mostly living in secret. Certain religious sects, including Catholics, view Gregori babies as a sign of the Lord‚Äôs action and as a movement towards an approaching religious event. Other religious sects see them simply as angels, eternal beings fallen from heaven.</p>
<p>In reality little is known about the phenomenon. Gregori babies stop growing at the point they‚Äôd usually reach thelarche. Their cells reproduce perfectly, removing the ageing process entirely and making them theoretically immortal. The oldest Gregori baby is fifty-six and lives in Florida. Gregori himself was run down and killed in an accident in his twenties. Gregori babies have no other defining characteristic; they have been found in the Orient and in Africa and in Europe, they have different levels of wellness and many have entirely unremarkable lives.</p>
<p><strong>Tzipora is Vekllei‚Äôs first Gregori baby</strong>, although she was abroad when she was diagnosed. She has not reached menarche and does not appear to have even begun thelarche. Other than her agelessness, she is a normal girl with her own anxieties and joys and relationships. As a child, she has not yet quite understood the magnitude of what has been stripped from her: she will never be able to maintain friends as they age without her, she will never grow up or marry, and assuming she naturally survives, she will watch everyone die before her. As a Gregori baby, she can be killed as any other human being can. The one exception to her condition is cancer and tumour-related diseases, of which she will be immune.
Her father calls her ‚Äúangel‚Äù, and the pet name took on a new meaning as her condition was realised.</p>
<p>Tzipora is religious and believes in a single God and spirits, but dislikes him and blames him for her own situation, shifting her faith into Vekllei and humanity.
Let me know if you have any questions. I love to talk.</p>

	  <title>The Five Uniforms of Any Good Vekllei Girl</title>

	  <![CDATA[These are the five basic outfits a kid in the city of Vekllei rotates between in their life. This is Tzipora. She‚Äôs sharp and a little scruffy. She‚Äôs eleven years old.
The first is her school uniform, complete with embroidered armband featuring the national crest. The skirt has a longer pleated section. She wears penny loafers.
The second is the uniform of the Vekllei Blossoms, equivalent to the Pioneers in the USSR and Red China, or Boy Scouts in the West.]]>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/fiveuniforms.jpg"/> <p>These are the five basic outfits a kid in the city of Vekllei rotates between in their life. This is Tzipora. She‚Äôs sharp and a little scruffy.  She‚Äôs eleven years old.</p>
<p><strong>The first</strong> is her school uniform, complete with embroidered armband featuring the national crest. The skirt has a longer pleated section. She wears penny loafers.</p>
<p><strong>The second</strong> is the uniform of the Vekllei Blossoms, equivalent to the Pioneers in the USSR and Red China, or Boy Scouts in the West. The uniforms are designed around mobility and athleticism, as the focus of these groups has drifted from militarism and centres firmly on nature, building good habits, and instilling the spiritual philosophy of Vekllei in future generations.</p>
<p><strong>The third</strong> is the national dress of Vekllei. It is beautiful, detailed and unique to each girl who wears it. You can find a full-colour picture of this girl in her national dress, with accompanying information, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/6o1k7x/she_stands_in_the_harbour_in_national_dress_jets/">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The fourth</strong> is her casual clothes. Although this is informed by the taste of the girl, this collared shirt and skirt is pretty representative of fashion in 2063. Little flamingos print her white shirt. Flamingos are a popular motif in Vekllei. She holds a magnetic tape reader in her hand that plays music, like ones found in the United States. She can clip it onto the waist of her skirt and do chores while she listens.</p>
<p><strong>The fifth</strong> is a hastily-assembled civil defence volunteer uniform. She is in pyjamas, dressed only in slippers and a long shirt, having awakened seconds before, but she wears the armband with the civil defence logo, a heavy helmet to protect her head and carries a high-beam torch. In the event the sirens go off, she will knock on the doors of neighbouring apartments and guide elderly residents to shelters while older and more experienced folk will tackle more complex duties.</p>
<p>I love to talk and I love questions, so give ‚Äòem to me. Thanks for listening!</p>

	  <![CDATA[Tzipora, a recent immigrant girl of eleven years, wears the feminine national dress of Vekllei. It is a delicate, traditional and deeply spiritual costume, and is tied to Vekllei‚Äôs foundations and aspirations as a state. It has political symbolism, but it also ties the girl to the land she stands on.
Underneath her Lawtsk Ohma (an equivalent phrase might be &ldquo;Maiden‚Äôs Apron, in English, but it loses the emotion of the original phrase; it insinuates youthful innocence and domesticity, industry and love) is a wide lace half-petticoat that sits over her skirt.]]>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/nationaldress.jpg"/> <p>Tzipora, a recent immigrant girl of eleven years, wears the feminine national dress of Vekllei. It is a delicate, traditional and deeply spiritual costume, and is tied to Vekllei‚Äôs foundations and aspirations as a state. It has political symbolism, but it also ties the girl to the land she stands on.</p>
<p>Underneath her Lawtsk Ohma (an equivalent phrase might be &ldquo;Maiden‚Äôs Apron, in English, but it loses the emotion of the original phrase; it insinuates youthful innocence and domesticity, industry and love) is a wide lace half-petticoat that sits over her skirt. These are extraordinarily detailed and extremely delicate. Each one is different and is tailored to the girl who wears it, and usually builds its patterns from the girl‚Äôs birth month and accompanying festival, demeanour and year of her birth. An entire industry exists to produce these lace garments and Vekllei women are traditionally buried with them.</p>
<p>A recurring symbol is a stylised image of the Eliese Orchid, a four-petal flower that naturally grows in Vekllei and represents the seat of power in the city-state and the blood of the citizenry. On her left side she wears the Industry Roundel Star, a common collectivist symbol. Today she wears a black armband on her left arm in mourning, after the atomic bombings of the Lola and Leh Moleneis prefectures, which killed many thousands of her countrymen.</p>
<p>The year is 2063 and the world is unravelling. Tzipora trusts her country. But she worries for it, too; if Europe falls to the Soviets and China seizes Japan, Vekllei won‚Äôt have many friends in the world left.</p>

	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://millmint.net/images/youthmeet.jpg"/> <p>Tzipora is smiling in the photo because she has won the competition for multilingual spelling. She is a recent citizen of <strong>Vekllei</strong>, a postcollectivist country in what we know as Iceland. She beat American boy scouts, Australian girl guides, Chinese and Soviet Pioneers and other youth organisations to win top prize.</p>
<p>The <strong>International Youth Meet</strong> is a games hosted biannually. Tzipora is representing the Vekllei Occupation Zone in Germany with a half-dozen other girls from the O.Z. The games of 2063 are hosted in Bremen, Germany, less than 80 kilometres from the Polish border and the site of a brief nuclear exchange between the U.S. occupation zones and Soviet Poland eight days after this photo was taken.</p>
<p>Tzipora wears the uniform of the <strong>Vekllei Blossoms</strong>, the female youth wing of Vekllei. She is eleven years old. The hammer and sickle pin she wears is not standard issue; it was pulled from a Soviet submariner hat she was given. The international community generally does not trust Vekllei. At the games, in their pastel cardigans, the Vekllei Blossom girls are targets for suspicion and bullying from the rest of the youth groups.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm an Aussie world builder. My world is one stuck in the nuclear age forever. Things are unravelling. Tzipora is worried about the safety of her parents and the future of the world. I haven‚Äôt posted before, so if you‚Äôre interested, ask me anything!</p>
