This article appeared in Issue #6 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.    Pictured above: various fashions worn by Vekllei women, showcasing heavy cold-weather dresses, simple styling, strong geometric shapes and colours, loose fits, and modest hemlines.
  Pictured below: postmodern neomarxism, which Iâ€™ve tricked you into reading with anime.

This article appeared in Issue #6 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.   For a brief period of time, Zelda and Cobian took it upon themselves to make something of their youth. Cobian fancied herself a gymnast, and though this ambition arrived too late and left too soon, she was quite good at it for a while.</description>

It was like Christ himself had blessed them. It only (barely) seat five, and there were six of them, but it wasnâ€™t a problem.</description>

This article appeared in Issue #5 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.   In Vekllei, uniforms are prevalent across all levels of society. They are perhaps the most obvious example of the opaque contradictions at the heart of Vekllei life, caught between wholly opposing ideas: between tradition and progress; liberty and control; and, most crucially here â€” between individualism and the burden of society.</description>

The puffin scouts set up camp not far from the rest, just outside of Krafla in the Lava region. When they moved south tomorrow, thick native grasses and trees would give way to flower-tundras and bare hills, and by Tuesday theyâ€™d be in the heart of Lava â€” empty and extraterrestrial and volcanic.</description>

This article appeared in Issue #2 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.   Atlantic Salmon was the best in the world, and Vekllei had a lot of it. Ocean-going fishing boats brought their haul to Ro, where they cruised wide postwar canals and unloaded tonnes of shiny, bright salmon into processing plants. If a new factory was built, so too was a canal or a railroad.</description>

And that was that â€” there would be no school in the morning. That was how it worked in rural Vekllei, a million miles from the automatic trains on endless timetables.</description>

This article appeared in Issue #1 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.   When I paint Vekllei, I usually depict the warmer months. Hems are shorter, days are longer, and the destabilisation of the worldâ€™s climate has only benefited these arctic people. At the gift end of the Vekllei low pressure system, Scandinavian misery has become Mediterranean pleasure, with warm summers and a mild Autumn and Spring.</description>

Her medical problems; her violent childhood; her sensitivity and melancholy â€” you could feel sorry for her, because a lot of her problems were not her fault. She invoked sympathy.
Tzipora never considered herself particularly tragic.</description>

The CafÃ© Resmoiones approaches its hundredth birthday as the girls outside await their fifteenth. The building was once a kindergarten, so theyâ€™d been told, but through decades of Veklleiâ€™s irreverent planning it had become a cafÃ©. It was not a very good cafÃ©, the food was shit, but the building was nice and it was at the bottom of Lolaâ€™s steep residential hill.</description>
