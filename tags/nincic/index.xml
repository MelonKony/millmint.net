	  <![CDATA[Tzipora just wants the god damn answer to her question. Tzipora&rsquo;s homeroom teacher uses her as an excuse to talk to the cute chemistry teacher.
Tzipora&rsquo;s teacher is Mr Kowalczyk. Despite her expression above, they get along well. His appearance is based off drummer Steve Gadd.
Her chemistry teacher is Ms Zora Ninčić, charming eligible bachelorette and longtime crush of Kowalczyk. Her appearance is based off the teller who sold me a bus ticket in Dubrovnik.]]>

	  <![CDATA[From left: Ms Ninčić, Tzipora, Mr Kowalczyk. On the left is Ms Zora Ninčić, and on the right Mr Kowalczyk. Students joke that they must be brother and sister because they look similar, but they&rsquo;re unrelated. Ms Ninčić teaches social sciences, and Mr Kowalczyk teaches chemistry.
Tzipora is a somewhat poor student, but she is well-loved by these teachers, and they go above and beyond in helping Tzipora muster the grades she&rsquo;ll need to go on to university.]]>

<p>On the left is Ms Zora Ninčić, and on the right Mr Kowalczyk. Students joke that they must be brother and sister because they look similar, but they&rsquo;re unrelated. Ms Ninčić teaches social sciences, and Mr Kowalczyk teaches chemistry.</p>
<p>Tzipora is a somewhat poor student, but she is well-loved by these teachers, and they go above and beyond in helping Tzipora muster the grades she&rsquo;ll need to go on to university. She is very grateful to them.</p>
<p>There are rumours Mr Kowalczyk has a crush on Ms Ninčić.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I based Kowalczyk off Steve Gadd, my favourite session drummer of all time, and Ninčić off a woman who sold me a bus ticket in croatia, who had this wild curly hair afro but looked Slavic.
It&rsquo;s also an example of teachers wearing similar uniforms (in their case, more of a dress code) to students.</p>
