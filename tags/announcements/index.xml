      <description>Hello everyone. Just a little update.
As a way of thanking my Patrons, Iâ€™m taking some time over the next two weeks or so to create a little set of Tzipora postcards and send them out as gifts.
How many cards will the set contain?
 Iâ€™m aiming for about six cards.
 How much money would you need to have forked over to get some?
 I think about $20 over your pledge lifetime would cover print and shipping, though Iâ€™ll let you know if that goes up or down.</description>
