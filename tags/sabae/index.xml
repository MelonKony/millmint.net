	  <![CDATA[Going out for drinks after work. This character belongs to a Japanese artist and train enthusiast I follow on Twitter. Something about her appearance and oversized glasses were really funny to me, so I decided to draw her.

<p>This character belongs to a Japanese artist and train enthusiast I follow on Twitter. Something about her appearance and oversized glasses were really funny to me, so I decided to draw her. This must have been out of left field for him, since I&rsquo;d never interacted with him before, but he really liked it!</p>
<p>Her name is Sabae-chan, and was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/unagiPost">@unagiPost</a>. &ldquo;Sabae&rdquo; is a city in Japan famous for manufacturing, well, glasses.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/unagiPost">@unagiPost</a> liked my drawing:</p>

<p>His followers reacted with amusement that someone from Australia was drawing his characters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re an international cultured person!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This character is more popular with overseas followers than in Japan, so I would like to consider adding English without joking.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have to study English! &lsquo;Lady Sabae.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
