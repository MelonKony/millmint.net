They are perhaps the most obvious example of the opaque contradictions at the heart of Vekllei life, caught between wholly opposing ideas: between tradition and progress; liberty and control; and, most crucially here â€” between individualism and the burden of society.</description>

This article appeared in Issue #3 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.There are two regular police organs in Vekllei.
 Fedecenoayan porits (national police, or venopor) Comoisniyan denporitsa (local police, or cosmopor)  A young venopor officer stands on the left, in the full street regalia theyâ€™re renowned for. Unlike cosmopor, they often carry machine guns while on patrol and are stationed outside of government buildings, hospitals, train stations, ports, schools and any company managed directly by a bureau, which is a trade organ of national importance.</description>

This article appeared in Issue #1 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.When I paint Vekllei, I usually depict the warmer months. Hems are shorter, days are longer, and the destabilisation of the worldâ€™s climate has only benefited these arctic people. At the gift end of the Vekllei low pressure system, Scandinavian misery has become Mediterranean pleasure, with warm summers and a mild Autumn and Spring.</description>
