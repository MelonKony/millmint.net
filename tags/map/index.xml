      <description>On the morning of the second day, I watched a fly crawl across the cheek of the middle-aged woman, probably an office worker, lying next to me.

 The largest division of any portion of Vekllei land is the borough; a region of varying size and population with common culture, food dependency and economic interest. Anything larger than that is simply Vekllei ‚Äî they are ‚Äúone city‚Äù, after all, and consider themselves a city-state.</description>
