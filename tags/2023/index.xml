	  <description> Vekllei has a cultural tradition of medallions and pins, which make up a lot of the jewellery in a moneyless society. </description>

	  <description>Despite having many consumer products, Vekllei is not a consumer society and is not equipped to succeed as one. Benevolent state monopolies produce staple goods &amp;ndash; food, clothing, and shelter &amp;ndash; and everything else is left up to the anarchic participatory industriousness of its people, which is situated somewhere between a productive free market and chaos.
These planned production mechanisms facilitate the reliable overproduction of essential goods that meet the needs of Vekllei population.</description>

	  <title>The Prime Minister(s)</title>

	  <description>Vekllei is a nonpartisan democracy with two, equal heads of state &amp;ndash; one man and one woman. Known as Crown Ministers in Vekllei, they generally acknowledge the title of Prime Minister overseas, as the head of Vekllei government and secretary-general of the Vekllei Cabinet. The position is a quirk of the postwar period, when radical alternatives to existing systems of government were being explored in the anarcho-feminist whirlwind of independence.</description>
