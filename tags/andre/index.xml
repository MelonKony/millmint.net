	 	<![CDATA[<img src="https://images.millmint.net/rumba.jpg"/> <p><strong>Coretti Adoula was a good singer but didn’t sing much</strong>. Tzipora had regarded her politely but distantly for a while after Moise started dating her in 10th grade. It was an awkward thing. Tzipora was not quite sure how to strike up a conversation — maybe she was a little insecure.</p>
<p>Coretti was an Afro-Russian, but had lived in Vekllei since she was six. She spoke without an accent and was well-accustomed to life in Vekllei. Tzipora had been born in Vekllei, but here she stood, short and stupid with the clumsy, childish accent of a foreigner. She was very self-conscious about her foreignness.</p>
<p>There was also a contest of appearances. Moise was Tzipora’s first male friend, and so she paid attention to who he liked. Coretti was tall, sweet-natured, pretty and had dark skin of the kind Tzipora hadn’t seen before. Every time she saw Coretti, Tzipora was suddenly aware of how short, bad-mannered and pale she was. In some ways, they were opposed in his orbit, competing for Moise’s time and affection as satellites.</p>
<p>About the time Moise and Coretti started dating, Tzipora was spending a lot of time in clubs, immersing herself in the Lola jazz scene. It was a fantastic time to be in it — Lola is a neighbourhood of migrants, and you had all the sounds of the world ringing out across the borough. Tzipora loved jazz — she liked any kind of interesting, syncopated and percussive music — and Coretti’s brother was the drummer in a Congolese rumba band called <em>Rats de Brazzaville</em>. His name was Andre. Tzipora knew him well. <em>Rats de Brazzaville</em> were a big band with a big sound, which made them a big deal for dance clubs. She had probably seen them play a dozen times.</p>
<p>Talk about a small world. When Coretti brought it up, the usually quiet Tzipora looked up — <em>Andre Adoula? From the Brazzaville Rats? How do you know him?</em> All it took was that coincidence and a love of rumba, and all of Tzipora’s misgivings about Coretti were forgotten. Why should she sit here and pity herself? It feels better to dance, doesn’t it?</p>
