      <description>Archived from the original article here    NO REALTORS EXCEPT THE STATE â–  THE COUNTY THE AGENT OF THE STATE â–  THE ARCHITECT THE AGENT OF THE COUNTY
 It is clear that in Vekllei democracy is a way of living more than it is a form of government. After all, by metrics of representation, the Atlantic nation&amp;rsquo;s electoral system often sputters and fails, undermined by the bundling of the human and natural votes as equal, and the wildly disproportionate borough system.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here   In Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s vast interior, there are large areas of uninhabited land designated as off-limits terra nullius. This is kronaismioudelfia, or &amp;ldquo;crown land,&amp;rdquo; named for the Upen&amp;rsquo;s perception of all living creatures as god-kings rather than Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s historical monarchy.
It is very important to make a distinction between the modern nation-state and Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s preconception of itself.
This is a forced pacifism hoisted upon themselves, a disciplined fear integral to the deeper psychospiritual intuition within Upen.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here   For all you&amp;rsquo;ve seen of Vekllei and her characters, you&amp;rsquo;ve never heard a single one of them speak. This post marks a little exploration into the Vekllei language, and a &amp;lsquo;soft launch&amp;rsquo; of my website, https://millmint.net. The proper launch will come at the end of the month.
This post will briefly discuss some elements shown in this infographic, but a large article on the language has been drafted here.</description>

This article appeared in Issue #3 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.   Unique among girls #  There are a lot of things Tzipora does differently to everybody else, and they start to make a lot more sense when you realise Tzipora either does not realise she is unusual, or does not care.</description>
