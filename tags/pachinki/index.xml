This article predates the project, and should be considered non-canon.The Palace Gods live in decadence in an isolated and incestuous land above the mortal planes called the Palace.

In places where the soil is too thin for heavy wheats, sparrowgrass is grown. This grass has large heads that can be eaten raw and taste citrusy and acidic as they only grow in toxic soils.</description>
