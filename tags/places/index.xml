      <description>A shining beacon in the dull, uniform and largely artificial world
&amp;ndash; Olegas Truchanas (1923-1972)
 These are the rangelands. This is what they look like. To most of us it&amp;rsquo;s known as the Outback. These photos were taken two years ago, during July 2017. Australia is very, very big. It also does not have many people living in it. We have less than a tenth of the population of the United States, but are roughly equivalent in our land area.</description>

      <description>A shining beacon in the dull, uniform and largely artificial world
&amp;ndash; Olegas Truchanas (1923-1972)
 These photos were taken across two trips to the West Coast of Tasmania. The first was in September 2020. The second was in April 2021. Each time it took about four or five hours to get there, driving along the only road that cuts through the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. It includes about a fifth of Tasmania&amp;rsquo;s landmass, covering almost all of the southwest.</description>
