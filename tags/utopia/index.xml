	  <description>߷ This article is about Hobart&amp;rsquo;s characters, who live in Vekllei  Although almost all characters in this project were born in Vekllei, they are of vastly different heritages and backgrounds. A study of modern Vekllei is a study of immigration. Most characters here have swirling ethnic, religious and cultural histories aiding and obscuring their destinies. This is useful, because if you&amp;rsquo;re following along with this project, you&amp;rsquo;re in some small way an immigrant yourself.</description>

	  <description>This is the Epoch of Rest #  ❖ Check out the FAQ  These stories are about good places and people. They take place in a fictional state called Vekllei, which is an Atlantic country that does not use money. The point of this project is to take the purity of that idea seriously, and immerse a place of wonder in the real world.
 So this is Utopia,</description>
