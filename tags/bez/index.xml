	  <![CDATA[✿ This image was a gift to my friend Bez. Thank you Bez. Occasionally I&rsquo;ll join an &ldquo;art trade&rdquo; to change things up and break the repetition of working in one universe with one set of characters. Bez is a friend of mine and a talented artist, and so for Christmas we decided to produce secret works involving characters and places we don&rsquo;t usually draw. There&rsquo;s nothing more exciting as an artist than seeing through new eyes &ndash; that&rsquo;s the magic of having someone illustrate your people and places.]]>

<p><strong>Occasionally I&rsquo;ll join an &ldquo;art trade&rdquo;</strong> to change things up and break the repetition of working in one universe with one set of characters. Bez is a friend of mine and a talented artist, and so for Christmas we decided to produce secret works involving characters and places we don&rsquo;t usually draw. There&rsquo;s nothing more exciting as an artist than seeing through new eyes &ndash; that&rsquo;s the magic of having someone illustrate your people and places.</p>
<p>My piece, finished today three days after Christmas, depicts the Vekllei crew encountering Valin and her aphis, a sort of canine-feline hybrid creature. The setting is based on photographs I took of where I grew up, amidst temperate rainforest on my property. Bez&rsquo;s contribution is below. I love it.</p>

<p>I like the attention to detail on Tzipora and the golden wattle on the right. Vekllei has wattle as canon &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t make much sense, but who cares? It&rsquo;s too lovely to exclude from utopia. Bez also shared a preliminary sketch with me, seen below.</p>

<p>Thank you Bez &ndash; let&rsquo;s do it again sometime!</p>

<p><strong>Fruit Tingles</strong> (<em>Fodsa Spas</em>) are a chalky sweet popular in Vekllei. They fizz in your mouth and come in several flavours. They&rsquo;re as popular today as they were a hundred and fifty years ago when they were first produced by Montre Confectionary in 1936.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re exported and enjoyed all over the commonwealth, from Kala to Kalina.</p>
<p>Clockwise: <strong>Hen</strong>, from Kus (Kala), <strong>Bez</strong>, from Demon, <strong>Tzipora</strong>, from Seispri (Vekllei) and <strong>Sydney</strong>, from Montesur (Kalina).</p>
