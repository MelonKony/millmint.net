	  <description>❖ This image was a gift to my friend Bez. Thank you Bez.  Occasionally I&amp;rsquo;ll join an &amp;ldquo;art trade&amp;rdquo; to change things up and break the repetition of working in one universe with one set of characters. Bez is a friend of mine and a talented artist, and so for Christmas we decided to produce secret works involving characters and places we don&amp;rsquo;t usually draw. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing more exciting as an artist than seeing through new eyes &amp;ndash; that&amp;rsquo;s the magic of having someone illustrate your people and places.</description>

	  <description>❖ This image is a website-exclusive sketch produced as a masthead for the November Patreon update. The typeface in this image is a preview version &amp;ldquo;Nay Aug&amp;rdquo; by Alex Tomlinson, who you can follow here.  Fruit Tingles (Fodsa Spas) are a chalky sweet popular in Vekllei. They fizz in your mouth and come in several flavours. They&amp;rsquo;re as popular today as they were a hundred and fifty years ago when they were first produced by Montre Confectionary in 1936.</description>
