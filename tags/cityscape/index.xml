      <description>For a brief period of time, Zelda and Cobian took it upon themselves to make something of their youth. Cobian fancied herself a gymnast, and though this ambition arrived too late and left too soon, she was quite good at it for a while. Tzipora was better suited on the trampoline, where her stiff leg didnâ€™t give her as much trouble.
They trained for about two hours, and after practice they met up to travel home together.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article hereðŸŒ¼ Featured in the Atlantic
This article appeared in Issue #5 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.Another paint-sketch â€” a painting done fast. Iâ€™m trying to learn to a) paint and b) paint on an industrial scale.
Sheâ€™d missed the fast tram, caught a tiny splinter in her thumb, lost a button and now the match wouldnâ€™t strike.</description>

      <description>Atlantic Salmon was the best in the world, and Vekllei had a lot of it. Ocean-going fishing boats brought their haul to Ro, where they cruised wide postwar canals and unloaded tonnes of shiny, bright salmon into processing plants. If a new factory was built, so too was a canal or a railroad. Nothing was trucked. Fish was traded fresh in markets or turned into emulsifiers and fertiliser.
The canals were worked heavily, and few fishing vessels were incorporated.</description>

      <description>In an unprecedented event, during Veklleiâ€™s 50th Sea Festival since Independence in 2065, an 8 kiloton fission bomb was sunk to a depth of 150 meters and detonated at midday. It was an incredible sight on a day so clear you could see the gentle curve of the earth where it met the horizon. A flash of light and a spray dome surged outwards into the quiet Atlantic, which was broken apart by plumes that formed a column of water that climbed high into the sky.</description>

      <description>Tzipora had been ejected from the operations room once the guys arrived. She knew what was going down, anyway. No specifics. But you didnâ€™t bring in uniformed soldiers for regular business. National Intelligence liked to work with their own people.
Five days prior, Baron hailed an EB/NI company car and it pulled up beside him. The electric passenger window slid down. Baron nodded at the passenger.
â€œEverythingâ€™s in here. Thereâ€™s more if you need it.</description>
