His obscurity is part of a severe disposition, made obvious by his astonishing disinterest in friends and hobbies.</description>

This article appeared in Issue #5 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.   It&amp;rsquo;s been a week since I&amp;rsquo;ve posted. Most of that was spent drawing the same thing over and over.
A painting? Please. That&amp;rsquo;s a day&amp;rsquo;s work â€” maybe two. A five second loop of Tzipora jumping in and shuffling over? A week.</description>

This article appeared in Issue #2 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.   What is Vekllei?
Hi, Iâ€™m Hobart and I write and draw Vekllei at Studio MillMint.
This is a pretty complex project. Not just complex insofar as thereâ€™s a lot to read about it, but that it uses concepts and terminology you might not be familiar with if this is your first time around utopian fiction.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Vekllei is a country in my alt-world; a utopian fever dream of googie aesthetics, participatory economics and nostalgia.
Welcome to the â€˜Petticoat Projectâ€™, a collection of stories about a country and a girl.Â The concept is broken down into three sections:
 Author:Â for blog posts and articles on the Petticoat Project, utopian fiction, personal news item, etc. Character:Â for posts about Tzipora, people in her life, or otherwise events that occur during her time on Earth.</description>
