      <description>In summer, the sun is up all night. She wakes at five and spends the mornings by herself, reading the paper or a paperback. Baron works late ‚Äî he wakes late. They have breakfast together, so until then she drinks coffee out of a packet and starts the fire if it‚Äôs cold. You were supposed to save power, but sometimes she ran her electric blanket all night, which kept her snug until the under-floor heating warmed up.</description>

      <description>The Venopor (Fedecenoayan porits, lit. Police of the Parliament) are Vekllei‚Äôs special police branch. They occupy a function somewhere between special policing and the paramilitary, linking Vekllei‚Äôs treasured infrastructure with its civilian police (‚ÄúCosmopor‚Äù), armed forces, and shadowy intelligence networks. Though they fulfil police functions today, their history is with the Royal Guards and Federal Police of yesteryear, which in turn has produced unusual units like the Gold Sappers, which are unique in modern policing.</description>

      <description>A woman has so many parts to her body, life is very hard indeed.
 ‚Äî Lu Xun, 1927
 Even from my point of view, as a woman, there is nothing attractive about such &amp;lsquo;backward elements.&amp;rsquo; Their skin is beginning to wrinkle, their hair is growing thin, and fatigue is robbing them of their last traces of attractiveness.
 ‚Äî Ding Ling on the long-marcher woman soldiers, 1942</description>

      <description>Out in Voya Voya, the gardens light the people, and distill human temperament into momentary, sequential lyrical images. A dead leaf moving by miracle across still water; an overturned bucket collecting dew along its handle; fern leaves half-curled, young and growing. Vekllei is known as a ‚Äúgarden city,‚Äù and Voya Voya has the best of them. Vekllei urban planning is wandering and wasteful, and in this borough the city centre is checkered by wild parks filled with silence and rainforest smells.</description>

      <description>Tzipora is a sand mage.
Actually, she isn‚Äôt, but I wanted to draw something with particles and ended up doing different paint sketches for a few hours. This was the best one, and also the most stupid.
Canonically, Tzipora can‚Äôt swim, so she spends more time on the beach than in the water. The colour of the sand here suggests it‚Äôs an artificial ‚Äúwhite beach‚Äù in Mumen or nearby. Most beaches in Vekllei are black.</description>

      <description>üå∫ This article was part of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Ocean Month in March 2021  In Eyri, the bones of an ancient beast warp and groan in the sun, red skin glinting in the whitecap churn of the shallows, oxidising, broken, ripped open by the sea. Everyone in the North of Vekllei knows about it. Mysteries abound. Even in our atomic century, the humans of Vekllei are enamoured with and terrified by the ocean.</description>

      <description>üå∫ This article was part of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Ocean Month in March 2021  Welcome again to Ocean Month. If you have questions, just ask.
When we say ‚ÄúVekllei,‚Äù we most often think of the Home Island, the city-state to which the country owes its name. In practice, however, the state of Vekllei is portioned between many far-flung corners of the Atlantic Ocean. From tropical jungles and dry wine-making country to mossy woodlands and arctic deserts, ‚ÄúVekllei‚Äù as a singular concept is obfuscated by its diversity of land and people, and better represents a coalition of disparate Atlantic states than a single, centralised city-state.</description>

      <description>üå∫ This article was part of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Ocean Month in March 2021  üå∫ Note from the Editor
Although vessels described here are written with female pronouns as per Western convention, Vekllei traditionally uses male pronouns for navy vessels.  Nuclear Heavy Battlecruiser V.V. Lava is the first of the Lava-class cruisers, the largest of Vekllei‚Äôs surface warships. Vekllei doctrine does not typically float cruisers with fleets, and so the Lava often operates independently, outfitted for a variety of roles.</description>

      <description>Lin Zhi was nuts. She was lovely, but she was nuts. Tzipora followed along, pleading occasionally, a squeaking voice of concern. The cricket bat dragged and bounced along the poor road sealing.
‚ÄúYou could go to prison,‚Äù Tzipora said, protesting weakly. ‚ÄúWhy not send Moise and his boys? They‚Äôll put the fear of God in him.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis is stupid,‚Äù Zhi said in clumsy Vekllei, staring ahead. ‚ÄúYou do not know what it‚Äôs like.</description>

      <description>üå∫ This article was part of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Mail Week in February 2021  Caught amidst sunrays in early Autumn, things are good. You could call almost anyone on the telephone these days. And if you wanted to see someone, why travel? A videophone was just as good. But just as the photograph failed to displace the painter, neither did the telephone or videophone succeed in killing the hand-written letter. There was something thoughtful about it.</description>

      <description>His hand was hurting bad, but no one asked him about it the day after. Moise always had a temper, and now he had a reputation. He got no words of sympathy from the other seniors of Lola 8th School.
Considering his bluntness and irritability, it was funny that he could only make good friends with women. His father was a bastard and his mother was in Greece, so his sister took their place.</description>

      <description>üå∫ This article was part of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Mail Week in February 2021  We‚Äôre going to do a deep dive on stamps today.
You can tell a domestic Vekllei stamp from its international counterpart quite easily:
 Domestic stamps have a coloured square, called a chromacode, used for sorting mail automatically within the country by a special machine called a kinosemimatia. Domestic stamps do not show a price in Vekllei Kroner, and generally do not use the Vekllei hieroglyph to announce its origin.</description>

      <description>üå∫ This article was part of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Mail Week in February 2021  The Stamp Manufacturie of the Royal Mail Press, located on 5th Avenue, churns millions of stamps a year out of its massive drum presses. Stamps are used on mail instead of postcodes, and as payment for the international and courier work the Royal Mail does abroad. Since Vekllei does not use money domestically, Vekllei people do not pay for postage and stamps are used in the automatic sorting system to determine the destination for any Vekllei territory, including its arctic, peripheral and antarctic possessions.</description>

      <description>Hello,
I‚Äôm Hobart, and I‚Äôm the creator of this place. I‚Äôve been drawing Vekllei for a few years now, and I love doing it.
To celebrate 3,000 members, use this as a cosy thread/AMA to settle in, and have any questions you might have about the project answered.
For those who are new, I encourage you to read the posts pinned to the top of the subreddit for a crash course in what‚Äôs going on here.</description>

      <description>üå∫ This article was part of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Mail Week in February 2021  It was the hottest day of June so far, in that time of year where the sun never set on Vekllei. It was the first week of sleepless nights; the windows thrown open, air sticky and pungent with the smells of the rainforests, tossing and turning in the heat.
A stab of panic shot through her as she woke, bleary-eyed and senseless, to the quiet bedside clock.</description>

      <description>üå∫ This article was part of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Mail Week in February 2021  The M.S. Fairie Model 54-2 ‚ÄúMail Hopper‚Äù is a strange aircraft. The basic design has remained unchanged for over a hundred years, imported from the United States way back during the massive scrapping of junk warplanes after the Second World War. Even back during the Junta years the country had little respect for foreign intellectual property, and by 1949 had started rolling out Imitation Catalinas, which were among the first indigenous aircraft in the country.</description>

      <description>üå∫ This article was part of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Mail Week in February 2021  Here we have arranged the highest-ranking and lowest-ranking members of the Royal Vekllei Mail (Mail A.r.). On the left is an Office Postgirl, a precursory position tasked with distributing letters in the sprawling bureau complexes abundant in the centralised postwar period. This particular employee is Aleja Hern√°ndez, who has decided she‚Äôd rather deliver mail than spend another year studying for high school exit exams.</description>

      <description>üå∫ This article was part of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Mail Week in February 2021  There are not many postal services older than the Royal Vekllei Mail. It is so old that in the Vekllei language its title is simply ‚ÄòMail‚Äô ‚Äî the ‚ÄòRoyal‚Äô and ‚ÄòVekllei‚Äô are implied by the use of its hieroglyph. Founded in 1422 as part of the military communications system between government and mercantile government holdings, it has survived various restructurings ‚Äî and several wars ‚Äî to remain a critical communications and cultural institution today.</description>

      <description>She joined the Puffin Scouts to make friends. Tzipora was not especially rugged or outdoorsy, but she was a fresh patriot, and the idea of collecting awards for conservation, in her mind, was much like Baron collecting medals for killing reds in the War.
The green and gold of the Puffin Scouts represent nature and living blood respectively. Entwined, as here on her scarf, they mean the chaos and inhumanity of nature in Vekllei Semaphore.</description>

      <description>Lava was a modern walled city. It had long lost its walls, but its florid green belt disguised a complex network of trenches, tunnels and forts that linked emplacements in the surrounding mountains. Together, these systems would ensure Vekllei would never again have to tolerate occupation by a foreign power. Lava was on the outskirts of Vekllei‚Äôs great capital city, and much of its cityscape was dispersed, affording residents a slower pace of life.</description>

      <guid>https://millmint.net/posts/2021-01-11-automen/</guid>
      <description>The Vekllei word for a robot is automasiosn, or ‚Äòautoman‚Äô. When we talk about Vekllei being a ‚Äúpost-scarcity society,‚Äù it is by automen through which it happens. They are found across the entire country in all types of hard and boring work, forever dutiful, forever mindless. It is not that the robot has replaced the human worker, since about 90% of Vekllei people are employed. Instead, the automan takes its place in the necessary evils of industrial society, fulfilling the wildest fantasies of utopian industrialists; the factory is no longer just the place of the machine, it is in fact a machine itself.</description>

      <description>The New Year in Vekllei rings out during its months of darkness and cold. This calendar runs the regular affairs of the country, like it does the modern world. To Vekllei people, however, it is plain that New Years occurs not in darkness but instead in the summer solstice in June, the way it has for thousands of years in the dramatic cycles of light and dark in the country. In this sense, the end of December resonates among businesses and little else, much like the financial year elsewhere.</description>
