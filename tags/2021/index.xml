      <description>🌺 This article was part of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Ocean Month in March 2021   Editors Note: Although vessels described here are written with female pronouns as per Western convention, Vekllei traditionally uses male pronouns for navy vessels.
 Nuclear Heavy Battlecruiser V.V. Lava is the first of the Lava-class cruisers, the largest of Vekllei’s surface warships. Vekllei doctrine does not typically float cruisers with fleets, and so the Lava often operates independently, outfitted for a variety of roles.</description>

      <description>Lin Zhi was nuts. She was lovely, but she was nuts. Tzipora followed along, pleading occasionally, a squeaking voice of concern. The cricket bat dragged and bounced along the poor road sealing.
“You could go to prison,” Tzipora said, protesting weakly. “Why not send Moise and his boys? They’ll put the fear of God in him.”
“This is stupid,” Zhi said in clumsy Vekllei, staring ahead. “You do not know what it’s like.</description>

      <description>🌺 This article was part of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Mail Week in February 2021   This marks the end of our close-up of the mail in Vekllei. As voted by my patrons, next month is Ocean Month, which will be a lot of fun. Stay tuned.
After each themed month, a new article stuffed full of original content goes up on the wiki. The first one, of course, is about post in Vekllei.</description>

      <description>His hand was hurting bad, but no one asked him about it the day after. Moise always had a temper, and now he had a reputation. He got no words of sympathy from the other seniors of Lola 8th School.
Considering his bluntness and irritability, it was funny that he could only make good friends with women. His father was a bastard and his mother was in Greece, so his sister took their place.</description>

      <description>🌺 This article was part of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Mail Week in February 2021  We’re going to do a deep dive on stamps today.
You can tell a domestic Vekllei stamp from its international counterpart quite easily:
 Domestic stamps have a coloured square, called a chromacode, used for sorting mail automatically within the country by a special machine called a kinosemimatia. Domestic stamps do not show a price in Vekllei Kroner, and generally do not use the Vekllei hieroglyph to announce its origin.</description>

      <description>🌺 This article was part of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Mail Week in February 2021   Mail Week has turned into more of a “Mail Fortnight,” but that’s just how it goes sometimes. This is the 5th drawing in the Mail Week series, where we look at post and people in Vekllei.
 The Stamp Manufacturie of the Royal Mail Press, located on 5th Avenue, churns millions of stamps a year out of its massive drum presses.</description>

      <description>🌺 This article was part of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Mail Week in February 2021  It was the hottest day of June so far, in that time of year where the sun never set on Vekllei. It was the first week of sleepless nights; the windows thrown open, air sticky and pungent with the smells of the rainforests, tossing and turning in the heat.
A stab of panic shot through her as she woke, bleary-eyed and senseless, to the quiet bedside clock.</description>

      <description>🌺 This article was part of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Mail Week in February 2021  The M.S. Fairie Model 54-2 “Mail Hopper” is a strange aircraft. The basic design has remained unchanged for over a hundred years, imported from the United States way back during the massive scrapping of junk warplanes after the Second World War. Even back during the Junta years the country had little respect for foreign intellectual property, and by 1949 had started rolling out Imitation Catalinas, which were among the first indigenous aircraft in the country.</description>

      <description>🌺 This article was part of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Mail Week in February 2021   I wasn’t really planning on spending a week working my way through Vekllei’s postal service, but then again — why not? In the coming days we’ll see stamps, mail trains and all manner of transport systems. Maybe we’ll cap it with a look at the Royal Mail HQ. Then next week we’ll look at something else.</description>

      <title>The Men and Women of the Royal Mail in Vekllei</title>
      <link>https://millmint.net/posts/2021-02-01-mail/</link>

      <guid>https://millmint.net/posts/2021-02-01-mail/</guid>
      <description>🌺 This article was part of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s Mail Week in February 2021  There are not many postal services older than the Royal Vekllei Mail. It is so old that in the Vekllei language its title is simply ‘Mail’ — the ‘Royal’ and ‘Vekllei’ are implied by the use of its hieroglyph. Founded in 1422 as part of the military communications system between government and mercantile government holdings, it has survived various restructurings — and several wars — to remain a critical communications and cultural institution today.</description>

      <description>She joined the Puffin Scouts to make friends. Tzipora was not especially rugged or outdoorsy, but she was a fresh patriot, and the idea of collecting awards for conservation, in her mind, was much like Baron collecting medals for killing reds in the War.
The green and gold of the Puffin Scouts represent nature and living blood respectively. Entwined, as here on her scarf, they mean the chaos and inhumanity of nature in Vekllei Semaphore.</description>

      <description>Lava was a modern walled city. It had long lost its walls, but its florid green belt disguised a complex network of trenches, tunnels and forts that linked emplacements in the surrounding mountains. Together, these systems would ensure Vekllei would never again have to tolerate occupation by a foreign power. Lava was on the outskirts of Vekllei’s great capital city, and much of its cityscape was dispersed, affording residents a slower pace of life.</description>

      <title>Robots in Vekllei</title>
      <link>https://millmint.net/posts/2021-01-11-automen/</link>

      <guid>https://millmint.net/posts/2021-01-11-automen/</guid>
      <description>The Vekllei word for a robot is automasiosn, or ‘automan’. When we talk about Vekllei being a “post-scarcity society,” it is by automen through which it happens. They are found across the entire country in all types of hard and boring work, forever dutiful, forever mindless. It is not that the robot has replaced the human worker, since about 90% of Vekllei people are employed. Instead, the automan takes its place in the necessary evils of industrial society, fulfilling the wildest fantasies of utopian industrialists; the factory is no longer just the place of the machine, it is in fact a machine itself.</description>

      <title>A New Year</title>
      <link>https://millmint.net/posts/2021-01-5-rocket/</link>

      <description>The New Year in Vekllei rings out during its months of darkness and cold. This calendar runs the regular affairs of the country, like it does the modern world. To Vekllei people, however, it is plain that New Years occurs not in darkness but instead in the summer solstice in June, the way it has for thousands of years in the dramatic cycles of light and dark in the country. In this sense, the end of December resonates among businesses and little else, much like the financial year elsewhere.</description>
