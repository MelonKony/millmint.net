This article predates the project, and should be considered non-canon.   Because the other girls would not stop calling her a lesbian, and because they had realised she was scared of loud noises and made use of that fact, Tzipora struck this bitch and her friend out beyond the football pitches after school. Tzipora was a good fighter â€” on her side is viciousness and a conviction to fight.</description>

This article predates the project, and should be considered non-canon.  She had always been a very serious girl, from the first time heâ€™d met her.
