This article appeared in Issue #7 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.  For all you&amp;rsquo;ve seen of Vekllei and her characters, you&amp;rsquo;ve never heard a single one of them speak. This post marks a little exploration into the Vekllei language, and a &amp;lsquo;soft launch&amp;rsquo; of my website, https://millmint.net. The proper launch will come at the end of the month.</description>

This article appeared in Issue #3 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.  Unique among girls Â¶  There are a lot of things Tzipora does differently to everybody else, and they start to make a lot more sense when you realise Tzipora either does not realise she is unusual, or does not care.</description>

This article appeared in Issue #2 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.  What is Vekllei?
Hi, Iâ€™m Hobart and I write and draw Vekllei at Studio MillMint.
This is a pretty complex project. Not just complex insofar as thereâ€™s a lot to read about it, but that it uses concepts and terminology you might not be familiar with if this is your first time around utopian fiction.</description>

      <title>The Vekllei Crown â€” coins of a moneyless country</title>

This article appeared in Issue #2 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.  Vekllei, legendarily, does not use circulate currency. Goods and services are moved and offered arbitrarily, provided amply in abundance. Anything that is not abundant is manufactured and distributed directly under the control of a bureau, which is a trade organ responsible to the affairs of the country.</description>

      <title>Meet Cobian, a concept panel for a Vekllei comic</title>
      <link>https://millmint.net/posts/2020-03-01-cobian/</link>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  If you go back through my posts here, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice Tzipora is basically a cartoon whose only consistent characteristic is her iconography &amp;ndash; her hair fountain, bangs, round head and big smile. This isn&amp;rsquo;t really intentional. I&amp;rsquo;m just an amateur artist who is still learning to draw.
That doesn&amp;rsquo;t work so well in a comic with sequential panels, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on standardising my characters.</description>

      <title>A Brief Introduction to Vekllei</title>
      <link>https://millmint.net/posts/2019-09-03-an-introduction/</link>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Editor&amp;rsquo;s note: this article, while ready for reading, is still under construction.
Considering both the length and convoluted terminology that embroil this project, there was only so long I could carry on before people started getting lost. The truth of it is that Vekllei is not a particularly complex or difficult project to summarise, despite the snapshot &amp;ldquo;lore in scenes&amp;rdquo; approach that kneecaps a complete understanding.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Vekllei is a country in my alt-world; a utopian fever dream of googie aesthetics, participatory economics and nostalgia.
Welcome to the â€˜Petticoat Projectâ€™, a collection of stories about a country and a girl.Â The concept is broken down into three sections:
 Author:Â for blog posts and articles on the Petticoat Project, utopian fiction, personal news item, etc. Character:Â for posts about Tzipora, people in her life, or otherwise events that occur during her time on Earth.</description>

      <title>Meet Tzipora Desmoines, the Eternal Teen-ager and Princess of the Earth</title>
      <link>https://millmint.net/posts/2019-05-27-character/</link>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  ðŸŒº This article predates the project, and should be considered non-canon.  This is Tzipora. She goes by two names &amp;ndash; Tzipora, her birth name, and Zelda, a name she mistakenly thought sounded less Jewish. She lives in Lola in the Vekllei city-state.
As an immigrant, she struggles with school but holds her own on in track and field, an inversion of her otherwise quiet and bookish nature.</description>
