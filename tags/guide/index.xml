&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint red&#34;&gt;
  ❖ &lt;strong&gt;This article&lt;/strong&gt; was featured in &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/newsdesk/bulletin/2020/7&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For all you&amp;rsquo;ve seen of Vekllei and her characters&lt;/strong&gt;, you&amp;rsquo;ve never heard a single one of them speak. This post marks a little exploration into the Vekllei language, and a &amp;lsquo;soft launch&amp;rsquo; of my website, &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net&#34;&gt;https://millmint.net&lt;/a&gt;. The proper launch will come at the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will briefly discuss some elements shown in this infographic, &lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net//utopia/vekllei/language&#34;&gt;but a large article on the language has been drafted here&lt;/a&gt;. If you have some interest in constructed language, and some of the more playful aspects of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s evolving utopian communication systems, I encourage you to take a look at it. The website is incomplete, and both the articles on characters and Vekllei itself are very incomplete. Otherwise, a growing archive, essays, and issues of the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; Bulletin are all available. Have a poke around, and let me know if anything breaks! The site has dark mode, if you&amp;rsquo;re a gamer. Just click the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;one-language-many-parts&#34;&gt;One Language, Many Parts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To borrow from the article linked above, the Vekllei language has six core systems often referred to as sublanguages. They are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net//utopia/vekllei/language/#21--spoken-vekllei&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoken Vekllei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is everyday spoken language. It draws from two glossaries with different meanings and feelings, called &lt;em&gt;Oa&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Loh&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net//utopia/vekllei/language/#22--topet&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which are logographic characters (occasionally characterised as hieroglyphs). Like other pictographic languages, &lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt; characters can be broken down into repeating components, called &lt;em&gt;Topotte&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net//utopia/vekllei/language/#23--rapotenne&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapotenne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is the traditional logographic language of names. It is much older than Topet, and has more in common with spiritual runes than modern logography.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net//utopia/vekllei/language/#24--potenne&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potenne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, lit. “&lt;em&gt;Hand-Talk&lt;/em&gt;”, is a sign language that incorporates gestures and signing to add meaning to emotion to spoken language, and occasionally in place of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net//utopia/vekllei/language/#25--upotenne&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upotenne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, lit. “&lt;em&gt;Spirit-Hand-Talk&lt;/em&gt;”, as the recreation of runes in human form, used limitedly in spiritual ritual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net//utopia/vekllei/language/#26--vekllei-semaphore&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei Semaphore&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the codification of colour and shape. Traditionally limited to colour, shape and pattern are now also included in &lt;em&gt;Vekllei Semaphore&lt;/em&gt;, in which full sentences can be formed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-this-picture&#34;&gt;In This Picture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see various parts of the Vekllei sublanguages on display, including &lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rapotenne&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Potenne&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Vekllei Semaphore&lt;/em&gt;. Before Cobian gets close enough to say hello, Tzipora has already delivered a devastating compliment via a simple three-finger tap to the palm, admiring how she looks. A couple of descriptions of Tzipora written in &lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt; have been annotated on her left, to demonstrate its use, including a tongue-twister (&amp;ldquo;She always tucks her shirt&amp;rdquo; becomes &amp;ldquo;Louisn Laismoh Loah Liousmineh&amp;rdquo;). You&amp;rsquo;ll notice &lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt; looks especially hieroglyphic, even by pictographic standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora&amp;rsquo;s full Blood Name is spelled out in &lt;em&gt;Rapotenne&lt;/em&gt; below, which is markedly different from &lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt; in history, characters and grammar. Most formal names in Vekllei employ a seal in place of writing it out in full ornamentation, which has been provided below along with a formal signature. Her signature is entirely pictographic; elements are arranged according to symbolic value, rather than phonological legibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the right, we can see an example of how Semaphore lives up to its name through its presence on flags, reinforcing and communicating information without conventional literacy. Also shown are a handful of basic symbols as they relate to authority, with the landscape of Vekllei superseding all human organs. Their colours matter, and so their meanings are more complex than what is described here &amp;ndash; for example, a small black circle refers to a human being, but an orange one refers to an arctic person (usually Vekllei).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have a breakdown of the word &lt;em&gt;comiya&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://millmint.net//utopia/vekllei/language/#222-phonetic-reading&#34;&gt;also looked at here&lt;/a&gt;), which means &amp;ldquo;friend.&amp;rdquo; Tzipora and Cobian are &lt;em&gt;comiya&lt;/em&gt;, and Moise and Cobian are&amp;hellip; sort of &lt;em&gt;comiya&lt;/em&gt;. The introduction here of &lt;em&gt;phonetic complements&lt;/em&gt;, which are duplicate consonant-pairs used to slightly alter the semantic meaning of a word without changing its pronunciation, allows the idea of a &amp;ldquo;friend&amp;rdquo; to be conceptualised in many different ways, to encompass all sorts of relationships. This one here implies a sort of naïve love (by using characters for late autumn, young woman and a glacial beach, all pronounced /k/.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limpettes are tails that underline vowel-forms called &lt;em&gt;hieyerette&lt;/em&gt; to enhance legibility. Although ornamented &lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt; has visually distinct consonant-pairings, business &lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt; does not generally use superscript and so limpettes designate the vowel-form. If you&amp;rsquo;re a bit lost, that&amp;rsquo;s okay. It&amp;rsquo;s in the main article, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to make this post too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can imagine then, even with only a handful of examples of language in practice here, how complex Vekllei can become as phonological and semantic meaning compound, combine and seperate in different forms and contexts. The spoken word can be altered by the physical gesture, and the physical gesture can be altered by the written word.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Meet Tzipora — concept panel for a Vekllei comic</title>

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint red&#34;&gt;
  ❖ &lt;strong&gt;This article&lt;/strong&gt; was featured in &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/newsdesk/bulletin/2020/3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;unique-among-girls&#34;&gt;Unique among girls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things Tzipora does differently to everybody else, and they start to make a lot more sense when you realise Tzipora either does not &lt;em&gt;realise&lt;/em&gt; she is unusual, or does not &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has a lot of endearing characteristics that give great character to her mannerisms and physicality. She has a small overbite that makes her look a little froggy, and ritually pulls on her shirt and wipes her nose in anxious conversation. She is round-headed and cuts her hair herself. She talks in a low, expressive voice. She has been poorly socialised in childhood, and is afraid of casual conversation with people she does not know. She is keenly socially attuned and feels awkwardness painfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wears the same clothes two or three days in a row. The outfits themselves are variations of the same thing, and her tastes don’t change. Everything hangs off her — she likes baggy, airy clothing, and upsizes to accomodate. She doesn’t like fashionable or voguish people, whom she regards as decadent and offensive. To Tzipora, taste is timeless and bound to the soul. In her case, this fact has held true — she has dressed the same as childhood, and very little else has changed about her in that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is paranoid and conservative, good-natured and austere, with a moral outlook bound by her deepest anxieties and obsessions. She is deeply spiritual and material, fascinated with objects and their history. She has many collections of many things she’s found. She’ll likely die a Catholic, but has a confrontational relationship with God and no longer attends mass, as a declaration of humanism. She does not know if this has pissed Him off, but it’s working out so far. Maybe that’s why He made her a homosexual — to get back at her. He must have a good sense of humour, if that’s the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora may be intense and inward-facing, but she can also be disarmingly charming and self-deprecating. She has a good sense of humour. There are not many girls that can so easily reconcile the contradictions between the peculiar and the healthy, the eccentric and the friendly, and the violent and the domestic. That’s part of her character — an essence of being that radiates decency, good taste and a respect for the spirit of all things.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is This Project?</title>

  Archived from the original article here
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint red&#34;&gt;
  ❖ &lt;strong&gt;This article&lt;/strong&gt; was featured in &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/newsdesk/bulletin/2020/2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Vekllei?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hi, I’m Hobart and I write and draw Vekllei&lt;/strong&gt; at Studio MillMint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty complex project. Not just complex insofar as there’s a lot to read about it, but that it uses concepts and terminology you might not be familiar with if this is your first time around utopian fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Vekllei is a utopia — what does this mean? It’s latin for “no place,” and I use that literally. Vekllei, in a literal sense, cannot exist. Not because I think it could never have existed, or that some part of it is completely unreasonable, or it breaks the laws of physics — but because it exists in a certain place and time that is just isn’t replicable. It’s all built from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei is a very good place to live, &lt;strong&gt;but it is not perfect&lt;/strong&gt;. Utopia does not mean “perfect place”. Utopia is a form of social dreaming, much like worldbuilding, linked to the values and priorities of its author. In utopian studies, “utopia” is usually broken down further:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eutopia&lt;/strong&gt; — “good place”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dystopia&lt;/strong&gt; — “bad place”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that both form a part of the “utopia” — this is appropriate, since Vekllei is grounded in a social realism that acknowledges the good and bad parts of life. Indeed, they are inseparable — you cannot have the light without the dark. Obviously, in my eyes, Vekllei is very much a eutopia.
You can read more about Vekllei (the country) by clicking here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three parts to my “social dreaming”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Landscape&lt;/strong&gt; — the world and country of Vekllei. When you think of “utopia,” this is it — shining modernist cities against striking landscapes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Character&lt;/strong&gt; — not all social dreaming takes place in spaces. Some of it is built around experiences, objects and relationships. Tzipora is a “character utopia” in the sense that she represents a utopian life experience, full of stories good and bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&lt;/strong&gt; — Vekllei is a representation of the problems of my life, as a form of escapism. A lot of my posts here reflect dissatisfactions and displacements in my own life — consumer society, commodification of childhood, wage labour, postmodernism, etc. I’m very much a part of this utopian dialectic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s run through some of the common queries and misunderstandings about Vekllei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are you?
&lt;em&gt;A Tasmanian illustrator.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re not Japanese?
&lt;em&gt;お前はもう死んでいる&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is Vekllei a utopia?
&lt;em&gt;It makes me feel better about my life and the world. It’s escapism; it’s a dream.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit cringe to grandstand your political beliefs, doncha think?
&lt;em&gt;Vekllei is a personal utopia. That’s what I’m selling. At least you’re getting good opinions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where’s the tension if it’s perfect?
&lt;em&gt;Vekllei is very cynical and tragic in places. Utopia is just a reflection of the author, good and bad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a novel? A story? A comic?
&lt;em&gt;I’m working on a comic right now. I’m pretty much working on Vekllei full-time so I’m hoping to announce it soon. I’ve got a lot of different Vekllei projects going.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where is Vekllei?
&lt;em&gt;Iceland.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does Vekllei look Japanese?
&lt;em&gt;Vekllei is like a country of Scandinavians speaking French with an Aussie accent in Shōwa era Japan/Maoist China/Taiwan etc. Vekllei looks however I imagine utopia looks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does that make sense?
&lt;em&gt;Why can’t it just be cool?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is your alt-history thought out?
&lt;em&gt;Vekllei’s history is whatever I need it to be. I’m always trying to be realistic, but it’s all worked backwards from the setting. I’m not really “worldbuilding” in a typical sense. Very little of it is published, most of it is retrieved on request. Just ask if you have questions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is Vekllei communist?
&lt;em&gt;No.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Vekllei calls itself “petticoat socialist”.
&lt;em&gt;Vekllei is set in a culture of Marxist revivalism in the 50s and 60s. A lot of Vekllei’s lexicon is set in that context. Vekllei is a decentralised democracy that doesn’t use money. It’s a sort of participatory economy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why the &amp;ldquo;petticoat&amp;rdquo;?
&lt;em&gt;Vekllei is a female country. Womanhood is decommodified. It&amp;rsquo;s maternal, social and friendly where socialist rhetoric is masculine, technocratic and progressive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is Zelda?
&lt;em&gt;Zelda is another name for Tzipora. She has two names specifically to confuse you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the “bulletin”?
&lt;em&gt;I publish the Atlantic Bulletin once a month via email. It’s got the month’s posts in it as well as facts and tidbits from Vekllei. DM me an email if you want to join.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  ❖ &lt;strong&gt;This article&lt;/strong&gt; was featured in &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/newsdesk/bulletin/2020/2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Map Key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red&lt;/strong&gt;: Magjet trains, 750km/h&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yellow&lt;/strong&gt;: Bullet trains, 300-400km/h&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orange&lt;/strong&gt;: Regional trains, &amp;lt;150km/h&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brown&lt;/strong&gt;: Local trains, including limited express, &amp;lt;100km/h&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blue&lt;/strong&gt;: National highway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dashed&lt;/strong&gt;: Ferry line&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green&lt;/strong&gt;: tarmacadamed airport&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The largest division of any portion of Vekllei land is the borough&lt;/strong&gt;; a region of varying size and population with common culture, food dependency and economic interest. Anything larger than that is simply Vekllei — they are “one city”, after all, and consider themselves a city-state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been exactly 100 boroughs since 2015. Each is named after the largest city in its region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The smallest borough is &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/bakur&#34;&gt;Bakur&lt;/a&gt;, in Afouismeh, with a population of 7,500 people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The largest is Vekllei proper, in the Capital Region, of 2.4 millions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transit map illustrates all 100 boroughs, Vekllei’s five tallest mountains, its permafrost glaciers and Tzipora’s home in Montre-Lola. Her five largest boroughs — namely Vekllei, Lonne, Adouisneh, Montre and Copette, are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in this simple transit map we can see several truths about the country, like its population bias on the West Coast and the emptiness of the Lava volcanic region. You might recognise a few names there, like Lola in the West (Tzipora’s home with Baron) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/landscape/boroughs/yana&#34;&gt;Yana&lt;/a&gt; in Vekllei’s Ro Highlands (Ayn’s birthplace).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trains are clean, reliable, fast, efficient and safe. They are incorporated under &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/cr65zu/the_people_of_veklleis_railway_plus_dog/&#34;&gt;Vekllei Rail&lt;/a&gt;, owned by the Transport Group Bureau. Using this map, designed for domestic tourists and foreigners, the adequacy of Vekllei’s rail transport is easy to plan around — you can eat breakfast in a cafe in the seaside town of Mumen, and hike before midday on the glacial slopes of Askayoisn. Since there are no tickets or costs, there are no excuses for not visiting relatives in the country, now that transport is now a trivial inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each borough is represented in Vekllei’s parliament by an elected representative. These representatives wield extraordinarily disproportionate power — the representative for Callaisn, for example, represents hundreds of times more people than the representative for Tanger, but both have the same vote. This is because boroughs are not just representative of their populations, but also their environments, industry and other social organs otherwise unable to vote. It is important to keep in mind that Upen (and consequently, policy) recognises the landscape itself as the sovereign organ of the country, and so in this sense it has its own interests and projections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, representatives act in an advisory, nonpartisan role in government, voting rarely in an auxiliary role to the professionalised, elected legislature. Vekllei has a strictly constitutional parliament, and the economy largely prohibits interference. In this sense, the parliament is both partially undemocratic in its inefficiency and apolitical in its orientation as a sort of civil service bureau, managing state affairs and reacting to pressures and the long-term aims outlined in the 2015 constitution. In the Vekllei mindset, the “government” is more or less another bureau, no different or particularly more interesting than the Transport Group Bureau. The trains, at least, have a tangible impact on their daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How appropriate, then, that this transit map produced in the summer months of 2076 combines both monuments of society. It also offers a glimpse of a larger, documented country not necessarily revealed in piecemeal story posts.&lt;/p&gt;

  Archived from the original article here
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint red&#34;&gt;
  ❖ &lt;strong&gt;This article&lt;/strong&gt; was featured in &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/newsdesk/bulletin/2020/2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei, legendarily, does not use circulate currency&lt;/strong&gt;. Goods and services are moved and offered arbitrarily, provided amply in abundance. Anything that is not abundant is manufactured and distributed directly under the control of a bureau, which is a trade organ responsible to the affairs of the country. At no point do coins or paper currency change hands in the day-to-day affairs of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, Vekllei is usually described as “moneyless” — yet it does in fact have a currency. The Vekllei Kroner, or “Crown,” is hundreds of years old, and Vekllei still operates a mint for currency. At any time, a Vekllei person can write to the National Mint and order a set of coins, like the ones pictured above. So what is going on here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Kroner has not been used since 2022, after the last village in Stochi returned coinage to the Mint, it continues to exist to this day as a gold-backed currency in the International Market, through which Vekllei trades with other countries. The physical coins, produced mostly as a novelty in the tradition of &lt;em&gt;mayaesdiou&lt;/em&gt; (medallions, or small metal pieces commonly collected and given in Vekllei), are a physical coinage of the International Market. The coins also operate as a form of bullion, or wealth reserve, since each coin is worth exactly its face value in gold. Since the International Market is completely closed and independent of the domestic economy, its value is controlled directly by the so-called Government Bank. It is one of the few gold-backed currencies in a developed nation today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further complicate things, there are actually two different Kroner in Vekllei. There is the &lt;strong&gt;Vekllei Kroner&lt;/strong&gt;, which represents the International Market, but there is also a seperate &lt;strong&gt;Government/State Kroner&lt;/strong&gt;, which is not minted and used only as an investment mechanism, backed by government &amp;ldquo;white bonds&amp;rdquo; which are usually measures of labour-hours or refined materials. It is, in a sense, a fiat currency alongside a gold-backed currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They exist independently because they are used for two seperate purposes. The Vekllei Kroner is used a wealth reserve and bullion, and also represents the collective wealth of the Vekllei people. Each citizen, in theory, is entitled to an equal share of the Government Bank, although it can only be withdrawn as currency in specific circumstances. Vekllei also holds substantial amounts of foreign currency in the Government Bank and Vekllei Kroner, which is used to invest and stabilise holdings and capital in foreign countries. The Government Kroner, on the other hand, is used as an investment mechanism abroad, usually in support of infrastructure. It is also used to acquire foreign currencies through investment in foreign capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite having two currencies, neither the &amp;ldquo;Vekllei Crown&amp;rdquo; or the &amp;ldquo;Government Crown&amp;rdquo; are used in the domestic economy in Vekllei, which is autonomous and not subject to a central bank. So it is that Vekllei’s currency is both little more than a novelty and essential to the function of the country in a world still ruled by money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the coinage depicted above — 8 coins are minted in Vekllei today.&lt;/strong&gt; They were designed in 2015, in the year of independence. They represent eight core values in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “small crowns,” worth 1VK and 10VK respectively, represent fraternity and liberty, two founding elements of the Vekllei constitution. The 50VK coin is plated in silver and has a small ruby inset. Rubies are used to represent energy, in this case, the vitality of the spirits, which dominate Upen and the Vekllei landscape. The 100, 200, 500 and 1,000VK coins represent different landscapes of the country. As a volcanic island nation, the ocean (100) and landscape (200) coins are fairly straightforward. The humanity coin (500) represents the Vekllei people and ancestry — note how humans are placed alongside other natural forces. The flower coin (1,000VK) represents the flowers of the country, which are important spiritually and have formed part of the Vekllei identity. Vekllei has the most flowers per capita in the world. The final, larger 10,000VK coin represents the previous seven together, as a total sum of Vekllei landscape and identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer Tzipora’s question — a bottle of fizzy drink cost about 2VK in the waning days of coinage in the early 2020s.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Meet Cobian, a concept panel for a Vekllei comic</title>

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you go back through my posts here, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice Tzipora is basically a cartoon whose only consistent characteristic is her iconography &amp;ndash; her hair fountain, bangs, round head and big smile. This isn&amp;rsquo;t really intentional. I&amp;rsquo;m just an amateur artist who is still learning to draw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;rsquo;t work so well in a comic with sequential panels, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on standardising my characters. This is a concept panel for Cobian, Tzipora&amp;rsquo;s longtime friend (and occasional girlfriend). She&amp;rsquo;s an awkward, sympathetic sort of person, and often left out in my posts. She certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t deserve such treatment &amp;ndash; she&amp;rsquo;s one of the most interesting, complex people in the Vekllei cast and I hope to treat her with respect in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This panel is the first step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m working on pages for the comic, but it&amp;rsquo;s slow going. I post pages as they come to my patrons (more or less!) but it&amp;rsquo;ll be a while before any chapters come together. That&amp;rsquo;s okay. I work better that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love,&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Brief Introduction to Vekllei</title>

&lt;a  href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/czi423/a_brief_introduction_to_vekllei/&#34;   target=&#34;_blank&#34;  class=&#34;book-btn&#34;&gt;
  Archived from the original article here
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor&amp;rsquo;s note: this article, while ready for reading, is still under construction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering both the length and convoluted terminology that embroil this project, there was only so long I could carry on before people started getting lost. The truth of it is that Vekllei is not a particularly complex or difficult project to summarise, despite the snapshot &amp;ldquo;lore in scenes&amp;rdquo; approach that kneecaps a complete understanding. I&amp;rsquo;m just lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Vekllei is not a particularly challenging idea. It is unique, but some days that&amp;rsquo;s about all it has going for it. The word itself — &lt;strong&gt;Vekllei&lt;/strong&gt; — refers to both the landscape and the people of an island we know as Iceland. This project looks at that country and its people across a span of about fifty years, mostly between 2070 and 2120. As an alt-history, timelines diverge between our world and theirs in the 1940s, although Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s history is much older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vekllei is utopia, but Vekllei is not perfect&lt;/em&gt;. It is constructed under a framework of &lt;em&gt;utopie concrète&lt;/em&gt;, where dreamlike landscapes and characters collide with the dirt and dysfunction of reality. To some people, the contradictions and imperfection of Vekllei society would disqualify it as utopia, especially in an orthodox understanding of the idea, but Western cultural orthodoxy is not the metric used by a Vekllei person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei people instead use Vekllei cultural metrics, and to a Vekllei person it is the patina of things — its imperfections and tragedy — that recognise the beauty in life itself, as markers of both existence and usefulness. This cultural intuition is a central tenant of &lt;strong&gt;Upen&lt;/strong&gt;, Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s nondenominational animism and universal spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, Vekllei is undeniably heavenly. It is a gorgeous country of spiritual satisfaction and earnest friendship. Your first day in Vekllei is a dizzying spiritual experience. The weight of the world seems to shift, and then rise off your shoulders. Colour and vitality disentangle themselves from injustice and consumption and pivot to meet you. Food is good and free, strangers are friendly and bursting with lively purposefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei understands itself as a city-state. This colours a lot of how Vekllei people think of themselves. In practice, there are many distinct &amp;lsquo;cities&amp;rsquo; — the Capital, Little Vekllei, Copette, Ro, Montre and Adouisneh are the largest of them — but they are not recognised as such or federated in Vekllei geographic lexicon. Vekllei is a single continuous neighbourhood, circling nearly the entire coast of their island. Vekllei is also the land on which they sit, which predates the country by millions of years and informs many principles of Upen, which go on to manifest in public policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei cities are almost entirely built according to a single architectural school, &lt;strong&gt;Newda&lt;/strong&gt;, which manifests in many different ways but is almost always obviously a flavour of midcentury modernism. Water and concrete define Vekllei cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vekllei flag is an unornamented purplish red, known as the &amp;lsquo;Domestic Standard&amp;rsquo;. Internationally, they employ a highly decorated flag called the &amp;lsquo;International Standard,&amp;rsquo; which features both the &lt;em&gt;Oa&lt;/em&gt; national flower (and omnipresent symbol in every corner of society) and Vekllei logographic script, called &lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei has five language systems, which contribute to the single national language &amp;ndash; also called Vekllei. There is spoken Vekllei,  &lt;strong&gt;Topet&lt;/strong&gt; (logographic Vekllei script), &lt;strong&gt;Rapotenne&lt;/strong&gt; (name-script), &lt;strong&gt;Vekllei semaphore&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Potenne&lt;/strong&gt; (hand-talk) or &lt;strong&gt;Upotenne&lt;/strong&gt; (spirit-hand-talk). Potenne is a sign language used with or in place of speech, and Upotenne is a way of manifesting physical runes specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei cities are very colourful, because colour has great meaning. You can construct sentences using only colour and shapes through Vekllei semaphore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sort of lifestyle is possible because of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s abolishment of work, commodity and consumption. In the case of Vekllei, this means that people do not use money and work only for personal benefit, as both ways of actualising themselves and keeping useful or socialising. Not all work is equally difficult or interesting, but everyone must work in fairness. For some, that means as little as a few hours a week copy-editing neighbourhood newsletters. For others, they may work weeks without days off. The consequence of this is that value and products are valueless in any real sense, as post-scarcity relegates the functioning Vekllei economy to autonomous overproduction and waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of why people work is not an especially difficult one. In Vekllei, where money has not existed for a long time and generations are raised without it, basic premises of motivation have been reconsidered. Life in Vekllei is mostly a largely individual march towards actualisation, through several avenues of pleasure. There is the enjoyment of food and culture, the intimacy of love and marriage, the heritage in family and blood, and the power of work and professional legacy. Only a handful of these contribute to the pleasure of work, but in a society that has mostly done away with menial work through automation and advanced robotics, pleasure is mostly what you make of it. In Vekllei, this is called &lt;strong&gt;Product Socialism&lt;/strong&gt;, an inaccurate nominer that describes both the bureau system of work and distribution and Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s fundamental syndicalism. In politics, it is called &lt;strong&gt;Sundress Municipalism&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of life for almost any other person in today&amp;rsquo;s world, however, has declined slowly by nearly any metric. People are, on average, poorer and hungrier than they were fifty years ago. Various contradictions — in startling contrast to Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s own schisms — have left previously dignified superpowers in disorienting cycles of bloodshed and madness. In the U.S., a large number of confederate states have reasserted their sovereignty following the collapse of the Ford Motor Company and the Northrop corporation. Cultural reforms in Red China have left vast wings of the CCP disatissfied with current leadership, with whispers of a coup. Western Europe has rediscovered her reactionary heritage and indulged in a serious of increasingly authoritarian traditionalist movements, and the export economy of the Soviet Union has collapsed after the shift towards atomic fuels. Vekllei rejects millions of applications for asylum each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circumstance of the world is only made more tragic by the relative peace and stability of Vekllei, and the simplicity and carefree lifestyle of the average Vekllei person. Vekllei has the most flowers per capita of any country in the world. The last fifty years has seen the melting of much of the poles and the the introduction of el nino summers and instant winters that wrack Germany, Austria, Italy, and much of temperate Europe. The Adriatic seems to see more gloom than mediterranean sun these days. The equatorial deserts of the world, Nevada included, are mere degrees away from unsurvivable. With temperatures frequently breaking 50C (125F) throughout the year, it thins the population of Southerners too old or too poor to avoid the heat. North Africa is a husk. There is no water and no food. There is a reason there are mass graves all across the shores of the Black Sea, and why Europe tastes the boot. There is a reason the southern African states are crumbling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vekllei, with her extreme daylight cycles and polar latitude, the weather has improved significantly. Summers are warm enough to host outdoor activities for much of the season and winters are milder than previously, rarely dropping below freezing. Vekllei life, in its insular fashion, has been somewhat improved by the destabilisation of the climate. Lush temperate rainforests cover much of its lowlying basins, and rich volcanic soils spoil agricultural endevour in the warm seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s current prosperity has enabled the country to embark on her final project. The benefits of industrialisation and contemporary post-scarcity are employed in a serious effort to reestablish localised, agrarian life built upon the unit of the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei understands the the achievements of industry as a liberationist tool to return to preindustrial, satisfying life. It is not as though the country will abolish three centuries of tremendous progress — quite the contrary, in fact. But understood through petticoat ideology, the marriage of labour and the ordinary person can only occur through self-satisfying, personal work. This is in contrast, one can suppose, to mechanised, industrial labour to which we owe our enormous wealth. To a Vekllei person, work is social, productive, creative and satisfying. The simple pleasures of agriculture; specialised craftsman and tradesman; artistry — these are the fruits only of a society that can afford them, since they necessitate the deindustrialisation of agriculture, factory manufacturing and mass media simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So even though Vekllei is by all measures an industrial society; a land of helijets and plenty; the people of this country see automation as the deindustrialisation of society, at least culturally — a return to community employment, decentralised agriculture and tending of the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei is a fundamentally female country. This is what &lt;strong&gt;petticoat society&lt;/strong&gt; means. There are plenty of men in it, and quite distinct social constructs for men and women exist in a way that distinguishes the country from traditional progressive projects, but the feminisation of the economy and politics remains. Vekllei economic gender theory understands masculinity as first and foremost a  value to be consumed in industrial society, in a perverse sort of value exchange. Men are first commodified and then broken through work, killed in wars, are suffocated emotionally, and so forth. The very premise of  manhood, as the 1950s understands it (which this world is very much immersed in) is not just a biological or social construct, but an economic one. As Vekllei progresses, and erases these identifiers of masculinity, men will become female first in an economic sense (in a process called economic feminisation), and will eventually become females socially also. These are gender constructs that are essentially still prescribed by traditional Vekllei values, but are tied to the  deindustrialisation of the country. The perfect Vekllei society is one in which the man dies with the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Vekllei is not a traditional egalitarian experiment, and is often a land of absurd contradiction in Western political tradition, Vekllei women enjoy a society built for them. Womanhood in the country is not defined by commodity or appearance, but by ideas the culture associates with womanhood — compassion, bravery, intelligence, grace, etc. They are defined not by their relationships or their economic circumstance, but by their friends, political opinions, ability, etc. The decommodification of society has also decommodified womanhood. Vekllei is not simply a good place to be a woman, but is in fact a female country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you might have notices a certain set of recurring characters. The girl with short dark hair is Tzipora Desmoines, the character of utopia in this project. Her adoptive father, Baron, is bearded and wears half-framed spectacles. Her friend, Cobian, wears round spectacles and her hair in a ponytail. Their mutual friend, Moise, is heavy-set and has curly hair. Together, they represent a broad demographic of Vekllei people. Baron is descended from Nordic caucasians; vikings from Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s initial settlement. Tzipora and Cobian are descended from both inuits and Scandinavians, in the population explosion that followed Inuit settlement in the Danish territory. Moise is descended from Greek immigrants in the tide of immigration that followed the immediate postwar era. Although there are Vekllei people of colour, they make up a minority of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, this guide has helped to introduce you to the world in which Vekllei is situatated. I&amp;rsquo;m likely to expand in the coming days on this section, so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a world of nuclear power, gingham and moon colonisation wrapped in the aesthetic of the 50s/60s. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of poverty and suffering in it, but also tremendous hope. Vekllei is utopia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vekllei is a country in my alt-world; a utopian fever dream of googie aesthetics, participatory economics and nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the ‘Petticoat Project’, a collection of stories about a country and a girl. The concept is broken down into three sections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt; for blog posts and articles on the Petticoat Project, utopian fiction, personal news item, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Character:&lt;/strong&gt; for posts about Tzipora, people in her life, or otherwise events that occur during her time on Earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Landscape:&lt;/strong&gt; for articles on Vekllei and her society, incorporating all that goes with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, read on for an introduction to this project and what I intend to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-epilogue-to-the-epoch-of-rest&#34;&gt;The Epilogue to the Epoch of Rest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core of the Vekllei project is in understanding utopian fiction as a viable means for expressing yourself in two arenas. Creative, as a way of articulating a worldview, and personal, as a way of introspection and projection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the creative worldview is that of Vekllei  — a thought experiment in economics, socialpolitik, infrastructure, architecture, demographics, spirituality, language, actualisation, etc. The personal product is Tzipora — a character of good mannerisms, language, sense of fashion, ideological disposition, personality and body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise of an epoch of rest is that the problems unique to an author, the conductor of the orchestra, can be reasoned with and turned into beautiful monuments in a way they can’t in reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running low on money? Vekllei does not use money  — go to a cinema, eat out; have a nice time. Likewise, are you shameful of your body or your ability? Tzipora is fraught with problems, too — but look at her! She is beautiful. Repeat this process for all creative arenas and you will find a world you can escape to, away from the problems of your reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that utopia and perfection are two different things. A city can be utopian without it being perfect  — a relative judgement. Carrying on in this sense, the concept of utopia can equally be applied to a person. The character is not necessarily a romantic interest or charming or intelligent or sexual product, because none of those things really describe utopia  — instead, a person (a utopian?) is perfect as a collection of ideas and experience. Vekllei is a place of utopia, Tzipora is utopian. And so there are three actors in this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-author&#34;&gt;The Author&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The producer of the whole thing, the creative and personal products are theirs, as unique as a fingerprint. They most likely produce a lot of different societies and characters in trying to tell a story, or flesh out an idea they’ve had  — but for the purposes of the idea of an epoch of rest, there are two perfect utopias: landscape (society and the world), and character (personality and appearance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vekllei-vɛklaɪ&#34;&gt;Vekllei [/vƐk.laɪ/]&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei is a country in which the external burdens of the world can be shifted. Worries are relegated to the personal  — an arena in utopian fiction that conveniently still falls under the domain of the author. In Vekllei, self-actualisation is tangible, vivid, only metres away. It might be in creativity or power or love, but it is attainable, because the economic and cultural orchestra of the country is in the imagination of the author, and so it is perfect as by definition of utopia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tziporazelda-desmoines-dzɪpˈɔːrədɛmwəːnɛːh&#34;&gt;Tzipora/Zelda Desmoines [/dzɪpˈɔːr.ə’dƐm.wəːn.Ɛːh/]&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Vekllei is the arena of external burden, Tzipora is a girl on which the internal pressures of self-doubt and conscious flaw are cast aside like a rag. In the sense of a narrative, Tzipora might suffer because of her behaviours (her nervous tics, her jealousy, her body and image), but they are adopted in a way that is graceful. So despite her fierce problems, it fades away in the fact that she will not die; she will not be unsuccessful; she will not be unloved. As long as those core premises are true, then every other nervous tic or obsessive-compulsive behaviour are commodity; window-dressing to an aesthetic taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is sort of what I want to do, and I can’t imagine slowing down anytime soon. Stick around and I’ll do my best materialise the world and story of Vekllei. Thanks for stopping by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind regards,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hobart Phillips&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Tzipora. She goes by two names &amp;ndash; Tzipora, her birth name, and Zelda, a name she mistakenly thought sounded less Jewish. She lives in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/blqcwl/utopia_the_participatory_economy_of_vekllei/&#34;&gt;Lola&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/vekllei.city/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_0555.png?ssl=1&#34;&gt;Vekllei city-state&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an immigrant, she struggles with school but holds her own on in track and field, an inversion of her otherwise quiet and bookish nature. She is intimidated by pretty girls and can throw a half-decent punch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genetic-freak&#34;&gt;Genetic Freak&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gregori babies, as they&amp;rsquo;re called, suffer from Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome. It&amp;rsquo;s usually described as agelessness at menarche, since about 90% of cases are girls. It&amp;rsquo;s essentially a genetic malfunction that puts the body in a cycle of eternal growth &amp;ndash; they effectively continue to grow (without actually growing bigger), but do not develop and are more or less suspended at the onset of their first period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether they&amp;rsquo;re &amp;lsquo;mentally&amp;rsquo; children is an interesting one that there&amp;rsquo;s not a simple answer to. Their minds are not fully developed the way an adult human&amp;rsquo;s would be, since ageing stops in early teen-age years and before pubescence. They tend to retain some childish characteristics &amp;ndash; mostly decision-making and emotional control. But this sort of speculation risks dehumanising otherwise very functional and capable people. The effects of long-term childhood and social isolation are far more profound on the personality of a Gregori child than any biological limitation or squabbling about the teen-age/adult schism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boys can also have it, but are always hyperallergic and suffer from a broad anaphylaxis at onset of the condition (usually a little earlier, in early thelarche at 8-10y/o). It will almost always kill them. The discrepancy between the sexes is still being researched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Girls also have a risk of developing hyperallergies. Gregori babies have never developed cancers as far as anyone is aware, and these hyperallergies are a result of this hyperactive immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gregori babies fulfill the first of two miracles required for sainthood in the Catholic Church. In other parts of the world they are targets of violence as practicers of witchcraft or demonic pacts. The oldest Gregori baby, Tzipora Desmoines, is 120 years old and is set to overtake the human lifespan. She was 13th overall to have been diagnosed, but Gregori children have high mortality rates (largely violence, car accidents and suicides) and she is the first to pass 60 years of age. So, somewhat ironically, the children with speculated immortality almost always die young.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;knowing-her&#34;&gt;Knowing her&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of how Tzipora would be remembered would be in the way she appeared in the person. She was a good-looking young teen-ager of quiet and unusual movements. As she became known to the wider public, her physical appearance would come to define her as both a phenomena and disability — a victim of blessings; a sweet child of cotton and gingham carrying on in the dark schism between teen-age impetuosity and the adult world of &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt;. What a tragedy and miracle she was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zelda, which was how she introduced herself among friends, was as intricate as she was indecipherable. She had her own internal logics; a unique carousel of intuition that marked her out as some unfortunate &lt;em&gt;undamoispotet&lt;/em&gt; among other teen-agers. In conversation that stirred any emotion in her she was susceptible to spasmodic, defensive movements that distracted from her talking. Most frequently she would pull on her nose as if to wipe it, or reach for her shirt at the shoulder and adjust it. If she was particularly self-conscious, which could be brought on even by the spasms themselves, she would take hold of her shirt and keep her hand there, as though her thin girlish arms could shield her breast from judgement. She confided in her father that she did not like the tics. The more conscious of her imperfections she was, the more her idiosyncrasies flared. He asked her once how long she’d had them — the nose rubbings, the shirt pullings — and she said she couldn’t remember, but thought it might have been after she arrived in America. Which was possible, he supposed — trauma could bring on tics, even laymen knew that. If you spend a while with her, however, it becomes more obvious that her tics are symptomatic of a nervous, fidgety subconscious not cowed by the supposed tomboyishness of her movements — she jigs a leg, and run the back of her hand beneath her nose. Then, when she realises people notice those things and judge her for them, the same synchronistic hyperactivities became shirt-pulling and face-touching.&lt;/p&gt;
