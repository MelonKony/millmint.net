&lt;p&gt;I’m still eating pudding, but once I’m home tomorrow and settled at my drawing desk I’ll be sure to report Tzipora’s holiday adventures in full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Christmasfolk out there, enjoy your presents. To everyone else, have a good holiday and be sure to celebrate the Australian way — with prawns, salmon and snags on the barbie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Gorgeous 25°C [77°F] yesterday)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best,&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Kodak Moment by a Vekllei Geyser</title>

&lt;p&gt;In her journal for practicing writing the Vekllei language (appropriately called Vekllei), Tzipora wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heavy clouds above were children of early spring, but among the steam vents it seemed like the whole sky was polluted by geysers. Large pools, opalescent with healthy minerals, were heated by the core of the Earth. In a volcanic desert of black sand, the geysers were an oasis, rising from the sulphuric fog like a little eden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her study was well beyond mere communication by now, venturing further into the pleasures of language and poetry. It made her smile to think back at where she’d been just five years before. She recalled images of a nervous immigrant thumbing through her dictionary at a tram stop, terrified of the nonsense characters around her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geysers are the heart of Vekllei spiritualism. The town of Geyser in Vekllei is in fact the origin of the word. They are symptomatic of Vekllei’s naturalistic statehood — a testament to the impermanence of landscape and the symbiosis of people and soil. The geysers, once barren jewels of harsh volcanic landscapes, were now ringed by foliage at their edges as the seeds unwittingly carried by travellers blossomed in rich volcanic earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei people will visit from a young age. Nothing is signposted — there is no natural infrastructure. Several deaths a year are reported. As a Vekllei child you develop a relationship with your spring, and learn its unique qualities. Where it is safe to draw water, for example, and where it will boil your skin in a flash. You learn its colour and smell. In rural communities, they are an essential organ, where birth and marriage and death coalesce. Vekllei heritage is not dominated by blood, but by earth, and no clearer are the sites of life than amidst her ancient volcanoes, where the wind carries steam across dark igneous slopes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Life and Death in Vekllei Apartment Ideology</title>
      <link>https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-12-20-apartment/</link>

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To substitute for my shocking (and deeply shameful) absence over the last two weeks, please accept a longer-form post concerning domestic Apartment Ideology in Vekllei, which they call&lt;/em&gt; Newda &lt;em&gt;and is known internationally as The Vekllei Newda School. Pictured is the apartment of our very own Zelda. While the building itself deserves a feature, for now we’ll discuss Newda as a theory and her life in this building. If you get bogged down and pissed off at the jargon, skip to the “practice” section. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how I feel about this post, I might have indulged too much, but either way, I&amp;rsquo;m BACK&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;ndash;  Hobart&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;argument&#34;&gt;Argument&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A man of the eighteenth century, plunged suddenly into our civilisation, might well have the impression of something akin to a nightmare.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Frederick Etchells, &lt;em&gt;Towards a New Architecture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some critics of architecture (and adjacent slugs) deride &lt;em&gt;Newda&lt;/em&gt; as decadent. It is as incestuous and plastic as most other modernist constructions, they say. It mistakes austerity for utility, and &lt;em&gt;le blanc&lt;/em&gt; for cleanliness. This is not an unreasonable criticism, especially since foundational Vekllei cultural principles of natural immersion and human decay seem irreconcilable with the white, shining concrete of her modern cityscape. How does a style like &lt;em&gt;Newda&lt;/em&gt; claim to be anything other than a reckless adoption of continental urbanism for its own sake; a symptom of the social decay we call postwar austerity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these people, &lt;em&gt;Newda&lt;/em&gt; represents a grotesque squandering of a rare, virgin landscape which had been wiped clean in the atomic war. It is impossible to imagine any other means by which the opportunity to rebuild today’s modern cities might arise. She could have been Paris, critics say — entirely unaware that they are discussing a city more beautiful than Paris. “Oh, to see Rome reduced to urbanist tower-blocks”; “a garden city of concrete and asbestos”; “a cauldron of plastic and rebar”; and so on go the tears. “Never had tacky decadence looked so plain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There exists a new spirit,” Le Corbusier wrote in &lt;em&gt;Towards a New Architecture&lt;/em&gt;. “Our own epoch is determining, day by day, its own style. Our eyes, unhappily, are unable yet to discern it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a tantalising phrase that was, when it finally reached Vekllei’s shores from his native France. Not just for its celebration of a young era, which appeals to Vekllei’s fluid and agnostic antihistoricism, but for its appeal to “spirit”, which gestures towards the intimate and gentle Vekllei nature. Hence the critics’ fundamental mischaracterisation of Vekllei’s great modernist project — namely that the country understands nature as an organ alienated from their “civilisation,” or that they recognise their æsthetics as a progression of history. Neither is true, as is plain to anyone who has been to any part of Vekllei. Landscape is suppressed in Vekllei, even in an industrial age, and so there is no schism between the human and the natural worlds despite the fact that they live in tower-blocks and wear clothes of rayon and gingham. And “History” in Vekllei is gutted as easily as they might a tuna for which their cuisine is known; their collective story as a state is one of movements and gestures, laterally and lineally at times, and “backwards” at others (although to apply such a word to Vekllei is to criminally misunderstand her project).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the application of sickly sentimentalist instincts to Vekllei that betray the reactionary criticism of Newda as a “superficial, austere school of architecture” for what it is; a deeply historicist suspicion ingrained in the same modernist instincts it claims to critique; at once fucking and wagging a finger at the pig. It is also a brash rejection of Vekllei sociology as a foundation of petticoat ideology, and mistakes Vekllei’s “material culture” (her buildings, her clothes, her toys) as something somehow disconnected from so-called &amp;ldquo;petticoat intuition&amp;rdquo;, which is just a phrase for the social unconscious that forms consensus in the country on everything from television soaps to her beloved tower-blocks. This is aesthetics in action, what Hegel praised in &lt;em&gt;The Philosophy of Right&lt;/em&gt; as “philosophising, which could well have continued to spin itself into its own web of scholastic wisdom, [coming] into closer contact with actuality.” &lt;em&gt;Newda&lt;/em&gt; is real, and it is alive in the instincts of the ordinary Vekllei person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paris can burn. &lt;em&gt;Newda&lt;/em&gt; will survive a thousand atomic strikes, through that cockroach known as ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not let Vekllei architecture, which might be assaulted by promiscuous subjectivity or the bores of American objectivity, be discussed in anything but a sociological arena. When talking about Vekllei things, it is a mistake to rely on uniquely Western (or otherwise) constructs. As Adorno noted in &lt;em&gt;Aesthetics&lt;/em&gt;, taste is preprogrammed — the “sublime,” so it is invoked, is spiritual phenomenology, dependent on so-called objectivity only insofar as objectivity relates to your postcode and personal wealth. &lt;strong&gt;Tell a man he is listening to a Stradivarius and replace it with any other violin, and watch the sublime grow mold.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;theory&#34;&gt;Theory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decoration has nothing to do with sophistication, nor spirituality. Vekllei is characterised by honesty as a premise in itself — not in how they talk or how they do business, but in the frankness and clarity of Vekllei culture in ideology and its cities. “Honesty” is to make plain the exact functioning and beneficiaries of the economy; the production and movement of commercial goods; the labour and value of “commodities”; and the material and operation of machines and structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So too should it inform the foundations of life. Housing is one of the greatest urgencies in the mind — and so architecture should respond to urgency with the solidity and reliability required of it. That essence, or “form,” is the premise of a structure, and it requires the reestablishment of architecture not as “style” but as an ideology built upon a place of living defined by form, purpose, and purity. Newda is characterised by large light wells, common areas, the integration of civic essentials (like food-production, hydroponics, gardens, shallow pools for washing and bathing), and expression through shape. In form, Newda is defined by strong vertical geometry, the baring of utility including pipes and water tanks, and strong colour. Newda structures are constructed in béton brut, even in smaller villages, abiding by the principles of &lt;em&gt;dumousiantopet&lt;/em&gt;, or ‘beautiful and seperate’. A Newda structure is large enough to house a community but appears gentle and lightweight, since it perches majestically on large columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many types of Newda buildings designed in many different languages and principles of architecture, but I’m approaching the character limit here so we’ll pursue them another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;practice&#34;&gt;Practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a tour with Zelda on her journey inside her building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facing the street is a conservatory atrium of ten stories, which is filled with trees. It opens out into the air at its base, since the entire structure is raised on elegant columns that encourage the ground floor as a place of public living. The path to the central elevator towers are lined on each side by a wading pool with a depth of one meter — the pool tiles are bright-coloured and contrast each other. They make a good place to cool your feet in summer. Since the load of the structure is vested in columns in the interior, glass encircles the atrium façade like a ribbon, serving as a natural lightwell and growing space for produce-bearing plants which supplement the Vekllei diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zelda calls an elevator at the free-standing tower, since she lives on the eighth floor. The elevator is glass-lined and she soars up through the canopy of the indoor forest as it moves. The apartments of the eighth floor open into lome a’ pasænet or an ‘internal street’. These are found in most Vekllei apartment buildings. The street is a long balcony, decadently wide, that runs the length of the interior and connects the five apartments of that floor. Large glass windows in the apartments look out into the internal street, or are hidden with curtains in times of privacy. The street is a popular place to read or meet friends and neighbours, since the yawning interior multiplies the sense of space tenfold, and it received direct sunlight throughout most of the day. At sunset, the glass façade of the public interior casts a warm, fantastical light on the ten streets of the ten-story building, transforming the space into a prismatic cathedral of light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping in to the footwell of the apartment, Zelda removes her shoes. There’s some rumour about the custom dating back to the Viking days as a sign of peaceful intention, but today it’s for cleanliness. The living room is sunken, and is lighted by the windows looking out into the interior street, which receive sun about the time she comes home. The kitchen overlooks the living space and indoor fig, and includes a large partition/cupboard that can roll on rails across the width of the apartment. There are many small examples of similar modularity throughout the apartment, balanced carefully with Newda’s affection for permanence. Pipes run beneath the concrete for underfloor heating, providing toasty floors in Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s dark, brutal winters.
The apartment is divided between a semi-public half, which includes the living, dining and cooking areas, and a ‘private half’ which contains the two bedrooms, bathroom and laundry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zelda took the larger bedroom despite her initial protestations — Baron insisted, and so that’s where she spends all her time when he’s not home. It’s by far the biggest space she’s ever had to herself. In fact, thinking back, this is the first room she hasn’t had to share since she was ten. In other buildings it would be large enough to house a cramped studio apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next door is the bathroom. There, you&amp;rsquo;ll find a French bidet, which is separated by a wall from what looks like, at first glance, a modest oriental wet room and bath. The precise opposite is true. It is a Vekllei (that is to say, Scandinavian) wet room. Instead of cleaning your body with a shower and bucket and then soaking in a hot bath, a Vekllei person scalds their skin until it glows and then plunges into a tub of cold water. The contrast of temperature encourages vasodilation and then constriction of the circulatory system, which, in addition to the hydrostatic pressure supplied by the bath, invigorates the skin and can help with muscle fatigue. Some experts believe it may aid the immune system. Vekllei bathers generally do not spend luxurious amounts of time in the bath or shower — cleaning is a utilitarian process, which, while shocking and stressful in its temperature contrast, leaves the bather refreshed and with sensitive skin that lends to a feeling of sterility. Public baths work much the same way, through the scalding and cooling principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An empty storage room, indicative of Baron and Tzipora&amp;rsquo;s spartan minimalism, conceals a small personal laundry. A private laundry is considered luxurious in Vekllei, especially in urban areas where such things are easily communalised, but these apartment towers are new and these are among its benefits.
Finally, there is Baron&amp;rsquo;s bedroom and study. Like his daughter, he is a creature of routine, perfectly acclimatised to a home of any size. There is enough space here for a full-size electrotype and the books he needs to work from home on the occasions that permit it. Just beyond his door, in the living area, is a prayer table for their respective friends and family who have passed on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A “Horizon Wing” Atomic Passenger Jet</title>

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-12-09-wing/&#34;&gt;Click here for a view inside the wing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although  the CN-1 Horizon Wing passenger jet was not a “flying wing,” that  didn’t stop Comen Aeroyards, the manufacturer, from celebrating it as  such. Much like similar large-wing aircraft from McDonnell and de  Havilland, the CN-1’s large vertical stabilisers and obvious centre  fuselage precluded it from qualifying as an authentic “flying wing,”  which were already common in many air forces at this time. To argue the  etymology, however, is to miss the point entirely — the “flying wing” is  a style of flying, not a technical appraisement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei Overseas Airways (VOA), a subsidiary of the Vekllei Air Service, operates many types of aircraft for different markets. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/dyjdsn/air_stewards_in_vekllei/&#34;&gt;You can see their uniforms here&lt;/a&gt;.  Some of these are small and propeller-driven. Others are particularly  expensive and unusual — the astroplanes used to reach cities on the moon  are among the more fantastical. The CN-1 occupies a space between the  needle-like supersonic jet for business and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/e0xl3w/oceanliners_of_the_sky_vacuum_dirigibles_in/&#34;&gt;the large airship for leisure travel&lt;/a&gt;.  It allows the wandering family (or the comfort-conscious individual) to  make good time while retaining the liberty to eat, smoke, read and  wander comfortably about the aircraft. In the wings you’ll find a  canteen, a bar, a reading room, and sleeping cabins that can be booked  in advance. Because of these amenities, the CN-1 serves only  long-distance international routes originating from the Vekllei Global  Jetport, including to Los Angeles, Rio de Janeiro, Cairo, Moscow, Tokyo,  Shanghai, and Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power  plant aboard is a 6MW air-cooled molten salt reactor using an indirect  air-cycle system. The CN-1 is nicknamed “the hunchback” by mechanics for  its large air intake atop the main fuselage. The air-cycle system,  aided by sunburst-style radiators courtesy of General Reactor, limits  radioactive pollution in operation and does away with most of the heavy  shielding required by early nuclear passenger jets at the turn of the  21st century. Her large wing gives her tremendous lift and a smooth  glide, allowing low-power flight at cruising altitude for a quiet trip.  Although she is the first in a series of aircraft for the New Salmon  Design Bureau and Comen Aeroyards, she is largely adapted from the  XCn-series of military prototypes that have been languishing in  development for nearly a half-century. Though the design is sound, her  military applications are less certain, and so now the CN-1 flies folk  around the world peacefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  front-facing glass in the common areas lend to vistas never seen before  by the ordinary person. For a citizen of Vekllei, flying with VOA is as  simple as phoning ahead to reserve a seat. For those around the world,  your options for getting on the CN-1 are grim — Vekllei is a closed,  protectionist country and, save for a handful of CN-1s operating with  CAAC Airlines in China, your only option is to purchase a ticket to  Vekllei for an exorbitant price, which can run as high as US$10,000  today’s money for a one-way ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m working on a few more aircraft for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/&#34;&gt;r/vekllei&lt;/a&gt;’s SkyMonth. Let me know if you have any questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He kept bad hours. Sometimes he worked so hard he came home in the early morning and fell asleep to the television with the subtitles on. Like a guerrilla sighting a commanding officer, she would approach discreetly, wearing her blanket like a cape and bouncing on her toes. With a gentle movement she&amp;rsquo;d drape it over him and listen for a break in his snoring. If he didn&amp;rsquo;t stir, she&amp;rsquo;d find a nook in his shoulder and would stay there till the sunrays woke him in the morning. Those were her favourite nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone. Hobart here. We hit 1,000 subscribers only a month ago, and it gets a bit tedious to carry on thanking everyone, so I won’t. I’m not thanking the commenters who say nice things, and I’m definitely not thanking the lurkers who continue to validate my self-worth through subreddit metrics. It would be tiresome to mention that it really means a lot and I’m thankful, so I won’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve got a few updates to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new website looks really good. This doesn’t really affect anything on the subreddit aside from the fact it’s crippled my output this last week or two. It’s only in alpha, if anything, but once it’s polished it’ll be mesmerising. I really mean it. It’s so fun to play with already. It&amp;rsquo;s not like other project sites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SkyMonth will wrap up this December. It’s taken longer than planned, but so what? There’s lots of planes to come.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’d like to thank the handful of kind people who donate to my Patreon. I’m not much of a drinker, but I like a drop of Irish cream with my tea and coffee, and I’d have to choose between it and food if it weren’t for these nice people. I&amp;rsquo;m &amp;ldquo;between jobs,&amp;rdquo; so it really does make a difference. Thank you kindly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I reckon January will be a free-for-all in terms of posts. I might even pull back and do a really nice, time-intensive painting like I used to. Then we&amp;rsquo;ll go in for a deep-dive themed month (to be revealed).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comic is being written.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve gotten really nice feedback on a few of the character posts. Sorry if I didn’t reply — they were all written between 3-4am to get them over and done with, and I promptly disowned them when I woke up in the morning (might happen with this post too — it’s 3:26am on my clock). It’s easy to forget most of you don’t know the characters of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let me know. What kind of posts are your favourite? What’s working and what’s not working? Or you could just say a nice thing about me or my art, those do me just fine as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t conclude by thanking you for sticking with Vekllei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep tight, and see you in the morning,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(something about bed bugs biting)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inside VOA’s “Flying Wing” Atomic Passenger Jet</title>
      <link>https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-12-09-wing/</link>

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this limited cross-section of a CN-1 “Horizon” Wing&lt;/strong&gt;, the scale of the aircraft is immediately impressed upon the reader. It is nearly four times as wide as the older wide-body passenger jets of yesteryear, and twice as wide as most American and European supersonic jets. It is no coincidence that the “flying wing” concept was only made possible by the development of supersonic jetport infrastructure, with their wide and long runways, at the turn of the century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since their introduction, the flying wings have been exclusively a vehicle for leisure and tourism worldwide. The man of business takes a supersonic jet, which permits attendance of company business on two or even three continents in a single day. The wealthy family prefers the comfort and quiet of a large subsonic aircraft like the CN-1, which ensures a timely arrival without the cramped cabins of a fast aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And transport of the wealthy they are, for only rich cities can afford the land area and facilities of a jetport capable of hosting a flying wing. Jetports are a limited network linking the global elite: Los Angeles, New York, Vekllei, London, Paris, Moscow, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Sydney and Johannesburg, along with some others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei International Airways (later renamed Vekllei Overseas Airways, or VOA) flies 22 CN-1s, the first generation of the Vekllei flying wing. We’ll look at more technical details in the next post. 200 passengers can be aboard during flight, and it offers both sleeping cabins and row seating. In the cloudlounges abreast of the main fuselage are a bar and upscale canteen respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even minor adjustments to the aircraft’s bank are felt violently in the wingtips, and so passenger areas are concentrated near the aircraft’s centre fuselage. Nonetheless, the common areas are closed and passengers are returned to belted seats in the centre fuselage for landing, since adjustments made in flight can easily send passengers (and anything not tied down) into the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panoramic windows of the CN-1 lounges lend to dizzying views unlike any other on this Earth. It is comparable to visiting Moidonnest (Vekllei’s Moon City) and looking back at the Earth for the first time. It recalls the ocean liners of the late 19th century, but her boilers are atomic and her cabins are pressurised. Flying VOA is to enjoy flying as an act in itself; a further proclamation of Vekllei’s longstanding commitment to pleasure in infrastructure and common luxury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice coloured illustration of a person takes me an hour, tops. Let&amp;rsquo;s just say I vastly underestimated how long it takes to illustrate machines. After an Author update tomorrow, we&amp;rsquo;re going to look at the exterior of the CN-1 and then airline food! Then we&amp;rsquo;ll have a few more different aircraft, including supersonic, helijets, and military aircraft to wrap up SkyMonth. Let me know as always have you have any questions. It’s 4am here and I’ll get to them in the morning&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wallabies of the Arctic</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 days without posts feels like a century. Tomorrow, SkyMonth returns, and we’ll see what it’s like flying VAS. The day after tomorrow we’ll see an update for a few things — particularly a massive (and awesome) overhaul of the Vekllei site + wiki. Yeah, if you’re wondering where I’ve been, I’ve ditched Wordpress and have been learning HTML, which is like scraping the exposed brain against unpolished concrete. And after that there will be a lot more posts to follow to make up for the silence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Hobart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The rufous-bellied wallaby or &amp;ldquo;pademelon&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; is often mistaken for a kangaroo or even a rodent, but it is neither. These furry little lumps, known both for their rotundity and fecundity, do not share the dry and tropical temperament of their marsupial cousins throughout Australia and Indonesia, and are most at home in the wet, cold temperate rainforests of the quasiantarctic island of Tasmania. They also have a significant population in the least likely of places; a similarly cool, rainy, forested rock known as Vekllei (or Iceland, historically).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They grow like a radish and their ears rotate independently on the top of their heads, searching for noises that could eat them. They are an excellent meal for any predator, and are ill-equipped for the larger, invaded ecosystems to which they are extinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei, however, in its geographic and environmental isolation, has only a population of arctic foxes and some wolves to threaten them. The island&amp;rsquo;s biosecurity laws are among the strictist in the world, mostly to protect vulnerable birds (like puffins) and the biodiversity of their unique cattle, sheep, dogs and horses. There are entire brigades of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s armed forces dedicated to the culling of feral dogs and cats, and many species common to the rest of the world — rabbits and red foxes come to mind — are not found in Vekllei, which employs ruthless culling methods to contain them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were introduced intentionally to the Les Noisnosn agricultural belt (just north of Ro) in the early 2010s. Their import was a diplomatic effort between Australia and Vekllei as part of a wider series of gestures designed to reconcile tensions between the country and the British Commonwealth just prior to the First Atomic War. The introduced pademelons were very good at eating non-native grasses which had ravaged the temperate rainforests of the region, and were able to survive on the native mosses and plants once the infestation was dealt with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty years and an atomic war later, they have spread like wildfire. A healthy population exists across the entire island, and can occasionally even be seen in city parks. Their presence in the arctic, as an Australasian marsupial, is utterly unique. They are so common (and tasty) that there are no restrictions on their hunting, and are a staple of diets in and outside of the country’s urban areas. In smaller agricultural villages, like Tzipora’s Montre-Lola, they are hunted locally and prepared for eating in the traditional principles of Upen landcare. The meat is low in fat, mild, and sweet, and is often substituted for beef in Vekllei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are timid, docile creatures that sleep in the day and come out at dusk. Outside of cities, they are often kept as pets. Although Tzipora would never keep a pademelon, she would feed a dozen of her favourite regulars each night when they came out to chew on the mosses of her property. She also took part in fostering a joey which went on to live at the village post office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you have any questions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Making Trouble</title>

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora never lost her youthful curiosity. She would swish about the apartment, chasing an idea or plan that had occurred to her. Baron would look over and say “What are you doing, Zelda? Making trouble?” He said that a lot. He would come home in the afternoon and she would be writing lists, or organising her paperbacks, or moving furniture and he’d say, “What are you up to, Zelda? Making trouble?” She would say “No, I’m sending out invites for Christmas/learning the Dewey Decimal/going to have a nap in the sun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zelda had a way of attracting trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two deputies dragged the maid who worked at Motel Grande off Route 70 to a tree beyond the Kennecott salt flats. She was crying the whole time. She was very young for a maid, but girls needed money like anyone else. She was starving. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t the kind of hunger you saw in the National Geographic; it was a long, slow year of starvation, where most of her muscle had wasted away and she’d been left with a bit of youthful fat around her belly and cheeks. That&amp;rsquo;s just how people looked in Utah in 2063. Atomic power collided with indigence across most of the Southwest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This girl did not have a last name, because she was some immigrant worker with a fake visa worth less than her shitty hand-me-down rayon uniform. She knew what was coming in the back of the police cruiser and started to tremble uncontrollably as they left the highway. An immigrant expects what happens to immigrants. They pulled up by a stump and a small patch of dead ashes that were visible from the highway that crossed the flats. Would they take a picture of her for a postcard? She didn’t want that. Who would cut her down? Would they bury her? Suddenly the finality of it hit her — who, at all, would remember her?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was not sure if she was being made an example or an excuse, but could not recall for her life what she’d done to deserve either. The car engine ticked over as the bigger of the cops slung a thin noose around her neck and yanked on it until it hurt her throat. She pleaded with them in good English, trying to suppress her Latina vocalisations, and cried desperately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am American,” she whined, “I’m from California. Do I look Latina? Look, I’m white. My mother is from Germany. Please, you have the wrong person.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How old are you?” The big cop asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Eighteen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you start fuckin lying I’ll string you up now. Tell me how old you are.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m sixteen. Sixteen,” she coughed. “I&amp;rsquo;m just a late grower. My father’s from Salt Lake. Please, I’m not an immigrant. I was born here. I’m American.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Shut up; I don’t give a shit. You live with some girls in town, right? In that house?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In downtown Cherry, yes. Yes, I’ll tell you about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And you work for Mr Parker at the motel?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, I do. He’s nice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you pay union dues?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dues? No, I don’t think so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you pay any tax?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s all cash,” she blinked tears out of her eyes. “I don’t know much about taxes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All right, Griselda. We’re going to talk about some of the girls in that house.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They asked her some questions and took some notes. What she was doing only occurred to her after the third name. They gave her a sandwich to eat. It wasn’t out of kindness — it was to bask in the absolute violence of their authority. You could find as much pleasure in pardoning a girl as you could beating her. For a moment, on their command, her poverty and fear was excused. She chewed through bologna as she listed out her neighbours, and after a while her tears were for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she was almost done she began to wonder again if they’d kill her. She’d finished the sandwich and was unconsciously picking crumbs off her uniform, squishing her fingers pathetically against her lips as her eyes darted nervously between them. They left her there, with the noose around her neck, beneath the dead ash.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Medicating despair in the pasture of plenty</title>

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora is doing well now. She has looked into her heart and made peace with who she is. She has discovered she is a girl who likes free jazz, and milky coffee, and cotton shirts, and trains — to the surprise of no-one who knows her. She knows what things she values in a friend, and what deserves to become family. She knows what clothes she likes and how to do her hair. A year ago, she was a shivering little girl, but today she has become a glowing young woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A glowing pleasure though she may be, her nerves are still shot and her past is still with her. Tzipora is a habitual creature, prone to obsessions and addiction, and she’d suffered many vices by the time she met Baron. For a while it had been sleeping pills with the other girls in the Women’s House, chasing the mind-bending effects of a methaqualone high and sleep deprivation. It was about that time she picked up cigarettes, which helped with the tics she was cultivating in her violent poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She never quite kicked them. Like the tics, they stuck around. For a girl whose joy filled mountains and lows loomed cliffs, a cigarette now and then took some of that edge off. Ayn never liked her habit. Baron never asked her about it — he knew, she thought. He knew what it was like to feel the walls closing in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It made for some awkward encounters, not least of which was a moment of panic the first time Cobian stayed over. Zelda has always suffered very bad dreams most nights, and her fear of waking her friend led her out onto the frigid balcony in the early hours of the morning. Six drags in, the lights turned on and the door slid open. An awkward minute of fumbling followed, pushing Zelda into territory she was uncomfortable sharing with anyone but Baron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So it helps?” Cobian asked, mulling over the idea with her legs to her chest. Tzipora was fidgeting miserably in the cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where do you get them? The cigarettes?” She asked, as though Tzipora would mistake the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re Baron’s.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And what happens if you stop?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know,” Zelda sniffed. “You don’t have to make it a big deal, anyway. I don’t like this. I don’t like doing it, but what helps, helps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Can I try? I’ve never tried.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A moment later Tzipora laid a hand gently across the girl&amp;rsquo;s mouth to quiet the vicious coughing and hacking for fear it would wake Baron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Shh. It’s okay, I know it’s not good,” she soothed. Even as a genuine teen-ager Tzipora had been maternal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s terrible,” Cobian gasped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I know. But it helps. Let’s go inside, I’ll get you some water.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Tzipora would always operate according to the charter of her various obsessions, she was always slightly self-conscious about the cigarettes. Even sixty years later she only smoked alone. It was unbecoming of a satisfied person, she supposed, let alone a woman in the body of a girl. Still, for all her quirks and all her ticks, to most people her little vices were the most normal thing about her. She was a figure of contradictions, and her weaknesses were just as precious to her loved ones as her tremendous strength and bigness of heart.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ocean-liners of the Sky — Vacuum Dirigibles in Vekllei</title>

  Archived from the original article here
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry it took so long, mateys. I&amp;rsquo;ve been laying the first pages of the comic down and it&amp;rsquo;s like crack for me. Not much sleep and totally fell behind on SkyMonth. But, as any longtime members know, our Months are r/vekllei usually last a little longer than they should past their expiry date. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Angel and Memory of the People of Vekllei&lt;/em&gt; is the largest and most recent of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s airships. It’s usually just referred to as the &lt;em&gt;Angel of Vekllei&lt;/em&gt;, since transliteration of Vekllei hieroglyphs carry with them a lot of wordy semantic baggage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vekllei Air Service (Skyburo), the public bureau that operates the country’s commercial air fleet, also operates a dozen commercial airships of various size and capacity, colloquially referred to as ‘skyliners’. Where American skyliners are built as a luxurious alternative to the supersonic jet (although moving many thousands of times slower than one), Vekllei skyliners are similar to cruise ships, drifting lazily over continents and taking pleasure in the journey. Hilariously, the simple livery of the VAS aircraft is scaled up to absurd proportions on its airships, including the crowned circle on its keel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Angel&lt;/em&gt; exemplifies the spirit of the so-called Skyliner-mindset, since it serves a dual purpose; to carry five hundred Vekllei people across the world, and as a diplomatic vessel emphasising both the scientific achievement and peaceful intentions of the island country. For this reason, and unlike the rest of the Skyliner fleet, the dirigible only offers passage to Vekllei citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this end, it offers hundreds of passenger cabins across the middle of the ship, each with spectacular views. A grand ballroom sits beneath the fore, and the glittering crystal nosecap contains one of sixteen viewing galleries scattered about the ship. The indoor arcade and Vekllei stone-water gardens sits above the vacuum tanks, and spans nearly 250 metres in length. In the centre is a small heliport that can accommodate six helijets of a standard size. In the various glass constructions beneath the vessel you&amp;rsquo;ll find the Hall of Atomics, a library, smoking and reading rooms, and a cinema, among various other amenities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large geodesic vacuum tanks constructed of boron nitride ceramics support near-vacuums throughout the interior of the vessel. These tanks provide a maximum lift of nearly 6,000 tonnes, shedding the restrictive weight limits of yesteryear’s zeppelins for all the comforts of the modern age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei airships have extremely rigid tanks to support the creation of vacuums, which are controlled mechanically through valves. The infrastructure required to support the systems aboard is entirely electric, and powered primarily by a water-shielded atomic steam plant that powers two turbines. The primary reactor has a viewing gallery above it, where passengers can admire General Reactor’s triumph (A 16-megawatt HA5400 Series) without danger to themselves. An auxiliary reactor is positioned in the aft of the vessel in the machine room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After popular novelist Jacob Herdesnoisn&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Memories of the Sky&lt;/em&gt; recalled a summer aboard the &lt;em&gt;Angel&lt;/em&gt;, it is very popular for aspiring writers to apply for a job aboard, and use their generous days off to watch the entire world pass by from the window of their cabin, typing on an electric writer. Up to 15 per cent of its staff may be writers in the summer tour. The &lt;em&gt;Angel of Vekllei&lt;/em&gt; will usually pick up passengers at major airship terminals by lowering its inbuilt terminal to the ground, and return a few days later after touring the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very important to the Angel&amp;rsquo;s mission that it be seen by as many foreigners as possible. It might spend two or three days soaring above small towns and villages to impress upon the people there the quiet benevolence and love of science of the Vekllei people. A dirigible is quite unlike any other vessel to tour the skies today. It is luxurious and slow-moving; at once outmoded and unsurpassed. In an age of resource depletion and the race for efficiency, the vacuum dirigible is an incredible sight; a peaceful giant watching over the darkened cities of all the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Vekllei’s flag-carrying airline might appear just one of many in the small island country, don’t be fooled — all civilian aviation operates under a &lt;em&gt;venrouive&lt;/em&gt; bureau excitingly titled the Vekllei Air Service (Skyburo), which operates several distinct ‘airlines’ but wholly controls all of them. In Vekllei economic lexicon, a bureau is the largest trade union of an industry, made up of many hundreds of others, and is partially beholden to the direction of government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes the Skyburo a ‘public airline,’ but is not government owned in the way the rest of the world might understand it. Vekllei segregates business only along personal and public lines, with the political organs of the country largely segregated from daily affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illustrated here for your viewing pleasure are the largest of Vekllei’s ‘airlines,’ represented by their stewards in uniform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vekllei-air-service&#34;&gt;Vekllei Air Service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Vekllei Air Service&lt;/strong&gt; is Vekllei’s domestic airline, and operates within the country as well as to Vekllei’s semiautonomous Atlantic possessions like Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the Azores. The fleet are mostly twin or tri-engined nuclear jets. Vekllei has a comprehensive rail network, and the domestic VAS is mostly used to ferry people between Vekllei’s various islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-domestic-office&#34;&gt;The Domestic Office&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Domestic Office&lt;/strong&gt; is an unusual organisation largely responsible for unusual or unique aircraft that require specific training to command. These include sea planes, dirigible airships, helijets and so on. Their navy and white uniforms are remarkably simple, even spartan, and are the last remaining legacy of private commercial aviation in Vekllei’s pre-war years. There was not much money for uniforms then, and they carry on in this humble tradition today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vekllei-overseas-airways&#34;&gt;Vekllei Overseas Airways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vekllei Overseas Airways&lt;/strong&gt; is the international flag-carrier of the country, and compete with the likes of Pan-Am and BOAC. Their uniforms are the public face of Vekllei for many foreigners, and so they reflect both the dignity of the island nation and the high price required of foreigners for travel on the national carrier. It is customary to receive a bottle of Montre wine with a ticket. They also employ capes on male and female stewards, but they must be removed on the tarmac. They operate ‘flying wings’, large jets and a handful of airships called sky liners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-special-charter-service&#34;&gt;The Special Charter Service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Special Charter Service&lt;/strong&gt; is an unusual branch of the Skyburo, and is usually regarded as a government airline. Although civilian, it coordinates closely with Vekllei’s military and intelligence services to assist in moving personnel, and also would be responsible for evacuating Vekllei tourists in the event of an incident overseas or at home. Day-to-day, it operates only a few scheduled flights, with the bulk of its flight-hours spent operating charter services for bureaus and personal business alike. They wear uniforms styled after Vekllei cultural dress, which predates even the old regime and is a strong part of the national identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the r/Vekllei variety hour, where the tone between posts judders so inconsistently you&amp;rsquo;ll get whiplash of the mind. I was just drawing and thinking today. This is an author post, in case you haven&amp;rsquo;t noticed &amp;ndash; just a shitty blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, even today I&amp;rsquo;m wildly jealous of the success of those slice-of-life artists on reddit and Twitter. I still don&amp;rsquo;t understand the genre entirely, as a phenomenon. It&amp;rsquo;s usually male artists (at least in Japan), drawing distinctly Japanese neighbourhoods and landscapes, and situating a schoolgirl in the midst of it. They&amp;rsquo;re usually pretty amazing scenes. It&amp;rsquo;s almost always a schoolgirl, too &amp;ndash; in modern Tokyo uniform or セーラー服.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to figure it out. It&amp;rsquo;s obviously not sexual objectification, like so much elsewhere in Japanese illustration &amp;ndash; in fact, it&amp;rsquo;s usually nothing more than mundane or wistful scenes featuring some girl. But why is it always a girl? If it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to evoke a nostalgia for a childhood you&amp;rsquo;ve never had, why is it so rarely schoolboys? It&amp;rsquo;s surely to do with cuteness &amp;ndash; &amp;lsquo;cuteness&amp;rsquo; is almost always a female burden, and cute art is good, happy art. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any stats for this, but anecdotally most of the SOL artists I follow are men, and I reckon a large chunk of the audience for it is too. It&amp;rsquo;s boys creating cuteness for boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s interesting for me because Vekllei has a lot of similarities to slice-of-life art. I&amp;rsquo;m in the business of peddling nostalgia for places you&amp;rsquo;ve never been, and Tzipora is very much a girl who is very much in uniform a few days a week. It almost reads as satire, in fact &amp;ndash; Tzipora will never stop being a girl, since she is one of thirteen in the world to &amp;lsquo;not age,&amp;rsquo; as per her canon diagnosis. I don&amp;rsquo;t like to think that I&amp;rsquo;m carrying on in that tradition, or that I&amp;rsquo;m infantilising or deliberately cutifying these characters, but does intention matter at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure there&amp;rsquo;s anything wrong with it, anyway. It&amp;rsquo;s just that sometimes I look back through my catalogue, see its female/male ratio, and consider if I&amp;rsquo;m not just buying into the same kawaii currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a cute picture of Tzipora I made. &lt;a href=&#34;https://imgur.com/TiBF1xe&#34;&gt;I made a wallpaper of it&lt;/a&gt;, if you&amp;rsquo;d like it. Let me know what you think about the slice of life art crowd; I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ve got a decent overlap, aside from the cool bros here only for the hardcore geopolitik deprezzion posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve just pulled a body from an air force jet here that looks like General MacMillan, and we really need to know right now if it&amp;rsquo;s him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partially buried remains of a U.S. Air Force passenger aircraft are the only blemish on the horizon of central Greenland’s frigid snowscape. It is the site of one of the greatest political scandals in American history. The ancient landscape was violently disturbed in late December of 2068, when a Grumman Atomcat slammed into the ground, killing all 10 people on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Common Interest Watchhawk programme allowed a Soviet naval patrol to report the disappearance of a low-flying aircraft without a transponder. The bodies pulled from the wreckage some hours later would set in motion a panic among Vekllei’s intelligence agencies and a bloody purge in America’s south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei military intelligence units, who arrived at the site not long after the search began, battled irradiation from the aircraft’s reactor and freezing temperatures to confirm the origins of the mystery aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s him, all right. This is bad news.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An intelligence servant of the Vekllei Intelligence Americas Bureau (AB/NI) examined the brutalised face of the general. After a moment of consideration, perhaps to reassure himself of the identity of the cadaver, he ordered a suppression order over the site, which would enforce radio silence and conceal the disaster from the political organs of the Vekllei state for up to six hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacMillan had been distinguished in the U.S.A.F., but would have been an unremarkable soldier in history if it were not for the separatist movements of the Southern states in the late 21st century. The Marshal became Commander-in-Chief overnight, and quickly positioned himself as a lynchpin of negotiation between the separatist and federal governments. As a reasonable military man, he was trusted by the Federal committee, and was at the time of his demise negotiating the lend-lease of strategic nuclear sites that had been seized under the de facto splintering of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the lease, the United States Armed Forces would retain control of sites essential for ‘American continental security,’ but would withdraw sanctions against the separatist states first imposed under the Dallas Accords. So what the fuck was MacMillan doing mangled on a Greenland ice slope?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the dead was his mistress Olivia Scott-Madison and his two children, Daniel and Sofia MacMillan. His children were in nightclothes. Fighter jets were buzzing the Atlantic. It was clear something had gone terribly wrong in the hours prior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outside world would never learn the details of the MacMillan Incident, or its causes. What would follow, however, was the purge of many longtime associates of MacMillan from the military hierarchy of the Dallas Coalition states, and the immediate denunciation of the General and his political associates. AB/NI had long chased whispers of a coup against Dallas leadership in the months prior, and it appeared the perpetrator had arrived spectacularly closer to Vekllei’s gaze than anticipated. The bodies of the General, his family and his aides were flown to Vekllei, where they were identified and placed into archives. Both prime ministers of the country were informed, but were told that Vekllei would not need to worry about attempted American reclamation of the crash site or its occupants. Sure enough, neither the aircraft nor the bodies of its passengers were formally requested by the U.S. or the Dallas states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings of an investigation into the crash were inconclusive and quickly shelved. The aircraft was flying low, perhaps to avoid radar detection, so it was possible the pilots misjudged their altitude in the poor weather. Perhaps there had been an incident on board. There were no technical faults determined in the remains of the aircraft, which remains on that slope to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was known to the wider world was that the proceeding months would spark the bloodiest period of the ongoing American crisis, and the collapse of diplomatic relations between the separatist and federal governments. MacMillan and his family were the first of the vanguard separatists to die, but they were far from the last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the wonderful opportunity to work with one of our resident worldbuilders on reddit, u/EpicJM, and spend a while with their world and characters. The world of Eipljord has a lot of distinct, unique cultures and characters. As a sucker for uniforms I went with the garb of the Pruscyldan Academy of Magic, and you&amp;rsquo;ll find JM&amp;rsquo;s character, Honora being splattered with ice cream by Tzipora on the left and in Vekllei education uniform on the right. You can see the Vekllei racing jet from a previous post face off against Pruscyldan BlackJay behind her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JM&amp;rsquo;s got a very big world and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/jm_draws_stuff/&#34;&gt;very good instagram&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;d recommend checking out both. It&amp;rsquo;s not often I get the chance to work with nice volcanic islands and sandy beaches (nor Tzipora to visit them!) so thanks u/EpicJM for working with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hobart here. You might not know it, but I’m sort of a big fucking deal on the internet. No, don’t touch me. Why am I? Because my subreddit just hit 1,000 subscribers. What’s a subreddit? I’m actually laughing at you; imagine not knowing what reddit is. &lt;em&gt;You ingrate&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously though, this whole renewal of the project through a subreddit (rather than disconnected r/worldbuilding posts) has been an amazing thing. It gives me more wriggle room in what I can talk about, and — even better — allows me introduce you to my characters, who are very precious to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your State of the Subreddit bulletin follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’ll turn your attention to the badges on this post, I’ve scribbled up a few community awards for fun. They’re both 500 coins, the cheapest I can make it. They can’t give you premium. Reddit is garbage and they don’t really deserve your money, but some of the regulars here are pretty wonderful and if they ask a really good question or something you can reward them in a way you never could in Vekllei — with money. I made them so I can hand them out, really. You can choose from &amp;lsquo;Medal of Valour&amp;rsquo; for long-time service or &amp;lsquo;Great Question&amp;rsquo; for, uh, you can probably guess. Let me know what you think. Do I need more types?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For my new friends, of which there are many of you, it might take a while to settle into Vekllei’s world and characters. For example, Tzipora, pictured here abusing a friend, also goes by Zelda. If you get confused, you can check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/czi423/a_brief_introduction_to_vekllei/&#34;&gt;this meta intro to the project&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/czi423/a_brief_introduction_to_vekllei/&#34;&gt;this brief summary of Vekllei as a country&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve got a few different projects going, in addition to the regular posts. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/melonkony&#34;&gt;I’ve made a Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, since it’s literally a single button on my iPad to stream me working. This isn’t the start of some illustrious streaming career, just something that was easy to do. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.patreon.com/vekllei&#34;&gt;I also have a Patreon&lt;/a&gt;, if you’d like to send a few dollars my way for the posts or food or whatever else. On the horizon is the graphic novel (no two ways about it, it’s a long-term project but it’s coming), and a few special experiments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for hanging around. I’m very lucky to have a community that responds to my work. So many of you have reached out personally and interrogated my posts and it’s very flattering to attract that sort of interest. I’ll keep on keeping on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main beach in Mumen, the nicest of the seaside districts, is constructed out of sand imported from the dunes of Africa. Where the rest of the country has black sand, a symptom of its volcanic turbulence, Mumen has nice yellow sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baron doesn’t like the water, and getting him down to the sea at all was a trial. Zelda, for her part, sinks faster than lead in water and only ventures into the shallows with Ayn, who herself is afraid of the deeper ocean. She spends most of her time on the beach in her clothes, watching the other girls splash and compare suits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baron here is reading his paper, &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/cw44hm/sweat_and_ink_in_the_vekllei_news_agency/&#34;&gt;I wrote a bit about that organisation here&lt;/a&gt;. Zelda is reading a horror gazette. A naturally curious girl who enjoys newsreels and documentary, she swaps with him when they’re done. He claims he doesn’t like her horror gazettes, but he keeps taking them, and he keeps reading them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sunsets of Vekllei are nearly as legendary as the Aurora, and when the end of the day is at their backs it’s finally dark enough to face the sun and watch it settle. They take the tram home and finish reading in the warmth of their eighth-floor apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very difficult to obtain papers for tourism in Vekllei as an American, despite the fact that the Arctic island nation is positioned obstinately between the Americas and Europe. It’s not made difficult for any discernible political reason, either — relations with the U.S. are as good as they could be for a country like Vekllei. Nonetheless, tourism is regarded as a risk rather than an opportunity, and most Americans who visit for pleasure are wealthy enough to put up the sums of cash required to enter on the national carriers that exclusively operate in Vekllei’s airspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping out into the country for the first time is a hell of an experience. As an American you don’t really have a framework for understanding these people. They’re not European, or really Scandinavian. They don’t share many cultural or political bonds with the continental powers. And they’re not as easy to politicise or orientalise in the same way the folk of the USSR or Asia can be. They’re a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, work in Vekllei is social, and there are no real laws governing child labour. It is common to see children as young as twelve working as guides in the city’s largest jetport, Vekllei International, since work is basically a form of play. The dependence on Vekllei people for help (since a foreigner can only navigate society with the assistance of those that speak the language and understand the economy) essentially infantilises dignified, wealthy tourists otherwise not used to being looked down upon. This is further exaggerated by Vekllei’s complete absence of honourifics, lack of professional culture and suspicion of foreigners, meaning that even tourist infrastructure in the country regards Americans as a curiosity to be investigated and gawked at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These barriers to entry only further isolate the country from the outside world, in a position that is (in the late 2070s) totally unique. They are not quite &amp;lsquo;white&amp;rsquo;, not quite &amp;lsquo;religious&amp;rsquo;, not quite &amp;lsquo;Western&amp;rsquo; and not quite &amp;lsquo;communist&amp;rsquo;. Their iconography is nonsense; their language is spoken only by themselves, and their political motivations are as complex and built on intuition as they are incomprehensible to outsiders. Hence the scene above, where the new assistant to the ambassador and his wife are thumbed out of the terminal by a thirteen-year-old girl who speaks broken English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young worker pictured here carries only a radio for communicating with her colleagues and a pouch to fill with personal items, jelly beans or whatever takes her fancy. They work in shifts of usually a few hours each, which are coordinated with the larger nuclear monowing jets that land from the Americas around noon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Vekllei Timetable</title>

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s wind down Study Month with a look into the Vekllei curriculum. A few days ago I wrote about how Vekllei schools operate on fundamentally different assumptions about what it means to be ‘a child’. Let’s take a look at how that pans out in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most students study about 3-5 days a week, depending on the taste of the student and the work timetable of their parents. These days might occur sequentially or be scattered throughout the week, but most common is a Monday-Wednesday table table of four hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora, whose previous schooling was in a Catholic school in California, struggled to make sense of her timetable at first. The Vekllei curriculum very quickly depreciates courses outside of the interest of the student, and so staples of modern Western education — science, history, mathematics, language, were jumbled and in some cases dropped altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s break down her timetable, illustrated partially in English for your convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mathematics. Zelda struggles with even basic maths, and so she retains a course for her own wellbeing. Mandatory curriculum maths in Vekllei is mostly pragmatic and straightforward, and teaches theory as well as the basics of calculation and operations. More abstract maths like algebra and calculus are generally only taught in advanced classes designed to facilitate interest in those who show promise in it. Zelda is not one of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language. Zelda is an immigrant and at this point in her life speaks only primitive, conversational Vekllei. Because of this, she has three hours of class time a week but attends a special class for tutoring after school each day. She also makes use of her own time to study Vekllei logographs, called &lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt;. Baron is a good help because she can practice conversationally with him without the shame of mangling language in the real world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideology. Zelda for the first time in her life is beginning to engage with the world as a global network, and is quickly learning geography and flags to illustrate it in her mind. The Ideology class is concerned with worldview and how social structures influence it. It looks at traditional political ideologies as well as unconscious assumptions, and how those things affect policy and geopolitics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chemistry. Zelda likes chemistry and has good grades in it, and so she’s testing her ability in that area. Although she’s clearly developed an aptitude for the arts and language, she’s young enough to doubt her place and still enjoys experimenting with disciplines outside her expertise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sewing. Zelda likes sewing, and it helps her feel useful since she’s largely dependent on others for most other parts of her life. This class teaches young Vekllei people practical skills for maintaining clothes in the household. Next year, she plans to take on a more rigorous maintenance course to varnish wood and caulk windows, since it takes forever to get a contractor up to their apartment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Illustration. Zelda does not have enough of an ego to be intimidated by the skills of those around her, so she enjoys the class as a therapeutic outlet for her boundless creative impulses. She is trying to learn to draw portraits so she can do one of Baron for Christmas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Club time. Zelda belongs to the news club of Lola 7th School, and works on weekends as a photographer for the weekly newsletter. Her colleagues are polite and ambitious, and they appreciate her desire to learn. On school time she mostly meets with other members to help print the newsletter by hand on the old jobber press, and develop her photos in the school’s dark lab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Society. Zelda learns Vekllei history and values in this class, which helps explain everything from the intricacies of the Bureau System and Sundress Municipalism to more intimate notions of the proper way to wear a quarter-pleat and &lt;em&gt;semoisnesne&lt;/em&gt; (sun-facing attitude). It also helps contrast Vekllei’s system against the rest of the world, and more explicitly outlines Vekllei’s place in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Tzipora would have many troubles with school, none of them were ever related to her enthusiasm for her classes. Since she picked the ones that benefited her and had plenty of time off to explore the skills learned in them, she developed a healthy curiosity for her talents and it was reflected well in her grades. But, as most Vekllei students will tell you, they learn just as much growing up outside of school as they do inside the classroom. She would not have it any other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each year, a race is held amongst the most remarkable geological monuments of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s interior. Steep mountains forged in the restlessness of the European and American tectonic plates become deadly checkpoints in the world&amp;rsquo;s most high-stakes aeroplane race in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-speed, high-maneuverability jets (manufactured by the likes of General Reactor, V.K. Heavy Industries, and Kaleidoscope Aerospace) roar through narrow valleys in time trials that last only a few minutes. These jets are built differently from your standard light aerocraft, and feature heavily shielded reactors and cockpits (or, unusually, combustion engines), automatic ejection mechanisms, and a fuselage and wings designed to crumple upon impact. They are constructed first and foremost around high-velocity crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although a high-risk sport where fatalities are common, it remains popular in Europe and Vekllei. In the latter, the races are organised and subsidised by air racing orgs, usually clubs or pilot associations, and enthusiasts hike the otherworldly slopes of the valleys to watch racing jets compete for glory. In a world where seconds make the difference between failure and a world record, aerocrafts and pilots are pushed to their limits.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Schools in a Society Without Children</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about childhood and utopia. This post comes as we wind down Study Month in r/vekllei. Strap in kids, because this one gets kind of heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you get into the idea of it, “The Child” is a particularly unfortunate projection&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s not something most would agree with, but that’s how it’s worked out in the late 2070s. In fact, critical foundations of how foreigners view the world are not culturally neutral subjects as they might assume, timeless and naturally occurring, but are in fact symptoms of ideology. And despite the fact that there are children everywhere, The Child as an independent category of human being is a recent invention, informed by modernism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you visit Vekllei, and pay enough attention to the ordinary routines of the common Vekllei person, you too might be struck by the absence of The Child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the Montre-Lola-Yuman School, but is usually recalled as its district number: Montre 6th. Although modestly pretty, situated in a misty valley and constructed in the postwar demonewda style (a literal portmanteau of education, or &lt;em&gt;demolan&lt;/em&gt;, and Vekllei modernism, or &lt;em&gt;newda&lt;/em&gt;), it is the site of a remarkable clash between old and new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People live simpler lives here. Smaller lives, too, focused on pleasure and its pursuit. They have less to hide, and so less to hide from their own children. Here, a kid discovers a great deal about the basic premises of life and navigating relationships from watching their parents go about their work and conversations, and learn largely through play and interaction. Older siblings take on adult, independent roles within the family whilst the United States and Europe further complexify The Child into atomised subcategories; teen-agers, pre-teens, toddlers, and so on. In Vekllei, media and products designed for The Child are uncommon, as are clothes designed for Children, and so growth is informed through exploration and observation, rather than their age and year of schooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes are small but shift mountains culturally. It is not simply that children are “small adults,” or that they are ignored or not given affection, but that the grotesque commodification of childhood has been abolished with commodity itself. The very nature of childhood, then, is different from how foreigners understand The Child. In Vekllei, children mix freely between age groups, and do not subconsciously recognise stages of development in a matter of years. They attend the same school for the entire length of their mandatory schooling. Uniforms are universal and carry all the way through university. By their early teen-age years, the young Vekllei person is ready to carry out their place in paradise. This affords the youth of Vekllei dignity and responsibility, and forces a reconsideration of identity outside of the generic expectation of that age group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, modernism does not necessarily mean commoditisation — but they&amp;rsquo;re almost always found sleeping in the same bed. There is no scandal here. From the supermarkets of Utah to the villages of Uraguay, modern ideas of The Child and Interiority have warped the human brain unconsciously, rendering the whole world a meaningless scaffold of incestuous constructions — with a cultural history buried in copies of copies of copies. The way we understand landscape, the Self, our children, are all missing or altered in Vekllei, a modernist society without modernism. The rest of the world has been this way for centuries — and, most devastatingly, as soon as these constructions were &amp;lsquo;discovered,&amp;rsquo; their origins as constructions were suppressed. It seems to have always been this way, even though it was an invention that coincided more or less with the steam engine. The Child is no more inherent to “nature” (itself a construction) than a railway locomotive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, over the course of several centuries in the Western world, the child was discovered. Once it was found, an epistemological constellation had to be erected around it to make use of it. To write a story or paint a picture, The Child is projected. A child of America today will now wear clothes for children, play with toys for children and consume media built for that age group. You can expect a child to go through distinct phases, quantified numerically through their years of modern schooling. This carries on to poison the entire lens of childhood, and indeed, the subsumption of the outside world into this sort of culture and commodity is shocking to the Vekllei tourist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unusual fact makes Vekllei unique in the ideological landscape today, at once a pioneer of the arts and industry and a pre-industrial village, free from the ideological misery of modern life. The abolishment of industry, and the rising up of all people, has rendered the Vekllei people not classless, but a single enourmous class — an intellectual, educated class. What truly makes them unique, however, is how the “old ways” and “rural priority” are alive and well in the cities and apartments of the modern Vekllei person. That is utopia in Vekllei today, and that is what it means to grow up there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emotional Intelligence in the Epoch of Rest</title>

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about childhood and utopia. This post comes as we wind down Study Month in r/vekllei. Strap in kids, because this one gets kind of heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora and Cobian, pictured here, have very different stories but both have felt something was not quite right about them. That difference, so it would turn out, would blossom into a preference for women as partners, in the unusual desexualised way Vekllei goes about homosexuality in the late 2070s. To Cobian, who grew up in Vekllei, the realisation was fairly straightforward, although not without moments of anxiety and doubt. To Tzipora, who grew up in the United States, she found herself in crisis. She had previously held deep reservations about so-called ‘bolshevik lesbianism,’ only to discover a contradictory, immutable fact about herself. The canyon between their understandings of how relationships work reveals just how unique Vekllei is in the world today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of many pains of Vekllei’s growing material wealth was the economic unchaining of women from their husbands, and a shift towards solitude and independence for both men and women. For many, especially in the anxiety of the First Atomic War, lust became work, and marriages and birthrates fell quickly. As the poverty of post-war life developed into fledgling community-focused industry, so too did so-called “economic feminisation” (the abolishment of the male burden through the bureau system and work as pleasure) bring about changes in how women understood themselves in a society without commodity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These economic facts coincided with serious cultural seizures of anger and confusion at the collapse of old values and the bloodline-focused family, which culminated in a period of great population stagnation and cultural unrest without anything to fill the vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a move rare for Vekllei’s growing council-style democracy called Sundress Municipalism, a cultural movement was enacted at a national level. It was called something along the lines of a ‘sun-facing’ attitude, or &lt;em&gt;semoisnesne&lt;/em&gt;, in which free love, relationship pragmatism and most of all, familial independence were encouraged to foster baby-making and marriage happiness. Realistically, this cultural ambition was reinforced with several hundred social programmes designed to mitigate domestic violence, marriage breakdown and divorce. The restructuring of the post-war legal system, in conjunction with semoisnesne, had the unintended side-effect of decriminalising homosexuality, making Vekllei one of the few countries in the world to have done so. Normalisation was not a smooth experience, and social problems linger to this day, but is nonetheless utterly unique in the cultural landscape of the modern Western world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semoisnesne, like most cultural phenomena, has seen a downturn in popularity in the most recent generation of teen-agers and young adults, as part of a wider trend of emotional and sexual reticence in part as a reaction to the ostentatious displays of sexuality of the decades prior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, semoisnesne has made Vekllei a better country. It is now much easier to announce your preference for love in your own gender than it was previously, and that brings with it a whole shift in worldview — most crucially of normalisation, where such things are tolerated and visible in everyday society. Like many ambitious progressive projects, it has become a cultural pariah in recent years (teens today sarcastically refer to their attitude as &lt;em&gt;lumoisnesne&lt;/em&gt;, which better translates to good-facing [in the sense of a moral or ethical good]), but its marked impact on emotional intelligence and feminisation of the country has undeniably set Vekllei apart in a time dominated by fear and cultural retreat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a follow-up &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/dj5di0/uniform_ideology_in_the_arctic_north/&#34;&gt;to this post&lt;/a&gt;, as part of Vekllei’s “Study Week,” where we’re touring education and youth in the utopia of Vekllei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to their girls, who are adorned with many layers of clothing and dazzling patterns, the schoolboys of Vekllei are unadorned. Lace and quarter-pleats give way to bolder forms and masculine colours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much of Vekllei’s uniform ideology straddles complex (and often precipitous) schisms of modern and traditional clothing items, boys have received considerably more progressive attention than their sisters. They sport jackets of synthetic materials where girls favour wool and cotton, but do not enjoy the same modularity or flexibility in style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visible here are the standard armbands universal to Vekllei life, a male tie (although only male in an education context, and is often appropriated by rebellious young women), and a captain’s plate to distinguish certain older students as club leaders, which are integral parts of the Vekllei schooling experience. Clubs operate independently of the school and often assist students in honing their expertise for higher education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter, shown here on the right, had a game for a while where he’d surreptitiously point at his crotch, and when you looked he’d scold you for looking at his dick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for subscribing to this subreddit. I’m playing a game of chicken right now pitting my little Vekllei projects against my university work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei boys uniforms (and school architecture) is coming later this week, turning Study Week into a Study Month!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting from next week, several exciting projects are getting kicked into gear. One is the graphic novel. There’s also the Vekllei wiki, which is under construction. There will be a lot more art. And a secret, special project that’s gonna be &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; exciting. I can’t wait to share it with you all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.patreon.com/vekllei&#34;&gt;I have a Patreon now&lt;/a&gt; — not that you need to donate! It’s like a priority inbox. If you want me to print out illustrations and send them to you, see drafts of upcoming projects (like the graphic novel script and preview the special secret), or you want a little drawing of your own, sending me a dollar is a good way get my attention. It just goes towards server costs and keeping me from malnutrition, nothing exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there’s a lot on the way. I know most shouldn’t care, but I get nervous if I’m not here every other day or so. And lurkers, just so you know — Tzipora and I appreciate you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On with Study Month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The King and Tzipora do not get along. Zelda met him through Moise, when King managed the Domepent School’s cricket team. Moise was a pretty good wicket keeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King had offended Zelda with an off-hand comment on her youthful appearance, and she’d retorted with a remark about his weak blood circulation. Moise, caught between his new boss and his angry Zelda, navigated these stormy waters by ignoring the dispute entirely and separating them on the walk home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Moise would turn out to be a decent athlete, and she would spend more time around King, she never would come to like him. He was pompous without pomp. For his part, he regarded her as small and cranky. It was not an entirely unreasonable assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well isn’t this exciting! The talented u/Herald_of_Zena decided to draw Isabelle from his world in the uniforms I posted the other day. It was too much fun not to join in. It turned out to be a classic story told in two parts &amp;ndash; shit weather, put on coat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a pleasure seeing such a unique style that’s really one of a kind in the worldbuilding scene. It&amp;rsquo;s painterly and soft where a lot of worldbuilders favour a determined, blocky, concept art look. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/skyhornet&#34;&gt;Check out some other pieces on Isabelle while you’re here&lt;/a&gt; — she’s a really intriguing character with a stoic sort of disposition, not unlike our Zelda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s just so cool to see an item or outfit from my world appear in someone else’s style. Thanks a lot mate, it was a blast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone. In celebration of the approach of exams (at least in the Southern Hemisphere), we turn our gaze north to Vekllei to celebrate Study Week. Every other day we’ll be looking at education in Vekllei, and today we’re looking at uniforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life in Vekllei is filled with uniforms for work and in study, for a various historical and cultural reasons. In the late 21st century, in a society where work is social, they help distinguish and professionalise employment, which grants important psychological and social benefits. Where a uniform might be employed for economic reasons in a country of poverty, or as a form of social control in schools, in Vekllei they are identifiers and champions of labour in a workplace or school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the students of Vekllei, a single uniform is distributed across all ages of schooling, from preschool right through university and miscellaneous higher education. For girls, it is highly modular and incorporates important cultural items of clothing, like the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; quarter-pleat, &lt;strong&gt;temple&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;fountain&lt;/strong&gt; hairpieces, and overskirt lace aprons called &lt;strong&gt;sun petticoats&lt;/strong&gt; (in ceremony). Although Vekllei was once cold year-round, today it sees warm summers and mild winters that encourage distinct summer and winter fashions. A girl’s preference in uniforms may cycle through many styles over her schooling years, from spartan minimalism in high school (of just an armband, white shirt and red skirt) to decadent ceremony in her university years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vekllei Semaphore, the language of colour and shape, red and white imply both youth and energy (as well as sweetness, determinedness and purity depending on the context), and are often recognised as the national colours. In youth, it distinguishes education from traditional labour (in the literal, physical sense), which is communicated with navy blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-quality uniforms are a marker of national pride, as indicators of national wealth after the shameful poverty of the First Atomic War’s fallout. To the people of Vekllei, an intricate and expensive uniform distributed amongst ordinary people greatly influences the national ego, and further contributes to Vekllei’s social and cultural isolation from the rest of the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, we’ll be seeing how the boys compare. Then things will get a little more exciting.  Please let me know if you have any questions!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tattoos of Violence on Quiet Men</title>

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where tattoos had once been an indication of class and work, they were now uncommon. Both class and work had been abolished. Tattoos were almost never seen in the prism of ordinary Vekllei life, but in less savoury occupations they were found where utopian concessions collide with violence and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baron rolled up his sleeves and laid them out for her. You could accuse him of many things — he was a reticent bloke — but he was never dishonest with Tzipora. She was as much a companion as a daughter, and he treated her with the respect he’d afford any close colleague or friend. His upper arm was marked with faded illustrations from a previous chapter of life. Most obvious was a dragon that looked like it had been done professionally, or at least by a comrade who’d had some experience. It was intricate and artful. The rest were simple words or illustrations, maybe done by the man himself. Holding her tongue about the dragon tattoo, which demanded attention in its colour and scale, she asked about three dots that matched the patterns of her shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Those are for Amelie. I mentioned her, didn’t I? She was my sister — she would have liked you, too. She had a strange sense of humour.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They marked the grave of his sister who passed as a teen-ager from tuburculosis. It was a common outbreak in the poverty that followed the First Atomic War. She was fifteen — the Vekllei lifespan is measured in sets of five. Beneath it was a dagger, or improvised military cross, listing the initials of two friends of his and his years of service. “All done,” he told her, “while black-out drunk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She asked about his friends, and where they were, and he told her he didn’t know. “It’s true. That’s how service overseas goes sometimes. Look how long it took for me to get back here. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recognise them.” He paused for a moment, and raised his eyebrows. “Most likely, they’re dead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the Chinese dragon, illustrated cleanly with improvised equipment, lay a history of sweltering heat and combat. This one was a soldier’s tattoo, proud and impossible to ignore. You don’t give much thought to scarring your skin if you’re about to die. She did not know how long he was there, or in what capacity, because he did not talk about his time in the army. She just knew he was young — maybe a few years older than her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She liked his tattoos. For the thirty years she would know him, he was outwardly a quiet and thoroughly unextraordinary man. He took part in no great pleasures except a glass of wine on Friday evenings and a movie with Zelda on Sunday. Not once did he ever raise his voice at her. He smoked occasionally, and a pipe on weekends. But when he rolled up his sleeves after supper to smoke his pipe, and watch the evening from their eighth-floor balcony, the snake climbing the dagger was visible on his forearm. And behind that dagger, and that snake, there was a filthy room in Ariquemes, and a baby’s cry, and blood. A sinister revelation settled on the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Zelda would once explain, you might go to a friend’s party or parent-teacher, and all the other dads would see hers and think he looked like a professor or bank teller. She liked to think they gave no regard to him at all — he looked like a quiet, pleasant, nothing-person. But if he reaches for his left sleeve and rolls it up, that all changes. He reveals himself to be a figure of death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not uncommon for gangs to form in Vekllei, especially among immigrant communities otherwise marginalised by a complex logographic language and rigid belief system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, in a country of plenty, there is not much to otherwise identify with. Class is irrelevant in utopia, and the basic ideas of manhood and womanhood are being destroyed in hand with the abolishment of industry. Racial identifiers certainly exist — the population is descended almost entirely from Scandinavian settlers (with notably fair hair) and those of mixed Inuit-Scandinavian ancestry, whom carry Caucasian features but have dark, often black, hair. There are also many Vekllei of immigrant heritage, largely from Eastern and Southern Europe after the First Atomic War. It is along these racial lines that bullying occurs in schools and atomised communities form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Montre, a university city of Northern Vekllei, it is not uncommon for these prejudices to fester. The capital may be cosmopolitan, but cities like Montre and Adouisneh are largely homogenous. Decades on from the First Atomic War, arguments between native Vekllei and children of Greek heritage continue to play out, usually in stupid and meaningless ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cast against the racialised violence of the U.S. in the 2070s, and the Apartheid regime in South Africa, Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s ethnic tensions would be incomprehensible. On the small, arctic island, however, they will slowly be buried as generations cycle on and the pleasures of common Vekllei life realise themselves. There is no room in Vekllei for anything but Vekllei ambitions, regardless of heritage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pachinki is the fantastical notebook of Tzipora, in all her loneliness and thunderous imagination, shared with you all to enjoy. She&amp;rsquo;s so far constructed Pachinki posts about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/ar8jov/a_gem_girl_shows_off_her_enormous_strength_in/&#34;&gt;gem children&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/user/MelonKony/comments/azmu94/the_palace_gods_attempt_to_retrieve_their_runaway/&#34;&gt;palace henchmen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/b7n1uh/a_mineral_lake_starts_absorbing_grief_in_pachinki/&#34;&gt;sinister earth magics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/ba3mb4/the_littlest_goddess_in_pachinki/&#34;&gt;the Palace Gods&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/cudfnv/the_teeth_regents/&#34;&gt;teeth regents.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Tzipora’s notebook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[A Guide to Magic, Chapter 2: The Witch]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The witches of Pachinki are an interesting affair — many books have been dedicated to their research after discovery, yet so little is known about them. They are almost universally misandrists, which is understandable considering their present illegality and persecution in the subcontinents of Zen and Domos. They serve only themselves and individuals they happen to like, and spend most of their lives exploring the canyon between the chaos of nature’s fundamental frequencies and the power of human magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are rumoured to be able to split their own minds. Using old spells long since lost to ordinary people in Zen, they are able to siphon their mental faculties into a trusted object — usually a precious gem, and relegate essential functions of the brain to it. For example, a witch might siphon a tenth of her mental ability into a necklace, which then pushes out whatever consciousness exists within then carries on a witch’s essential functions — respiration, blood circulation and pain are just a few of unconscious functions a witch might do away with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would they do such a thing? Well, it is known to all people who have ever attempted magics that powerful spells force great stress on the mind. In fact, the more thorough the subsumption of the mind towards the spell, the better the results. By dispensing with her bodily functions, a witch is able to dedicate almost all of her mental power towards the task at hand, and since a brain operating without vital functions is a very stressed brain indeed, she can become extraordinarily powerful as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such magical efforts make perfect sense for people of power — government workers, or traditional sorcerers — but witches are far more interested exploration and discovery than they are power and conquest. So again — why would they do such a thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only recently has a possible answer to this question arisen. It is disarmingly straightforward — witches are outcasts, and usually very lonely people. By siphoning enough of their own mind into a creature or pet, they replace the pet with a functioning copy of themselves. They are consequently able to make friends at will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a process is incredibly dangerous — although only a fraction of brainpower is required to make a functioning consciousness, they are in essence duplicating a human mind. To transplant a consciousness of human intuition into, say, a raven, requires powerful psychophysical drugs and gems of a correct frequency to stop a collapse of the mind (and subsequently render ten percent or so of the witch’s brain ability permanently nonfunctioning). Even upon a successful schism, her summoned consciousness is hardly a raven — it is an anthropomorphic creature, of human mind and animal body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another fact of the witch, which may interest the reader, is that they do not decompose upon death. They are ordinary people in life, but ancient magic the likes of which is unobservable and unknowable keeps their body, intact or otherwise, totally preserved (though thoroughly dead). In kingdoms where witchcraft is a crime, you can find “witch towers” filled with the fresh, undead body parts of executed witches that will long outlive the grisly silos themselves…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello, everyone. It&amp;rsquo;s been six days. I&amp;rsquo;d like to have been here sooner, but I had the good fortune to leave my Apple Pencil in a hotel room in Sydney. Although delighted with my welcome and surprising expense (~$150AUD, or roughly 43 bacon and cheese pull-apart loaves), I&amp;rsquo;ve consequently fallen behind with my off-daily illustrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I carry the ANZAC spirit deep within me, and I&amp;rsquo;ve made use of my time. I have a document, many thousands of words long, detailing a special kind of script. &lt;a href=&#34;https://imgur.com/lL3T32R&#34;&gt;The writing is excellent.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll give you a hint &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s not for a film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for sticking with me. I&amp;rsquo;m back. In the meantime, please enjoy this illustration and story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Moise arrived at the Desmoisnes&#39; to pick up Tzipora for the halloween festivities, he was greeted at the door by Baron, who looked tired and held a powder mirror in one hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, hello, Moise,&amp;rdquo; Baron said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How&amp;rsquo;s things?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Good, good. Say, Moise, could you tell Zelda she looks nice when you see her?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Moise could ask, Zelda&amp;rsquo;s voice rang out from behind her father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tell him I&amp;rsquo;ll be a moment! Just a moment!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; like most Zeldaic exclamations, there was panic in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later, he stepped inside her room to see her. She was dressed as a witch, and wore a cardboard hat fashioned in black linen on her head. Most immediately, however, he noticed she was wearing eye-liner and rouge. He&amp;rsquo;d never seen her wear make-up before, because she looked too young to wear it. She was a teen-ager whose appearance made such feminine gestures a costume rather than daily practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You look really nice,&amp;rdquo; Moise said. &amp;ldquo;Have you done yer face?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes,&amp;rdquo; she beamed, &amp;ldquo;you noticed! It&amp;rsquo;s not done poorly is it? I&amp;rsquo;ve got no practice.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nah, it looks great.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wasn&amp;rsquo;t lying. She&amp;rsquo;d gone a bit heavy since her lashes were so dark already, but she looked years older for it. Zelda wilted under any timid flattery and smiled genuinely at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Maybe I should wear it sometimes. It&amp;rsquo;s not too much trouble.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baron called from the living room: &amp;ldquo;It took &lt;em&gt;two hours&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;All right!&amp;rdquo; she yelled, and after a moments of pause, followed with a kinder shout. &amp;ldquo;Thanks for helping me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The festival went until the early hours of the morning. Cold city air washed over them in waves as they passed through warm clouds of woodsmoke from fires set out for hallow&amp;rsquo;s eve. He was dressed in pinstripes as a Mafia don. He told her he had Mafia blood in him. Zelda asked if he was getting Greece confused with Italy, to which he took great offence. She started laughing as his fake moustache danced about on his upper lip when he corrected her, which made him more annoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a nice night out, in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome again to MoonMonth! It started a week ago and will go until I’ve said all I can say. We’re looking at how Vekllei conquered the moon today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei unequivocally won the space race. Not because it had the first man in space — the Soviets succeeded in that. Nor were they the first to the moon — the Americans had been there for nearly a century. But Vekllei was the first to establish permanent habitation of the Moon’s southern pole, and its claims of territory were reluctantly accepted in the early 2070s after nearly a decade of heated diplomacy. Although the value of the Southern Pole had been known for some time, it was Vekllei that leapfrogged the world’s largest powers to secure the moon’s most valuable real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Vekllei’s Mt Io, which the rest of the world knows as the Malapert Massif, Vekllei’s largest city enjoys more sunlight year-round than the arctic home country, and parts of the Copette Basin (Shackleton Basin in English) have peaks of eternal light. It enjoys uninterrupted microwave visibility to the Earth. A thick smooth regolith has supported a permanent, concrete settlement and landing areas. It also sits adjacent to regions of permanent shade, which are home to valuable gasses and water which supply Vekllei’s spacecraft with fuel, and assist in fusion research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vekllei Moon Zone has expanded several times in the thirty years of its existence. At first it claimed only a few hundred square kilometres around Mt Io, but has since come to dominate much of the territory around the moon’s Southern Pole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, it is a thriving colony of invaluable economic and psychological importance to the city-state back home. It includes Moidonnet, a city of 50,000 people with all the luxuries of home — plus a few more, like biome domes and zero-gravity museums. Traismodonnet is a military city in the Aitkin Basin that houses much of Vekllei’s classified research into fusion technology. An enormous cosmodrome sits in the Huay Crater (named after Vekllei’s largest cosmodrome on Earth), supported by a military landing site a few hundred kilometres away in the Schrödinger Crater. Prohibited zones litter the Vekllei Moon Zone, including areas allocated for hydrogen and water extraction (such as the SPA Basin Mining Zone, the largest of its kind on the moon) and the Aero Prohibited Area, which extraterrestrial landing craft and weapons in view of the disputed territories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valuable real estate is scarce on the moon, especially when costs for travel and infrastructure remain so high. The moon is rife with claims and counter-claims, which often escalate into border skirmishes. These claims sit alongside vast unclaimed territories, largely on the far side of the moon. Any claim made on this vast Terra Nullius will trigger a reaction of counter-claims, and escalate a declining world further into conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the moon today. A place of military espionage and tremendous scientific advancement, largely distributed between a handful of superpowers and Vekllei’s jewel in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MoonMonth will return tomorrow. As an interlude&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Winter 2064, the changes made to the constitution of the &lt;strong&gt;Boy Scouts of America&lt;/strong&gt; (BSA) would be felt around the scouting world. By this point it was pretty clear that the globe had entered a “helter skelter” decline towards tragedy. The emerging fission technologies were too slow and expensive to mass produce, and the fossil fuels that lighted homes around the world were starting to run dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t just a crisis of resources — there had been Taiwan, and the Commonwealth Wars, and the disaster of decolonisation. There was a long history of decline, paved in blood, and it was pretty clear that things were going to get worse before they got better. If they got better at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Winter 2064, several clauses were introduced into BSA recruitment that would reposition the organisation as a fundamentally patriotic youth org, and would seek to raise a generation of the kinds of boys and girls America would need in the coming decades. They would have to be resourceful, capable and most of all, dutiful adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese-born children were thereafter denied entry altogether, and those of immigrant heritage would be subject to allegiance testing. Over the course of a week and several indiscreet searches of the family political history, the BSA recruitment board would weed out communists and suspected agitators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an organisation of the prestige and heritage of the BSA to implement overt racial vetting meant that political repression was normalised — so-called “national orthodoxy” — in youth orgs around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vekllei the largest youth organisations include&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The National Blossoms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Puffin Scouts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Landscape Bureau&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;National Blossoms&lt;/strong&gt; concern themselves largely with traditional landcare and stewardship of national parks, and the &lt;strong&gt;Puffin Scouts&lt;/strong&gt; are focussed on camping and friendship. The &lt;strong&gt;Landscape Bureau&lt;/strong&gt; includes people of all ages, not just youth, and form part of Vekllei’s Parks and Heritage organisation (in which careers can be forged).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the constitutional reforms of the BSA, and subsequent militarisation of many European scouting organisations (as well as several so-called Western pockets of Asia), had little obvious effect on Vekllei’s youth orgs, subtle changes were made to better distinguish her domestic scouts from the rise of child fascism across the world. Parts of the uniform were demilitarised, and girls were allowed to wear skirts for the first time. The colours of the Puffin Scouts shifted from red and white, which is associated with the country as an identity, to gold and green, which better translate to “wilderness” in Vekllei Semaphore. The political curriculum of the youth orgs (covering Upen, the Bureau System and the modern Vekllei city-state) was shifted to eighteen and above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a scary time to be alive, but the children of Vekllei’s youth orgs are largely unaware of it outside of nuclear drills. Young scouts — ranked as Pufflings in the Puffin Scouts — spend their childhood years learning to tie knots and make friends, where the children of America are learning to shoot a rifle and memorise the dual constitutions; that of the Boy Scouts, and that of America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the picture above, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice a guide to decoding a simple Vekllei &lt;em&gt;Gi&lt;/em&gt;, a type of ceremonial quarter-pleat, and a collection of items a Puffin Scout is likely to have on their person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much everyone. It&amp;rsquo;s very exciting for me. I ordered a cake from Banjos to celebrate but Tzipora got it all over the floor and herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for subscribing. I&amp;rsquo;ve been pushing myself a bit too hard and my writing&amp;rsquo;s suffered for it. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I can slow down, I&amp;rsquo;m just not that kind of guy, but I want to promise some exciting adventures in the future as we hang out with Zelda and her loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s to a thousand! My goal is to get bigger than the main worldbuilding subreddit. Only a few hundred thousand to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, feel free to stick around, enjoy the party, scrape whatever cake you can off the floor and have a good time with Zelda and me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome again to MoonMonth! It started four days ago and will go until I’ve said all I can say. We’re looking at the space industry in Vekllei. This is just a quick piece I&amp;rsquo;ve done between some larger things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Copette Science Basin&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;and Rocket Factory&lt;/strong&gt; launches sixteen rockets a day. Those rockets are packed with robotic mining equipment and are sent chasing asteroids floating through our solar system. The robots return sometime in the following year with an asteroid rich with metals in tow, where they are incinerated upon entry and many tonnes of metals are plunged into empty drop zones in the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Vekllei, a resource-poor island country with an insatiable demand for steel and uranium, extraterrestrial mining has allowed the country to fund projects of great national pride. These include the moon tourism programme, the Faroe military bases, and large atomic airships for work and pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Copette Basin is a mountainous region far enough from Copette proper to launch rockets regularly. The flower-tundras that frame them are caught at once between the incomprehensibly ancient tectonic landscape and these visions of tomorrow. Old and new; agriculture and futurism — these are marks of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s schizoid relationship with the present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to MoonMonth, which started two days ago and will go until I’ve said all I can say. These posts are going to work a little differently — we’re going to follow Tzipora through her adventures in Moon City and beyond, and learn about the moon in this world along the way. Strap in!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei has put a great deal of effort into developing infrastructure for tourism across the lunar surface of the Vekllei Moon Zone. For no cost except their labour in society, a Vekllei person is able to enjoy a handful of activities in Moidonnet (“Moon City”), the largest and most recreational of the moon colonies. It is a complex of about a hundred connected buildings at the base of Mt Io, far away from the border territories of the Vekllei Moon Zone. On her 18th birthday, for which she still looked fourteen, Tzipora was gifted a week-long holiday in Moidonnet with her father, Baron, who surprised her with tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora had never got to grips with flying. She was uneasy around most things too big for her immediate comprehension. The sky and the sea and space might be grand, but she was a small girl of a provincial disposition and was satisfied with a pocket of land and some people to talk to. She had taken pills for the flight to the moon, which climbed steeply and enjoyed several hours of zero gravity, but had calmed down by the time she’d acclimatised to the novelty of life in Moidonnet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was now in a room fretting over the equipment that would separate her person from millions of miles of empty vacuum. Around her was a pink preparation room with padded walls, typical of the confined spaces of Moon City. In this gravity it only took a stumble to send you careening into the air, and the cushioning would prevent you from cracking your head open. Along the walls were metal railings available to seize in the event you lose your balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The City was distinctive in its shoelessness, as it was easy to float in the low gravity of the moon and kick things that should not be kicked. It made the whole place feel quite scientific and homely at the same time — like all tourists here were fellow travellers in some great expedition, too familial to bother with formalities like shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A heavy atmospheric suit was suspended by its lifelines to the roof. It was bulky and had strange shiny booties at the feet. Nearby were moon boots, which would be sealed along with the rest of the suit in a vacuum cocoon before test depressurisation in the airlock. The International Standard flag was hung on the wall, probably to impress foreign tourists. There were a handful of foreign tourists visiting, usually relatives of Vekllei citizens. Occasionally you saw obviously wealthy foreigners who’d payed their own way. They were easy to spot, for their gold rings and nice clothes looked absurd and tacky in the face of the glory of Vekllei infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no appetite for skirts in Moon City. The risks were too great. She’d changed out of trousers into a stiff jumpsuit bleached white with cleaning chemicals. Now that the domestic conventions of getting changed had been completed successfully, the weight of her adventure finally dawned on her. She took a seat and looked between the helmet and the body of the atmospheric suit, and felt her stomach drop. All of a sudden she missed Baron very dearly. Where had he got to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time, we’ll look at rockets. See you soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caption: “So — Mr Spaceman… How long have you held a job at Vekllei National Astrospace? 37 years?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most Vekllei people, Tzipora has visited the moon. From Ground Control on Earth in the district of Huay, Vekllei operates many moonbases, domes, research facilities and tourist opportunities in the moon’s southern hemisphere within a large complex called Moidonnet — Moon City. It sits a hundred kilometres south of Mt Io (called Malapert Mountain in the West) in the Vekllei Moon Zone. It receives shuttles several times throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time Zelda visited the moon was as a birthday gift from her father, who hadn’t been in many years. She recalls reading extensively about the moon in preparation for the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“… here’s hoping, then. So we’ve booked for three nights up in Moidonnet, and then a single night in Traismadonnet, a smaller city closer to the equator. I wanted us to do as many things as possible, so I think we should visit the peak of Io Mountain today, where they say they have a spectacular bio-dome and you can see forever, and maybe go on a space-walk. We’ll see. Spacewalks are hard to book ahead for, but if we get tired we can just do everything else the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s also an art gallery built for low gravity. It’s amazing, like a rubber castle, filled with sculpture and room pieces that are — well, they’re just amazing. You’re always telling me I’m too skinny. Guess how much I’ll weigh on the moon?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Twenty kilos?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just under ten,” she smiled, and then laughed at the idea. “You could pick me up and throw me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the rest of September I’ll be looking at Vekllei space tourism. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to cover, so stay tuned!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only had time for a quick painting tonight. Bigger things soon, after I get some things out of the way&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expo’74 was the 2074 World’s Fair, hosted in Vekllei for the first time in nearly a century. The country had made tremendous progress in recovery from the First Atomic War, and set to work nearly a decade in advance of the Expo to create a palatial fairgrounds between the districts of the Capital and Ro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The centrepiece of which was a triumph of Newda design and Vekllei civic construction: the Number 7 Plant, or Peace Reactor, which was the first commissioned molten-salt fission reactor of its type in the country to produce power. The main reactor structure is located within a pure unblemished sphere above a grand public hall and museum detailing Vekllei’s long history with nuclear power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it does not produce as much power as the country’s larger plants at 1,020 megawatts, and is frequently shut down for experiments, it is uniquely situated upon a hill in the centre of the city and is visible from almost all parts of the capital area. It is a physical testament to prosperity itself, and its public grounds are a popular attraction for locals and visitors alike.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introducing Ayn</title>

&lt;p&gt;The daughter of a Soviet expat and Hong Konger deckhand, &lt;strong&gt;Ayn&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Rumouisen&lt;/strong&gt; has never stepped foot outside of Vekllei. A serious fear of flying and the open ocean has hedged her appetite for travel for all of her thirty-two years. She is well respected as an operations consultant within the Americas Bureau at National Intelligence (AB/NI), and is close with the ABNI Operations Director &lt;strong&gt;Baron Desmoisnes&lt;/strong&gt; and Vekllei’s first “Gregori Baby,” &lt;strong&gt;Tzipora &amp;ldquo;Zelda&amp;rdquo; Desmoisnes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s known Baron, Tzipora’s father, for nigh twenty years. They met when she was eighteen, both as cadets in Vekllei’s combat intelligence programme. They dated for a few years before the requirements of intelligence work forced them apart. Baron was sent to South America for nearly a decade, and Ayn stayed behind in the Monitoring &amp;amp; Preparations Department where she published work in the classified journals about events relevant to ABNI. She was also an associate contributor to the “Import Strangle” theoretical model, which has proven successful at plotting the collapse of major U.S. employers (like U.S. Steel in 2065 and Chrysler in 2068) for use in Vekllei foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baron and Ayn exemplify quiet, uncinematic mateship — people satiated by occasional company and mutual respect, satisfied by their intermittent time together. After Tzipora’s adoption, Baron, now approaching his forties, returned to work as a senior director for the Americas Bureau, and soon found himself in Ayn’s professional orbit. In doing so, he introduced a nervous young satellite called Tzipora to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora adores Ayn. Ayn is everything Tzipora wants to be. She is even-tempered but strong-willed, graceful but not girlish, fiercely intelligent but pleasantly social. Where Baron is a product of his years in America and is totally professionalised at home and at work, Ayn has enjoyed life in Vekllei and is well-rounded and sweet. It was a shock for Tzipora to see Baron and Ayn in a photograph from their cadetship. Baron straddled a motorcycle, and did not wear spectacles. He was well-built and rough-looking. Ayn was a slender Asian woman dressed in slacks and a sunhat. Ayn today looked very much similar. Baron, in his beard and white-speckled hair, looked like an entirely different person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora and Ayn share a hardship in their infertility despite a desire to have children — Ayn suffered from endometriosis for many decades and is incapable of pregnancy. In all ways, Baron’s reluctant decision to adopt Tzipora was a wonderful blessing — it brought old friends closer together and gave Ayn a daughter. For Tzipora, whose memories of her biological mother were bittersweet and muddied with time, Ayn was a breath of womanhood and light-heartedness in a household that contained only a single hard-working middle-aged man and his teen-age daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Baron’s immediate family is dead, Tzipora is close with Ayn’s parents in the North of Vekllei and they’ve taken to her as a granddaughter. Although Ayn and Baron are not married, and may never marry (although Tzipora gauges his response at least once a year), their lives are so thoroughly entwined that it is not uncommon that Baron will return home to Ayn and Tzipora preparing dinner together. In fact, Ayn is the reason Tzipora is such a good cook. Love takes many forms, and Tzipora enjoys several of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Normal programming will resume presently. Thanks for your patience everyone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a research proposal due today, and since I&amp;rsquo;m pretending to still be a university student I suppose I&amp;rsquo;d better do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time thinking about what the hell I&amp;rsquo;m doing with my life, and after a while I get hungry. Banjos &amp;ndash; a very Australian name for a bakery chain &amp;ndash; satiates my existential hunger with two bacon and cheese pull-apart loaves for $10. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what that would be in American money. Probably like $6.80 or some bullshit because our exchange rate is absolutely not very fair dinkum at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose what I&amp;rsquo;m saying is I eat as lot of bread, and I appreciate you guys being here for it. I despise the idea of myself blogging but sometime I need an outlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a story about Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s consumption and disposal of soldiers through her foreign fighting force. You can read more about the Vekllei army in these old posts &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/chncjy/veklleis_elite_military_units_the_garden_corps/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/98trlw/allweather_combat_for_the_atomic_age/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Vekllei de ra Couismenan Desnepotet&lt;/strong&gt;, or the Vekllei Foreign Army, is an exclusively foreign fighting force employed by the National War Bureau. It accepts any person between the ages of 18 and 35. After five years or being wounded, the soldier is granted Vekllei citizenship, making the Foreign Army one of the only guaranteed ways to secure citizenship in the country. Many thousands apply each year, but only a few hundred are chosen to enter training. Out of those hundred, almost all recruits have previous military experience, and many have spent time in conflict zones as mercenaries or special forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Vekllei soldier is called a “Macker,” or “Macka,” which is Vekllei slang for a tool or implement (with origins most likely in the useless colonial wars of a century ago), and the fighters of the Foreign Army share this name. Macker slang is called Mackanese, and serves as a colourful argot that distinguishes military people from the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Army recruits are given a very different style of training to those at home. Where Vekllei people are egalitarian, laconic, and suspicious of authority, foreign recruits are taught to reverently serve the Army as an institution and maintain their status as elite soldiers. Vekllei has no qualms about allowing women to enlist in its special forces, and they are treated the same as male soldiers. Their numbers remain low among the Foreign Army population, but those that succeed are very skilled soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soldiers of the Foreign Army are stationed abroad, and command areas of Vekllei political or economic interest. Almost eighty percent are stationed in the so-called “quadrilateral of poverty,” which has corners in Hong Kong, Darwin, Johannesburg, and Casablanca. Within this shape you’ll find the interests of the world’s powers, pushed to the brink following the collapse of oil and an extraordinarily expensive arms race for over a century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While on a mission, unless food is acquired by other means, mackers eat pills. They carry three kind of pills: vitamin and performance-enhancing supplements (usually amphetamines), water disenfectants, and growables. Growables are capsules that, when mixed with water, solidify into a sort of paste that mackers call &amp;lsquo;remen soup,&amp;rsquo; after the male prime minister of Vekllei (Vekllei has both a male and female head of state). Although they come in several flavours, they invariably have the texture of cold, watery gruel and are never eaten outside of missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, all fighting folk of the Foreign Army carry &amp;ldquo;fucksticks,&amp;rdquo; a deliberately crude transliteration of &amp;ldquo;fox-sticks&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;explosive fox-hole diggers.” The firing end of a fuckstick is placed against asphalt, earth, or a wall, and after a short fuse it craters whatever is unfortunate enough to be on that end of it. In a grassy field, it will provide an emergency foxhole in otherwise flat earth. In an urban environment, it will allow entry through walls (and potentially bring the whole structure down). In the desert, it will produce a huge plume of sand that will obscure the soldier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most spectacular of the fighting man&amp;rsquo;s equipment, which otherwise distinguishes today&amp;rsquo;s equipment from that of yesteryear, is the jump-belt. Up to ten propellent canisters feed two jets that enable an ordinary person of mild athletic ability to perform superhuman jumps. They are not jet-packs; indeed, jet-packs are dangerous, specialised equipment rarely used for combat operations. Instead, a tug of a rip-cord will allow an unencumbered soldier to jump several meters, or cross a gap of up to 30 feet. While in development, the jump-belt was imagined to revolutionise infantry combat; it would allow troops to leap into second-story windows or leap across rooftops. Perhaps, it was even theorised, that someday we might do away with parachutes altogether and use belts to land instead. In reality, the jump-belt is mostly used to cross open roads or avenues, or to escape incoming fire. They are enormously unwieldy, and inexperienced troops will almost always lose their balance. In the right hands, however, they have seen success in the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National War Bureau is not a naive organisation. Outwardly the Foreign Army are foremost a declaration of power, in the child&amp;rsquo;s masculine fantasy most warlike forces rely so heavily upon; recruits are told that they are beyond good and evil; that they do what needs to be done; that they are a vanguard in the face of the forever war. The iconography and legend of the Foreign Army relies so heavily upon the masculine and the mercenary for the same reasons that the reshaping of a person’s identity is an essential part of the recruitment process &amp;ndash; to submerge a decent person into the raw language of power, and disguise the iconography of hero-worship from its praxis as a totenkopf. In a global climate where consumption has ravaged the national and spiritual identity outside of Vekllei, and force is normalised and glorified, the foreign army is legitimised and made innocent for their vast crimes across the poverty quadrilateral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They carry on, doing “what needs to be done”. It is only once they are broken and emptied by five years of indiscriminate violence, for undeclared reasons in an undeclared war, that they are shipped into Vekllei and find themselves too broken to assimilate into domestic society. So they reenlist; they are the eternal soldiers of a forever-war.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tesmosnen, the Festival of Fasting</title>
      <link>https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-09-07-festival/</link>

&lt;a  href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/vekllei/comments/d0voc0/tesmosnen_the_festival_of_fasting/&#34;   target=&#34;_blank&#34;  class=&#34;book-btn&#34;&gt;
  Archived from the original article here
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the quaint ocean country of Vekllei, during their years of fecundity and fun, the calendar is divided into twelve festivals of various celebration and purpose. They include the &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2020-06-01-fission/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Festival of the Sea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in October, which celebrates Vekllei’s vast fishing navy and concludes with the detonation of a nuclear weapon off Vekllei’s coast, to the &lt;strong&gt;Festival of the Moon&lt;/strong&gt; in January, which is quiet and acknowledged only through personal ceremony and decorations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important festivals in the country’s animistic spiritualism, called Upen, is the Festival of Fasting. It is not a traditional fast — you are permitted to eat as much as you like. Instead, the Tesmosnen festival asks participants to either reject meat or hunt it for the duration of the festival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although by no means mandatory, during January you’ll begin to notice restaurants alter their menus and youth organisations train to hunt during the festival weeks. There is an important cultural reason that usurps the largely spiritual origins of the festival — fasting or killing forces you to acknowledge, as a consumer, the cycles of production and consumption at a most basic level. In Vekllei, which seeks a return to preindustrial lifestyles, modernisation largely abolishes the previously intimate relationship a common person had with agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a mountainous island country, Vekllei must import the majority of its red meat, and shortages are common in rural areas. Although polls show that Vekllei prefers fish as its meat of choice, it is undeniable that consumption of red meat has increased tenfold over the last few decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the three weeks of the festival, Vekllei people, including older children, are encouraged to fish or hunt as personal recreation or through environmental organisations. The act of killing and cleaning better illustrates the servile relationship the Earth now has with voracious human appetite, and this relationship forms in part the total Upen worldview.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Most Complex Machine, the Autokinotheodolite</title>

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, I drew this a little while back after getting back from Woomera, South Australia. Woomera&amp;rsquo;s a closed government town that tests missiles. Not my finest illustration, but it is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep in the mountains around Montre, above a tangle of submerged forts and ballistic missile silos, there sits a Vekllei Rocketry Corps test facility called the Strawberry Site. From the peaks of the surrounding mountains, should you evade the helicopter patrols and dog teams, you can witness the next thirty years of missile technology unfolding before you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variety of missiles, from ship-mounted seaslugs to satellite killers, are prepared and launched from the cold igneous valley. Occasionally, either to test antimissile lasers or flak, national news media are invited to witness the launch of an older declassified missile type and after which the broadcasts extoll the wonders of Vekllei missile technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special footage of all launches at Strawberry are captured using an odd device with a hefty name — the National Labs Autokinetheodolite. This machine is capable of recording high-velocity objects from very far away, and are used in civil supersonic aviation also. It sits atop a platform with the rest of the carefully-vetted news media, watching an anti-ship guided missile roar into life and sail in a graceful ark into the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Vekllei is small, and highly populated, a special prohibited air corridor guides the missiles west of Montre and out into the North Vekllei Sea. The arctic seabed is littered with many prototypes of this kind, and is patrolled regularly by navy ships to discover enemy submersibles seeking to engage in deep-sea espionage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first six months Baron had known her, Zelda was a serious and wisened young woman who carried symptoms of her troubled past as gracefully as anyone ever could. Poverty ages a person, and she’d nurtured a calm and dispirited disposition. She did not like war films or books with unhappy endings, or loud noises or arguments. She dressed conservatively and spoke quietly and uncontroversially. She had lived a lifetime already, working in exploitation in motels and supermarkets, watching as Utah unraveled around her. She was an immigrant and uneducated, homeless and independent, and so by the time she arrived in Vekllei she was ready to settle down and live quietly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching her psyche attempt to reconcile her sombre nature with her desire to be normal and socialise with people her own age was heartbreaking. She had this pathetic, mythical idea of normal girlish life, and it took her a long time to figure out that teen-age life worked differently from films. She had a group of people she hung around, but always on the periphery. She was blatantly disposable and socially innocent, and so she carried on pretending she could somehow rework her own image into the mythologised Coca-Cola teen dream she’d clung to since California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the idea fell apart. Where she was mousy and pitiful as a school-girl, as Zelda she was uncompromising and principled. As bullying got worse, and her school friends came to resent the parasitic relationship she&amp;rsquo;d worked her way into, things eventually came to a head and the whole thing came crashing down. She got beat up pretty bad, and ruined a new school shirt, but Zelda had fought tougher creatures than Vekllei schoolgirls and she was suspended for the rest of the semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Zelda would figure out that she never really needed or wanted the sort of bubbly teen-age friends she’d imagined. Zelda was, after all, not that bubbly or teen-age. Throughout her life, her closest friends were always those that required nothing and gave her space. That was how she liked to be; loved and shown affection, but left to her own devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many dozens of little trains wind their way around mountain peaks in the centre of Vekllei. They stop at upland villages and towns of sometimes only a few dozen people, before consolidating into larger terminuses that connect nearly every village in Vekllei by rail. It is possible, should the timetables align, that you can reach &lt;a href=&#34;https://i.redd.it/cv63rwy3kik31.png&#34;&gt;the capital&lt;/a&gt; from any part of the country in under 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sprawling rail network is ubiquitous with the Vekllei landscape, where images of simple agricultural life coincide with a train or tram. They are among the most beloved services of Vekllei society, from the vehicles themselves to the people that run them. Almost every precious memory and significant occasion of Vekllei life is preceded by a trip on the train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve posted another painting of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/busvvn/catching_a_steam_locomotive_to_school/&#34;&gt;Vekllei trains here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor&amp;rsquo;s note: this article, while ready for reading, is still under construction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering both the length and convoluted terminology that embroil this project, there was only so long I could carry on before people started getting lost. The truth of it is that Vekllei is not a particularly complex or difficult project to summarise, despite the snapshot &amp;ldquo;lore in scenes&amp;rdquo; approach that kneecaps a complete understanding. I&amp;rsquo;m just lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Vekllei is not a particularly challenging idea. It is unique, but some days that&amp;rsquo;s about all it has going for it. The word itself — &lt;strong&gt;Vekllei&lt;/strong&gt; — refers to both the landscape and the people of an island we know as Iceland. This project looks at that country and its people across a span of about fifty years, mostly between 2070 and 2120. As an alt-history, timelines diverge between our world and theirs in the 1940s, although Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s history is much older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vekllei is utopia, but Vekllei is not perfect&lt;/em&gt;. It is constructed under a framework of &lt;em&gt;utopie concrète&lt;/em&gt;, where dreamlike landscapes and characters collide with the dirt and dysfunction of reality. To some people, the contradictions and imperfection of Vekllei society would disqualify it as utopia, especially in an orthodox understanding of the idea, but Western cultural orthodoxy is not the metric used by a Vekllei person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei people instead use Vekllei cultural metrics, and to a Vekllei person it is the patina of things — its imperfections and tragedy — that recognise the beauty in life itself, as markers of both existence and usefulness. This cultural intuition is a central tenant of &lt;strong&gt;Upen&lt;/strong&gt;, Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s nondenominational animism and universal spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, Vekllei is undeniably heavenly. It is a gorgeous country of spiritual satisfaction and earnest friendship. Your first day in Vekllei is a dizzying spiritual experience. The weight of the world seems to shift, and then rise off your shoulders. Colour and vitality disentangle themselves from injustice and consumption and pivot to meet you. Food is good and free, strangers are friendly and bursting with lively purposefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei understands itself as a city-state. This colours a lot of how Vekllei people think of themselves. In practice, there are many distinct &amp;lsquo;cities&amp;rsquo; — the Capital, Little Vekllei, Copette, Ro, Montre and Adouisneh are the largest of them — but they are not recognised as such or federated in Vekllei geographic lexicon. Vekllei is a single continuous neighbourhood, circling nearly the entire coast of their island. Vekllei is also the land on which they sit, which predates the country by millions of years and informs many principles of Upen, which go on to manifest in public policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei cities are almost entirely built according to a single architectural school, &lt;strong&gt;Newda&lt;/strong&gt;, which manifests in many different ways but is almost always obviously a flavour of midcentury modernism. Water and concrete define Vekllei cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vekllei flag is an unornamented purplish red, known as the &amp;lsquo;Domestic Standard&amp;rsquo;. Internationally, they employ a highly decorated flag called the &amp;lsquo;International Standard,&amp;rsquo; which features both the &lt;em&gt;Oa&lt;/em&gt; national flower (and omnipresent symbol in every corner of society) and Vekllei logographic script, called &lt;em&gt;Topet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei has five language systems, which contribute to the single national language &amp;ndash; also called Vekllei. There is spoken Vekllei,  &lt;strong&gt;Topet&lt;/strong&gt; (logographic Vekllei script), &lt;strong&gt;Rapotenne&lt;/strong&gt; (name-script), &lt;strong&gt;Vekllei semaphore&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Potenne&lt;/strong&gt; (hand-talk) or &lt;strong&gt;Upotenne&lt;/strong&gt; (spirit-hand-talk). Potenne is a sign language used with or in place of speech, and Upotenne is a way of manifesting physical runes specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei cities are very colourful, because colour has great meaning. You can construct sentences using only colour and shapes through Vekllei semaphore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sort of lifestyle is possible because of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s abolishment of work, commodity and consumption. In the case of Vekllei, this means that people do not use money and work only for personal benefit, as both ways of actualising themselves and keeping useful or socialising. Not all work is equally difficult or interesting, but everyone must work in fairness. For some, that means as little as a few hours a week copy-editing neighbourhood newsletters. For others, they may work weeks without days off. The consequence of this is that value and products are valueless in any real sense, as post-scarcity relegates the functioning Vekllei economy to autonomous overproduction and waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of why people work is not an especially difficult one. In Vekllei, where money has not existed for a long time and generations are raised without it, basic premises of motivation have been reconsidered. Life in Vekllei is mostly a largely individual march towards actualisation, through several avenues of pleasure. There is the enjoyment of food and culture, the intimacy of love and marriage, the heritage in family and blood, and the power of work and professional legacy. Only a handful of these contribute to the pleasure of work, but in a society that has mostly done away with menial work through automation and advanced robotics, pleasure is mostly what you make of it. In Vekllei, this is called &lt;strong&gt;Product Socialism&lt;/strong&gt;, an inaccurate nominer that describes both the bureau system of work and distribution and Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s fundamental syndicalism. In politics, it is called &lt;strong&gt;Sundress Municipalism&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of life for almost any other person in today&amp;rsquo;s world, however, has declined slowly by nearly any metric. People are, on average, poorer and hungrier than they were fifty years ago. Various contradictions — in startling contrast to Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s own schisms — have left previously dignified superpowers in disorienting cycles of bloodshed and madness. In the U.S., a large number of confederate states have reasserted their sovereignty following the collapse of the Ford Motor Company and the Northrop corporation. Cultural reforms in Red China have left vast wings of the CCP disatissfied with current leadership, with whispers of a coup. Western Europe has rediscovered her reactionary heritage and indulged in a serious of increasingly authoritarian traditionalist movements, and the export economy of the Soviet Union has collapsed after the shift towards atomic fuels. Vekllei rejects millions of applications for asylum each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circumstance of the world is only made more tragic by the relative peace and stability of Vekllei, and the simplicity and carefree lifestyle of the average Vekllei person. Vekllei has the most flowers per capita of any country in the world. The last fifty years has seen the melting of much of the poles and the the introduction of el nino summers and instant winters that wrack Germany, Austria, Italy, and much of temperate Europe. The Adriatic seems to see more gloom than mediterranean sun these days. The equatorial deserts of the world, Nevada included, are mere degrees away from unsurvivable. With temperatures frequently breaking 50C (125F) throughout the year, it thins the population of Southerners too old or too poor to avoid the heat. North Africa is a husk. There is no water and no food. There is a reason there are mass graves all across the shores of the Black Sea, and why Europe tastes the boot. There is a reason the southern African states are crumbling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vekllei, with her extreme daylight cycles and polar latitude, the weather has improved significantly. Summers are warm enough to host outdoor activities for much of the season and winters are milder than previously, rarely dropping below freezing. Vekllei life, in its insular fashion, has been somewhat improved by the destabilisation of the climate. Lush temperate rainforests cover much of its lowlying basins, and rich volcanic soils spoil agricultural endevour in the warm seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s current prosperity has enabled the country to embark on her final project. The benefits of industrialisation and contemporary post-scarcity are employed in a serious effort to reestablish localised, agrarian life built upon the unit of the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei understands the the achievements of industry as a liberationist tool to return to preindustrial, satisfying life. It is not as though the country will abolish three centuries of tremendous progress — quite the contrary, in fact. But understood through petticoat ideology, the marriage of labour and the ordinary person can only occur through self-satisfying, personal work. This is in contrast, one can suppose, to mechanised, industrial labour to which we owe our enormous wealth. To a Vekllei person, work is social, productive, creative and satisfying. The simple pleasures of agriculture; specialised craftsman and tradesman; artistry — these are the fruits only of a society that can afford them, since they necessitate the deindustrialisation of agriculture, factory manufacturing and mass media simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So even though Vekllei is by all measures an industrial society; a land of helijets and plenty; the people of this country see automation as the deindustrialisation of society, at least culturally — a return to community employment, decentralised agriculture and tending of the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei is a fundamentally female country. This is what &lt;strong&gt;petticoat society&lt;/strong&gt; means. There are plenty of men in it, and quite distinct social constructs for men and women exist in a way that distinguishes the country from traditional progressive projects, but the feminisation of the economy and politics remains. Vekllei economic gender theory understands masculinity as first and foremost a  value to be consumed in industrial society, in a perverse sort of value exchange. Men are first commodified and then broken through work, killed in wars, are suffocated emotionally, and so forth. The very premise of  manhood, as the 1950s understands it (which this world is very much immersed in) is not just a biological or social construct, but an economic one. As Vekllei progresses, and erases these identifiers of masculinity, men will become female first in an economic sense (in a process called economic feminisation), and will eventually become females socially also. These are gender constructs that are essentially still prescribed by traditional Vekllei values, but are tied to the  deindustrialisation of the country. The perfect Vekllei society is one in which the man dies with the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Vekllei is not a traditional egalitarian experiment, and is often a land of absurd contradiction in Western political tradition, Vekllei women enjoy a society built for them. Womanhood in the country is not defined by commodity or appearance, but by ideas the culture associates with womanhood — compassion, bravery, intelligence, grace, etc. They are defined not by their relationships or their economic circumstance, but by their friends, political opinions, ability, etc. The decommodification of society has also decommodified womanhood. Vekllei is not simply a good place to be a woman, but is in fact a female country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you might have notices a certain set of recurring characters. The girl with short dark hair is Tzipora Desmoines, the character of utopia in this project. Her adoptive father, Baron, is bearded and wears half-framed spectacles. Her friend, Cobian, wears round spectacles and her hair in a ponytail. Their mutual friend, Moise, is heavy-set and has curly hair. Together, they represent a broad demographic of Vekllei people. Baron is descended from Nordic caucasians; vikings from Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s initial settlement. Tzipora and Cobian are descended from both inuits and Scandinavians, in the population explosion that followed Inuit settlement in the Danish territory. Moise is descended from Greek immigrants in the tide of immigration that followed the immediate postwar era. Although there are Vekllei people of colour, they make up a minority of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, this guide has helped to introduce you to the world in which Vekllei is situatated. I&amp;rsquo;m likely to expand in the coming days on this section, so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a world of nuclear power, gingham and moon colonisation wrapped in the aesthetic of the 50s/60s. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of poverty and suffering in it, but also tremendous hope. Vekllei is utopia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zelda, for all her outward timidity and mousiness, was mostly self-assured. In the same way that a child is self-assured, in which there is no real epistemology of the self as adults know it. Zelda never grew up to become a real teen-ager, after all — her body is forever thirteen-and-a-half, despite her mature and maternal disposition — and so she had a reckless sort of confidence that never really doubted the premise of her existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She did have many weaknesses, however, and she was very conscious of them. They were almost too many to count. The biggest of them, aside from her blatant neurodivergences, was her inability to keep weight on. In her first few months in Vekllei, her skinny frame was symptomatic of her malnourishment in the States. Then, as she struggled to stay above thirty kilos, it became a question of eating habits. Finally, the question was asked — did she have some sort of problem, here? And if so, was it something to do with Gregori syndrome, the comfortable answer? Or was it something more complex — perhaps an eating disorder?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from her small portions, she did not indicate much in common with other girls her age who struggled with image. In fact, much of physical self-loathing was directed at her thinness, which only emphasised her childish lack of figure and breastlessness. The only times Zelda ever cried over a mirror was when she saw her own scrawny frame that a healthy diet should have been able to remedy. Yet even when she pushed herself, and choked down a second serving, it seemed to hardly make a difference. It was a cycle that would haunt her for a long time, until the age when Gregori women must learn to accept their girlishness in place of traditional ideas of beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the case may have been, Zelda has never weighed more than forty kilos except in a winter coat, and she can still count her ribs in bath. What has changed — in a most wonderful way that alleviates much of her suffering — is her ability to love herself, and understand the limitations of her condition. Considering the fact that she has done so much, and despite her childlessness has mothered many boys and girls to adulthood, priorities shift and the importance of beauty fades. She spends more time today being the best Zelda she can be rather than worrying about her image. After all, image is a loser’s game in the life of a Gregori baby. Happiness is only ever found within.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Valley of Faith and Sorrow</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On her days off from her place of work in the village library, Zelda would descend the slope of the village into a great basin of creeks and flower-tundra. In the summer, when it was warm enough to sit in the sun, you could sit at one end of the valley and admire the wind rushing to meet you as it whipped through fields of flowers. For a few moments you could admire yourself for what you were — a small being in a landscape as old as the Earth. It put certain things in perspective. Some people needed to go out and look for a place that would finally make everything make sense. But, Zelda thought, sometimes you could reach the corners of the Earth and still stay where you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no greater struggle in a Vekllei person’s life than that with themselves. Work, like recreation and indeed like consumption itself, is social in this country. Most ordinary material whims of a person can be satisfied in a matter of hours, depending on the nearest station’s timetable. A handful of dreams are also accessible — a trip to the moon, for instance, is a matter of writing the Moon Office and waiting to receive tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without money, there is not much by way of commodity. And without commodity, the premises of life and identity have to be interrogated. A cultural intuition that hasn’t been seen in developed countries since before the industrial revolution has reawakened, and with it come uneasy existential questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are we doing here, on this planet? What am &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; doing here? How do I come to terms with the fact that everything is either moving away from or moving towards nothingness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the pit of material desire sits in other nationalities, the Vekllei person has a great deal of social anxiety. This phenomenon has only become more severe now that recovery from the Great Atomic War is nearly complete and Vekllei’s security in the world is mostly assured. Life for most people now engages with their immediate surrounds — family, community, and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While any combinations of these things can actualise a person, and even rehabilitate the directionless, it doesn’t work out like that for everyone. Family bonds often sever; communities can be transitory; love is elusive. Even with these things, the question of purpose is more pertinent than ever before, as the whole world approaches a reality without human labour. Just what is it that makes life worth living?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This explains, in part, why Vekllei people may not be much happier for all their enormous collective wealth. Despite the richness of their culture, optimism for their future and satisfaction with their conditions, none of these things properly emancipate the heart of utopia from its existential question — is it possible to automate humanity right out of humans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Vekllei people meet that golden horizon, and cross that rubicon, what waits for human intuition on the other side? Will it be endless days of poolsides and dinner parties? Or will it destroy the soul of our animalistic origins — leaving us desperate for value as useful people, and our purpose in work? Whatever the case may be, Vekllei is rapidly approaching it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for breaking my streak everyone, I&amp;rsquo;m on beta software and it totally shit the bed these last couple days. I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing my best to hobble along until full release :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora is easily squished. In this picture Moise would be around 16, Cobian 15, and Tzipora about 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moise has lost a lot of weight and has been blessed with a hefty frame befitting his temperament. Tzipora &amp;rsquo;s tastes in clothes are specific and mostly unchanging, except for a brief phase a few years after her arrival where she started poaching neckties for her own use. Cobian is conscious of and struggles with the fact that she is not particularly photogenic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourteen girls from the 23rd Chapel Explorer’s Club and two of their supervisors have been airlifted to safety after heavy rains overran the banks of the Rumoisen rivulet. The girls, aged between 10 and 16, found themselves stranded on the southern face of Mt Resner for three nights after the single bridge to the area’s trails was washed away in Thursday’s storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clear skies Saturday allowed air rescue services from Montre to reinforce the tiny Rumoisen Village fire brigade, and by Sunday morning a mammoth rescue operation involving two 45th Brigade helijets and several rescue teams brought Rumoisen’s girls home to safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, the risk of flash storms in early June is quite high, and are difficult to plan around,” Rumoisen Brigade Chief Toumisian de Angelo told press. “Always consult forecasts before embarking. We’re very relieved to have got everyone out safely.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chief of the 23rd Chapel Explorer’s Club announced Sunday that a wreath would be presented to their heroes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helijets are the backbone of Vekllei’s domestic air fleet. Not only are they employed in broad capacities for work, but also form a fleet of ‘air busses’ for public transport in Vekllei’s three largest districts: the Capital, Montre, and Copette. They depart from the roofs of large buildings, usually offices or department stores, and shuttle passengers to express destinations like airports or cosmodromes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They come in many forms and are manufactured by several companies in Vekllei, including the famous Ramoin-Dupont Aircraft Company and Vekllei National Aerocraft Factories, but most usually maintain flight through multiple turbojets attached to their sides and are propulsed by horizontal turbojets atop the stabilisers. By 2070, almost all are nuclear and use similar sunburst-style direct-air-cooled reactors found in Vekllei’s nuclear fighters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ones pictured here are Fire Jets, used usually for personnel transport and rescue operations, but can also be fitted with large water tanks for fighting bush and chemical fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although rotors are still used on some aircraft, most of the world has decided helijets are the future, and Vekllei, hardly coy around glamorous technologies, has followed suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tanny was twenty-five and as colourful as her flaming red hair implied. She was a once-in-a-generation editor, the kind of person who absorbed grammar rules on magical wavelengths beyond mortal comprehension and proceeded to violently enforce them. This was compounded by the Vekllei language, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://vekllei.city/language/&#34;&gt;its sublanguages and logography&lt;/a&gt;, leading to daily shouting matches in The Atlantic’s newsroom over sentence structure and colour as language. Although only a copy editor, there was no doubt in anyone’s mind that she would be head honcho one day. Already, in her youth, she wilted senior correspondents — middle-aged men — with her expressions of contempt as she thumbed her way through their drafts, licking her finger on every other page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Vekllei News Agency&lt;/strong&gt; is the bureau of the nation’s premier broadcaster and newspaper of record, and includes several companies you may already be familiar with, like the &lt;strong&gt;Vekllei Broadcasting Company&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/strong&gt; daily broadsheet. In Vekllei, a bureau is an organisation made up of the largest trade unions of the country, and is usually somewhat beholden to national direction and public interest. Many different companies can operate under a bureau, but at least outwardly the Agency is Vekllei’s singular national “public broadcaster and press”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Agency is one of Vekllei’s largest institutions and operates as a core pillar of Vekllei culture, as it publishes all matter of media material, from magazines to children’s programming. Television is popular in Vekllei, but as a particularly social country cinemas remain the most popular places to find newsreels, and documentaries are shown nationwide daily at six in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei has an endless supply of eager journalism students looking to report from abroad, and has consolidated news bureaus in almost every major city across the world, from Brisbane to Bogota. A special few go on to become war correspondents and foreign investigators, usually after receiving military training in mandatory service. Vekllei’s largest camera manufacturer, FilmFoto, produces specialised equipment for her news services that include gyroscope-mounted film cameras and portable audio equipment. Every Vekllei journalist carries a card guaranteeing them medical care across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Agency’s iconic “children’s blocks” logo has been in use since 2030, and is often simplified into three red squares without Vekllei characters. It is animated playfully to suit programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei is also home to the International Federation of Journalists, who maintain a headquarters in her Publishing District.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With nearly two dozen daily broadsheets, six news studios and countless independent rags, Vekllei enjoys a colourful and noisy media landscape that is suspended between the worlds of old and new, in a way that reflects the Vekllei as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introducing Moise</title>

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moise was a fat kid who went to another school. Zelda only knew him from the tram, where he carried a criminal stigma because of his rumoured gang affiliations. He was a second-generation Vekllei boy of immigrant Greek heritage. There were a few ethnic gangs in his area, and most immigrant boys that didn’t do well in school quickly found other causes to fight for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zelda quickly antagonised the boy by offering him to her own bullies. She would point out his weight and he’d point out her clumsy Vekllei language skills and apparent lack of intelligence commonly attributed to foreigners, and so the arms race began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullying did not come naturally to either of them, since they were on the receiving end most of the time and were not particularly manipulative. She would tell Moise he stunk, he would say she was skeletal and unattractive, and they’d seethe about each other that evening. She would make fun of him for eating a chocolate on the tram, and he stole a hairclip and wouldn’t give it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day she was walking behind him after alighting the tram and had set to whacking him with her bookbag, demanding the return of her red pencil. She kept pushing him. In a fit of anger he slammed her against a garage door repeatedly, where her head bounced against the corrugated steel and nearly knocked her out. He left her incapacitated on the pavement, and fled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He buzzed her apartment the following evening after school, seeking to apologise. She weighed her own crimes against his attack, using unique Zelda metrics that gauged physical and emotional violence somewhat improportionately. She accepted his apology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus began the kind of awkward and unconventional friendship that Zelda seemed to attract. With entrepreneurial zeal she rarely displayed, she struck a deal with Moise — he would teach her to fight, and she would help him lose weight. He did not have much experience talking to girls, which was both revealing and endearing, but it helped that Zelda was socially maladjusted and not particularly girlish. On weekends he would take her to the nearest park, they’d lay out a blanket, remove their shoes, and he’d show her how to use a bigger opponent’s weight against them. During the week, she’d meet him at the tram station and they’d go for long walks until he was red and puffing. Zelda liked making food, which seemed to be the one thing she was good at, and soon after began preparing his school lunches, which she’d pass surreptitiously on the morning tram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although they grew close, they both recognised her condition would make any romantic relationship inappropriate and so they remained each other’s quiet soulmates as he went on to film school and married. Moise’s wife, an incredibly patient woman of enormous spiritual strength, would soon learn to tolerate Zelda’s presence at their life occasions. Although Zelda would often think about what might have been if she’d only been normal, they remained close for the rest of his life and she would remain a close family member and guardian of his children for decades after his passing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the notebook of Tzipora:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total hedonism across a thousand generations produced the creature known as the ‘tooth regent’, who was a human by technicality but was built genetically only for consuming. His name was Arhen CIII, and where his ancestors had mouths, he had a thousand teeth that sat in messy rows to the back of his throat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three times a day his mouth had to be washed by palace maidens, and excess teeth brushed off. At night, as he slept, the teeth would grow back and occasionally sprout from his cheeks and chin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was one of the most powerful men in all of Zen, the land of gem deserts and magic, and tales of his brutality echoed among the large cities of the subcontinent. His jaws were mounted in his face like hunting traps, and upon bad news he would order the messenger’s hand to be placed in his mouth. That would clamp shut, the poor soul would scream, and minced meat would be spat out by the regent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a man built for consumption, luxury became lust. Like his father and his father’s father, he quickly became the richest oligarch of the Zo peninsula, acquiring old magic, artefacts, estates and fine foods like a glutton piles supper on a plate. It was not possession that motivated him, but acquisition and consumption, destroying hedonistically objects that might lift a thousand from poverty or heal the sick. The simple biological impulses of a human were so primitive compared to Arhen, who satisfied his genetics with an insatiable lust for growth and purchase. Over and over, the cycle would continue…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, he was on his way to becoming a Palace God, in which the essence of his family dynasty was being rewritten to a higher place of purpose. But where the Palace Gods derive their powers from superstition and traditions, the Arhen bloodline cultivate godhood through industry and commodity subsumption of the orgasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arhen’s greed, or rather, his purpose, was only satisfied by the acquisition and consumption of one invaluable product — himself. He mortgaged his soul into his estate, through the aid of a spirit-banker, and set to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maidens recall hearing only snorts and ecstatic screeches from his room for days. It was not uncommon for the regent to snort — his airways were severely deformed by his posthumanism — but it soon seemed to replace his loud breathing altogether, as though he were talking to himself in pig. This went on for a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, on the eve of the new Zen calendar, his favourite maiden dared enter. She was called Zamen, and being a strong-willed woman, had attracted some level of respect from the otherwise inhuman Ahren. She found the bedroom empty, except for a pair of fine shoes and a small pile of teeth. It was suddenly clear to her what had happened — finally, the prince had completed his cycle and consumed &lt;em&gt;himself&lt;/em&gt;. His father had cycled out the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That day ushered in the regency of Ahren CIV, and the cycle of consumption would begin anew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foundations of a Vekllei neighbourhood, repeated so often to foreigners and children, is the community — a group of people larger than a family but small enough to have valuable social bonds through work and shared spaces. In a society without currency, value is almost entirely derived from your immediate surrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Municipal police, as distinct from Venrouiva police, appear in many different roles in Vekllei communities. There are officers as we’d understand them, but there are also many employees of the municipal police that deal exclusively with social work, mental health and substance dependency. These social workers, while employed by a neighbourhood police department, are not actually police officers and do not have the ability to detain people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All constables ride in cars built like European cruisers but styled like American ones, with many lights and an obvious presence on Vekllei’s empty roads. All of them are electric, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/a7ltvy/the_suburban_constabulary/&#34;&gt;motorcycles still use combustion engines&lt;/a&gt;. The type of car used varies between municipalities, but the markings are the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more of a concept sketch than anything, I&amp;rsquo;m just refining how I think it should look. Feedback appreciated, as always!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zelda liked to sleep beside someone, which made her feel safe and loved, but she never had many friends and she hadn’t a mother to share a bed with. And, despite her enthusiasm, she was not very easy to sleep beside. She was prone to jerking movements and night terrors, and alternated between pushing her partner to the periphery and then clutching them in comfort. Like so much of who she was, she was caught between contradictory aesthetics and ideas — at home she might sleep in days-old clothes or underwear, but at Cobian’s house she wore a neat nightdress that emphasised her simple middle-class tastes. Poverty and nouveau riche, rude and sweet, boyish and cute. Her eternal schisms were put aside in sleep, where only the lithe ghost of her childhood remained, breathing quietly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Supermarkets in Vekllei</title>

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Vekllei, the economy is a social organ that lingers awkwardly between cultural and political interests. On one hand, the country is regressing (both politically and culturally) towards deindustrialised, decommodified life. On the other, it is irreversibly equipped with the benefits of automation and robotics, rendering large swathes of the labour-force obsolete. Work is now, for most purposes, a creative organ that facilitates society, culture and technology. This has led to a society not unlike most planned economies, in which employment is both essential and unnecessary, leading to vast wastage and consumption at scales a market would see as horrifically inefficient but in Vekllei is understood as an enormous social benefit. Some people must still work — so everyone must work in fairness. In Vekllei, employment is casual and often unrecorded except by the syndicates, as per the foundations of Sundress Municipalism. As long as you are working, studying or otherwise justifying a life in Vekllei (raising your children or training for competitions, perhaps), then you’ll be left alone to do what you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since everyone must work, there are many archaic jobs in Vekllei, especially for those still figuring out what they want to do with their lives. The supermarket now rules across most of the world, but in Vekllei there are only a handful of chains with few stores, simply because the provincial self-interest of Sundress Municipalism is sympathetic to individual stores populated by a community, rather than chains. The corner grocer is king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since these supermarkets are often built in imitation of the west, and are remarkably un-Vekllei, the largest three chains are illustrated above for your benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comen Grocer&lt;/strong&gt; is the only pre-Atomic War supermarket company in Vekllei, and offers mostly special-interest or foreign products. It actually operates under the same retail bureau that runs the &lt;strong&gt;Farmer’s Syndicate&lt;/strong&gt;, but is independent. It is run by a board of representatives from each store, whom are elected. Roman here has platinum hair and is a good example of an ethnically Scandinavian Vekllei person, who has descendants dating back to the 11th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joyloaf&lt;/strong&gt; operates in the Lola district of Vekllei’s capital, and is a popular day job for artistic young women who otherwise do not have the means or time to socialise with people their own age. It started as a bakery in 2064 but has since grown to stock many different kinds of foods. It is quite fashionable in Lola, and appears in cultural material originating from that district (as seen in several comics and films). Tzipora has dark hair and a round face, but blue eyes and fair skin. She is a descendent of both Inuits and Scandinavians, making her a member of the second-largest ethnic group in Vekllei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Farmer’s Syndicate&lt;/strong&gt; is both a name and a description of Vekllei’s &lt;em&gt;venrouive&lt;/em&gt; food retail arm, which means that it is beholden to the direction of the country and would be the organisation called upon to provide rations in the event of war. It is a collective of agricultural villages and organisations and operates as a distributor of these products directly. It almost exclusively stocks Vekllei products, as well as “items of cultural significance” that are traditionally eaten in ceremony and ritual, but are otherwise most popular with Vekllei’s elderly population. The Farmer’s Syndicate is the largest supermarket chain in Vekllei, but very few of its stores are actually supermarkets — many individual grocers &lt;em&gt;senrouive&lt;/em&gt; business operate under the Syndicate’s structure, but often do not brand themselves as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supermarkets are fundamentally a novelty in Vekllei, which has a vibrant cafe reputation and in which most food prepared at home is grown locally. Food production is a very important part of Vekllei culture and Upen, and the desacralising effect of chains are symptoms of an industrial, globalised society. This is an unattractive proposition to a country rapidly approaching isolationist pre-industry, in which the cycles of production and consumption are both visible and important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A road trip around Vekllei in the summer is an experience that makes life worth living. In some ways, it is a spiritual detox than reinvigorates a person with the intimate, elusive premise of the Vekllei spiritual enlightenment. In others, it is a way of returning to the earth, and understanding the human place in the principles of &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.millmint.net/utopia/vekllei/culture/religion/&#34;&gt;Upen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter your intention, be it holiday or rediscovery, the very best of Vekllei is on display. Liberated of the desacralising effect of routine, the villages and factories you’ll zoom past take on new and extraordinary light. Removed from it, you see better how society works. The complex web of logistics, from roaring trains on adjacent rail lines to squinting at a passing nuclear flying wing through the sun roof, are now aesthetic indications of petticoat society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The All-Atomic Auto Company betrays its name instantly by not offering a single reactor-powered vehicle in its entire catalogue. Indeed, commercial reactors are so heavy that they are only realistically mounted in truck frames, even in Vekllei’s insensitivity to cost. You simply cannot fit a fission reactor into a small auto. At least, not yet. In fact, in countries where costs are concern, it is feasible that reactor technology as we currently understand it will never be economical in the frame of a small auto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AAAC is actually an industrial concern of several Vekllei venrouive bureaus negotiating commercial atomics with the future. These include famous companies like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/a64ahs/the_cosmojet/&#34;&gt;General Reactor&lt;/a&gt;, which are at the forefront of global reactor technology and compete directly with Raytheon, and Common Battery. Several lesser known, unglamorous companies also contribute to the cooperative concern. Astrotransmissions supply transmissions and Montre-Rayon Foundry provide composite steels. The AAAC has an internal design house, but most of its staff are poached from appliance manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result are a series of small, playful cars with colourful paints and a friendly look. They’re sleek and fun without being toylike, and recall remarkable household appliance designs like Fettener Kettles or Vekllei Supernational television sets. Although AAAC autos are not yet atomic, they are almost entirely electric and fueled by Vekllei’s atomic and geothermal plants, legitimising the concern’s name partially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flagship of AAAC is the Cherry, the first mass-market vehicle the company has brought to international market. Several stereotypical errors were made introducing it to the non-Vekllei world, including the unusual name and even more unusual tagline — “The Future Car for an Eternal Summer.” In Vekllei, summer is a feminine, fragrant season of warmth and rebirth. The way it was transliterated makes it seem like a reference to the world’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/c21zvo/hot_summers_in_the_arctic_and_newda_architecture/&#34;&gt;rapidly destabilising climate and ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;, which is inching the globe towards economic collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The car was a flop in the States, but saw moderate success in Europe. In Vekllei, it is one of the most common cars you’ll find in autopools today and is a favourite among road-trippers circumnavigating Vekllei’s diverse coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m starting a series looking at the lives and machines of domestic Vekllei life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei National Railways, or ‘VK Rail’ was the bastard of six major pre-war rail companies that were extinguished along with the society that housed them. Today there are three rail companies in Vekllei, but all of them operate under direct supervision of a Vekllei Industry Bureau (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/blqcwl/utopia_the_participatory_economy_of_vekllei/&#34;&gt;making it Venrouiva&lt;/a&gt;, in other words) and are only broken up for reasons of logistics. So even though a train may run under the Montre Inclinantor Rail Company, it is fundamentally a Vekllei National Railways train much in the same way that all regional airlines are actually fully subsumed by Vekllei International Airways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few characters you’ll find at every manned Vekllei station have been illustrated below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first, the &lt;strong&gt;locomotive engineer&lt;/strong&gt;, drives a train in four hour shifts. They wear a shoulder plate to distinguish them from other miscellaneous station staff and carry a pedigree in Vekllei culture, as a country dependent almost entirely on rail internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each station has a &lt;strong&gt;station master&lt;/strong&gt;, who manages the station. In small stations, they do many types of work including maintenance and assisting public enquiry. In large stations, like Vekllei Central Terminus, there are dozens of station masters commanding multiple platforms each and are extremely demanding jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most stations also have a most unusual employee, nicknamed in Vekllei a ‘&lt;strong&gt;daughter&lt;/strong&gt;’ or ‘&lt;strong&gt;son of the station&lt;/strong&gt;,’ who are usually children or teen-agers particularly interested in entering employment with Vekllei Rail and are thus apprenticed in many different roles. They are usually taught some English in a special extracurricular programme and are used as guides for tourists, as Vekllei signage is usually written only in the country’s native tongue. After a few hours of miscellaneous works a child of the station might ride the trains, checking carriages and platforms for cleanliness and observing passenger behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, stations have been adopting &lt;strong&gt;station dogs&lt;/strong&gt; to help lift spirits among commuters and tourists alike. These dogs, usually of breeds too large for Vekllei apartment lifestyles, have no work but to meet people and offer pets to passing commuters. Some are trained in rescue and as service dogs to those who need them, but for the most part they are simply large dogs in uniform who wander with the station master or child of the station to look for love from strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At nearly 20,000kms of rail, Vekllei has one of the most dense and intricate rail systems in the world. Stations are built to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/busvvn/catching_a_steam_locomotive_to_school/&#34;&gt;receive modern transonic maglevs and century-old steam engines simultaneously&lt;/a&gt;, and nearly 15,000 people are employed in some form to keep these railways running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first saw this film at a low point in my life, and watching Shizuku discover her ability was one of the most touching things I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. I&amp;rsquo;m not a big fan-art guy, but I still find myself thinking about them years later and I wanted to paint them happy after the end of the film. Shizuku&amp;rsquo;s got a second draft and Seiji&amp;rsquo;s reading it for the first time (maybe not far from Cremona!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve imitated the animation style (I&amp;rsquo;m a clumsy digital artist, which is a pity since it&amp;rsquo;s my only medium). You might even notice the character plates have their own shadow on the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vekllei is a country in my alt-world; a utopian fever dream of googie aesthetics, participatory economics and nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the ‘Petticoat Project’, a collection of stories about a country and a girl. The concept is broken down into three sections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt; for blog posts and articles on the Petticoat Project, utopian fiction, personal news item, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Character:&lt;/strong&gt; for posts about Tzipora, people in her life, or otherwise events that occur during her time on Earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Landscape:&lt;/strong&gt; for articles on Vekllei and her society, incorporating all that goes with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, read on for an introduction to this project and what I intend to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-epilogue-to-the-epoch-of-rest&#34;&gt;The Epilogue to the Epoch of Rest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core of the Vekllei project is in understanding utopian fiction as a viable means for expressing yourself in two arenas. Creative, as a way of articulating a worldview, and personal, as a way of introspection and projection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the creative worldview is that of Vekllei  — a thought experiment in economics, socialpolitik, infrastructure, architecture, demographics, spirituality, language, actualisation, etc. The personal product is Tzipora — a character of good mannerisms, language, sense of fashion, ideological disposition, personality and body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise of an epoch of rest is that the problems unique to an author, the conductor of the orchestra, can be reasoned with and turned into beautiful monuments in a way they can’t in reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running low on money? Vekllei does not use money  — go to a cinema, eat out; have a nice time. Likewise, are you shameful of your body or your ability? Tzipora is fraught with problems, too — but look at her! She is beautiful. Repeat this process for all creative arenas and you will find a world you can escape to, away from the problems of your reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that utopia and perfection are two different things. A city can be utopian without it being perfect  — a relative judgement. Carrying on in this sense, the concept of utopia can equally be applied to a person. The character is not necessarily a romantic interest or charming or intelligent or sexual product, because none of those things really describe utopia  — instead, a person (a utopian?) is perfect as a collection of ideas and experience. Vekllei is a place of utopia, Tzipora is utopian. And so there are three actors in this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-author&#34;&gt;The Author&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The producer of the whole thing, the creative and personal products are theirs, as unique as a fingerprint. They most likely produce a lot of different societies and characters in trying to tell a story, or flesh out an idea they’ve had  — but for the purposes of the idea of an epoch of rest, there are two perfect utopias: landscape (society and the world), and character (personality and appearance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vekllei-vɛklaɪ&#34;&gt;Vekllei [/vƐk.laɪ/]&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei is a country in which the external burdens of the world can be shifted. Worries are relegated to the personal  — an arena in utopian fiction that conveniently still falls under the domain of the author. In Vekllei, self-actualisation is tangible, vivid, only metres away. It might be in creativity or power or love, but it is attainable, because the economic and cultural orchestra of the country is in the imagination of the author, and so it is perfect as by definition of utopia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tziporazelda-desmoines-dzɪpˈɔːrədɛmwəːnɛːh&#34;&gt;Tzipora/Zelda Desmoines [/dzɪpˈɔːr.ə’dƐm.wəːn.Ɛːh/]&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Vekllei is the arena of external burden, Tzipora is a girl on which the internal pressures of self-doubt and conscious flaw are cast aside like a rag. In the sense of a narrative, Tzipora might suffer because of her behaviours (her nervous tics, her jealousy, her body and image), but they are adopted in a way that is graceful. So despite her fierce problems, it fades away in the fact that she will not die; she will not be unsuccessful; she will not be unloved. As long as those core premises are true, then every other nervous tic or obsessive-compulsive behaviour are commodity; window-dressing to an aesthetic taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is sort of what I want to do, and I can’t imagine slowing down anytime soon. Stick around and I’ll do my best materialise the world and story of Vekllei. Thanks for stopping by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind regards,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/c21zvo/hot_summers_in_the_arctic_and_newda_architecture/&#34;&gt;Previous post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, two casualties were reported among Vekllei’s &lt;em&gt;Folifedestarmie&lt;/em&gt; 24th and 25th Garden Companies in the ongoing war to make the capital’s parks the finest in the world. Michael Helen-Louisviuan cut his leg on an exposed nail during the deinstallation of old fence posts, and Ana Po cut her thumb on a rose. Both attackers were neutralised appropriately, through planned deinstallation and some mild pruning. The reports were passed onto the local Garden command, where they were filed and will eventually be destroyed after ten years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vekllei, where a military service of four years is mandatory between the ages of 18 and 32, the purpose of conscription is twofold; first, to ensure the citizenry is at least lightly trained should an invasion follow &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/auz580/the_forgotten_generation/&#34;&gt;a nuclear strike&lt;/a&gt;, and second; to ensure that important jobs in the country that are not easily automated are always filled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A breakdown of the most common roles a Vekllei person will enter upon conscription:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Service roles, 4%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/ab6m9p/on_childhood_and_modernity/&#34;&gt;Education&lt;/a&gt;, 2%&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The garden battalions are not simply the pacifist’s way out — there are many other jobs for principled people. Instead, they appeal mostly to those nearing the end of their eligible conscription age who are looking to get service out of the way before family-making or major career advancement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, conscription for most Vekllei people is a rite of passage that mimics preindustrial ritual, and otherwise defines the transition to adulthood in a country that has largely desegregated aged schooling. It is one of the few times in a Vekllei persons’ life in which the organs of power of the country will interfere directly with their lives, making conscription a welcome structure for young Vekllei boys n gals not yet sure what to do with their lives. Indeed, many of the roles taken on during service will echo throughout their working lives, as gardeners become council planners and labourers become robotics engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth of automation and work as pleasure is that the unfettered freedom and hedonism of the Vekllei lifestyle can often feel as aimless and agoraphobic as it does liberating. The four years of service in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/98trlw/allweather_combat_for_the_atomic_age/&#34;&gt;Vekllei’s military&lt;/a&gt; reflect Vekllei in total — both in its confronting usurpation of traditional institutions &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/blqcwl/utopia_the_participatory_economy_of_vekllei/&#34;&gt;by petticoat ideology&lt;/a&gt; and in its tantalising, insatiable liberty and pleasure. The military will let you dip a finger into that well, and help prepare your posture for the leap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caption:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tzipora: “They were telling me! ‘We never planted them here!’ The idiots! Look at it. Tell me that is not a god-damned rose. Sitting under this rock. They must have planted them last spring. I was resting in the sun. That’s how I found it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duma: “Uh-huh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Porno is available over-the-counter at most book stores. Some industry associations attempt to limit availability to minors but generally it&amp;rsquo;s at the discretion of the shopkeeper. Often, shame and embarassment are more powerful tools than legislation in Vekllei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally it&amp;rsquo;s pretty traditional stuff supported by columns and fiction, although it varies between pornographers. It&amp;rsquo;s quite common for well-known Vekllei models to end up in nude shoots either before or after their fame. Nudity is a little more common in Vekllei than it is in the U.S. (at beaches and so on), and that relaxes the moralising of smut somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the generation previous to Tzipora&amp;rsquo;s (about 20 years prior, so around the early 2050s) were very sex-positive and deviant. Certain cultural iconography from this time is still used in porno &amp;ndash; heavy makeup, curled hair, bare thighs &amp;ndash; but this has prompted a conservatism among Tzipora&amp;rsquo;s generation towards the &amp;ldquo;vanity&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;superficiality&amp;rdquo; of their parents&#39; sexual liberation and bare skin. Today it is much more common to have skirts below the knee than above it, and pornography is starting to shift to accommodate the fetishistic and fantasy as opposed to outright explicit desire common in the previous decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;foreign porno, however, is highly prized as a sort of racialised sexual unorthodoxy (especially of Asian or Black men and women, neither of whom are particularly large racial demographics in Vekllei). It&amp;rsquo;s rare to find and not commonly traded. There are very few bureaus that import pornography, and export is far more common.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Principles of &#34;Human Decay&#34;</title>

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint yellow&#34;&gt;
  ❖ This article predates the project, and &lt;strong&gt;should be considered non-canon&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about utopia in landscape is easy — &lt;a href=&#34;https://vekllei.city/economy/&#34;&gt;Vekllei is a glittering midcentury paradise that fosters human life as a wonderful dream&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about utopia in character is much harder. How can you find utopia in flawed and sometimes unattractive human beings? By what metric is the vague, intuitive values of a utopia measured against a living person?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Upen&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://vekllei.city/religion/&#34;&gt;nondenominational animism of Vekllei&lt;/a&gt;, there is the living principle of &lt;em&gt;Dumousiantopet&lt;/em&gt;: “beautiful and seperate”. This is a modernist reconciliation of Vekllei’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://vekllei.city/hot-summers-in-the-arctic-and-newda-architecture/&#34;&gt;striking, symmetrical and clean &lt;em&gt;Newda&lt;/em&gt; architecture school&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;em&gt;Upen’s&lt;/em&gt; otherwise modest and naturalistic principles. This makes fine sense for cities and towns, in which the triumphant and monumental nature of Vekllei architecture is at odds with Vekllei’s efforts to deindustrialise through post-scarcity, but it also applies to human beings, as natural objects, in society. In Vekllei, architecture is not adapted to its environment, but built in spite of it, as recognition of Vekllei’s human-centric worldview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, however, Vekllei is a land and people deeply linked with their surrounds, in which purpose and value is drawn from their landscape and nature is an intrinsic part of life. &lt;em&gt;Dumousiantopet&lt;/em&gt; does not mean the domination of nature by human construction, but to exist together in segregation of their different systems of beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence the concept of ‘Human Decay’, or &lt;em&gt;Lemdisiandan&lt;/em&gt;, a system of human beauty that warps intuitive Western principles (the symmetrical woman, the rational man, the healthy boy, the cute girl, and so on) and worships instead decay, which in Vekllei is a positive natural process that unites all life, including landscape and human beings. Where Vekllei might build a utopian city to last a thousand years, human beauty is acknowledged to be far less eternal; it is in fact fleeting, at once suspended in a single moment and returning slowly to absence, or ‘nothingness’. In Vekllei, it it this process (and how it manifests) in which beauty is found. It is the evidence of life; the symptoms of living; the detail of imperfections in human beings that validate their place on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A worn shirt, windswept hair, sweat on your brow — small images of dignity and history in how a person talks and carries themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does this manifest? Here is Tzipora Lo Ula Desmoines, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/characterforge/comments/btfqm8/show_and_tell_meet_tzipora_desmoines_the_eternal/&#34;&gt;a girl who suffers from Gregori-Heitzfeld Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. She is a perfect example of character utopia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She is very shameful about her body and her thinness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She is angry at a lot of things and cannot let bad memories die.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She suffers from hypertension after her childhood, and is terrified of dogs and loud noises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad dreams interrupt her sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She is distinctive but well-kept, productive but inward-facing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She is afflicted with nervous tics that manifest as shirt-pulling and nose-rubbing and has had them for many years. They appear involuntarily in nervousness and pointing them out to her will only increase their intensity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She has obsessions about clothing materials and the material composition of outfits, which can affect her emotionally (she cannot stand a wool skirt and rayon shirt, for example, intersecting). These bizarre principles include the proportion and length of items, and the tightness and looseness of clothes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list could go on and on to paint a very uncomfortable and invasive picture of an otherwise quiet and happy person, but these examples neglect the many wonderful things about her — her affection and good sense of humour, her humility and loyalty, and so on. But while these good things might be employed to counteract the bad to us, to a Vekllei person they would accentuate and complete a complex and positive picture of a girl touched by ‘human decay’, an ugly phrase in English that essentially refers to the sweet detail and intricacies that evidence the life of a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human Decay does not glorify anxiety or mental illness — nor does it worship dirtiness for the sake of being dirty, or imperfection for being imperfect — but it does recognise the greatness in the texture and detail of human life. So it is that in Vekllei, splotchy birthmarks and soft skin alike are the characteristics of a beautiful person, and lend to a metric of beauty defined by storytelling and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of how Tzipora would be remembered would be in the way she appeared in the person. She was a good-looking young teen-ager of quiet and unusual movements. As she became known to the wider public, her physical appearance would come to define her as both a phenomena and disability — a victim of blessings; a sweet child of cotton and gingham carrying on in the dark schism between teen-age impetuosity and the adult world of &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt;. What a tragedy and miracle she was.Zelda, which was how she introduced herself among friends, was as intricate as she was indecipherable. She had her own internal logics; a unique carousel of intuition that marked her out as some unfortunate &lt;em&gt;undamoispotet&lt;/em&gt; among other teen-agers. In conversation that stirred any emotion in her she was susceptible to spasmodic, defensive movements that distracted from her talking. Most frequently she would pull on her nose as if to wipe it, or reach for her shirt at the shoulder and adjust it. If she was particularly self-conscious, which could be brought on even by the spasms themselves, she would take hold of her shirt and keep her hand there, as though her thin girlish arms could shield her breast from judgement. She confided in her father that she did not like the tics. The more conscious of her imperfections she was, the more her idiosyncrasies flared. He asked her once how long she’d had them — the nose rubbings, the shirt pullings — and she said she couldn’t remember, but thought it might have been after she arrived in America. Which was possible, he supposed — trauma could bring on tics, even laymen knew that. If you spend a while with her, however, it becomes more obvious that her tics are symptomatic of a nervous, fidgety subconscious not cowed by the supposed tomboyishness of her movements — she jigs a leg, and run the back of her hand beneath her nose. Then, when she realises people notice those things and judge her for them, the same synchronistic hyperactivities became shirt-pulling and face-touching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks folks. Just a quick reupload of a concept I thought worked best here :)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint yellow&#34;&gt;
  ❖ This article predates the project, and &lt;strong&gt;should be considered non-canon&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/c05k16/absolute_grotesque/&#34;&gt;Previous post here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Café Resmoiones&lt;/em&gt; approaches its hundredth birthday as the girls outside await their fifteenth. The building was once a kindergarten, so they’d been told, but through decades of Vekllei’s irreverent planning it had become a café. It was not a very good café, the food was shit, but the building was nice and it was at the bottom of Lola’s steep residential hill. Locals struggling down it would pool at the bottom and inevitably step inside for a drink. In summer, the café serves seasonal iced drinks to welcome a climate that has destroyed much of the world’s equatorial agriculture but has provided their arctic home a liveable summer. The girls dodge freckles and sip iced coffee as millions around the world flee encroaching deserts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unstable Atlantic pressure oscillation, of which Vekllei anchors as the Vekllei low pole, can pull in bitter cold from the Greenland currents, or warmth from the Azores tempestuously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is that in summer, on a beach of black igneous sand from the volcanoes of this place, hot rains can descend instantly and beat pedestrians until the rains vanish, minutes later. Winters are equally unstable — they shift between unlivable cold and sporadic thawing periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have ever spoken to a Vekllei person in English, you will notice an irritating habit of adding unnecessary vowels to words. ‘Loafer’ becomes “lowiefer”, ‘a ciggie’ becomes “des cigoirettenne”, and the concept of ‘trees’ become “tres foliage”. This is an instinctual artefact of &lt;a href=&#34;https://vekllei.city/language/&#34;&gt;Vekllei talk, which incorporates vocal gestures to accompany physical ones&lt;/a&gt;, even in foreign words. It is also how ‘nakedity”’becomes ‘Newda’, the dominant architectural school in Vekllei, found almost everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a sort of post-deco modernism, it retains the striking geometry and vertical movement of more decadent architectural styles, but employs them conservatively to better reveal naked shape — ‘newda’. It is a flexible school that manifests differently depending on the utility of the building. Residential apartments, for example, often display elements reminiscent of constructivism, where national bureaus, or ‘hard buildings’ as they’re called in Vekllei, are more brutalistic. The stripped classicism of buildings of authority stands in stark contrast to the playful googie of utilities like phone booths and public restrooms. These allusions to grand midcentury architecture are domesticated with a unique form of Vekllei populuxe, usually because of Vekllei’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://vekllei.city/language/&#34;&gt;use of colour and shape as a language in itself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have called it a &amp;lsquo;Paris moderne&amp;rsquo; for the hegemony of the modernist bastards in Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s architecture schools, but to Vekllei people, these space-age  visions of the future are home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/busvvn/catching_a_steam_locomotive_to_school/&#34;&gt;Previous post here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six bodies hung from the Rodney Creek Railroad Bridge, without names. The leftmost corpse, which was a boy, had a sign slung around his neck with tomorrow’s 8am train on it. Besides the swaying boy was his father, and next to him was his mother, and so it went down the railroad bridge, counting off his little sisters and grandmama and so on. The baby had been thrown in the creek. Who they were didn’t matter much, since the types of people hanging from bridges and trees and lampposts were cut from the same cloth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that night, a man from the Kennecott Copper Company payed a sum of four and a half million dollars in cheque towards three bastards, two pigs and a thug. For that sort of money, you could buy a home to the North and the East, far out of Utah and far out of the violence. Not that any of them would leave — the pigs had good jobs with the Sheriff’s office, the bastards had been born here and would die here, and, well, the thug just liked killing too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could trace today’s nightmare back to the collapse of the Ford Motor Company, but there were problems in the southwest long before even that. The truth of it is that there’s been a lot of anger in Utah for a long time, it&amp;rsquo;s just taken a lot longer than anyone thought it would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s quite impossible to imagine the tragedy of the U.S. in 2094, where suffering can be predicted by the latitude at which it occurs and midcentury domesticity collides with violence and power. As the U.S. Dollar inflates wildly and the Atomic Age has priced out the working man, is it any wonder that Southerners waste away beneath horizons of the quiet, rusting manufacturing plants of the southwest, where the wind whistles between conveyors once carrying bits of Pontiacs and Fords?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we saw, as the Dallas Accords failed and the talks of a total secession ascended from fantasy, was the rise of militias, company cities, industrial action, bloodshed, lynchings, racial animosity, the death of suburbs, mass killings, child labour, sexual violence, decaying infrastructure, and so on. The air was electric with opportunity to live out your wildest, most depraved fantasies. Bizarre images of single-story cul-de-sacs and a half-dozen State police excavating portions of desert existed simultaneously. The free flow of immigrants between Mexico and Arizona was quickly seized upon and exploited by companies like Anaconda Mineral and Kennecott Copper, who filled their mines with Latin Americans to shut out striking workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An immigrant labourer was dead at the signing of his contract. He was killed by vigilantes, or in a mine accident, or was simply consumed, since these people did not have names and the companies had no expectations of their longevity. That attitude soon came to shadow almost every interaction between otherwise decent people of impoverished communities — that there was no future, that they were the last generation, that the hedonistic cycle of production and consumption had become life itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hedonism of brutality and modern pornography manifested in the violence of the company militias and local sheriffs alike, and so both cannibalism and necrophilia were widespread in oft-secret killings. Desecration of corpses, mutilation of the living, and widespread lawlessness came to characterise the hell that was life in the southern U.S. in 2094. How terrifying it was that beautiful things could decay so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it was that men became creatures — lust became necrophilic, suffering became ecstasy. This mad spiral towards our worst instincts came out in full force. The biopolitics of life and consumption became the necropolitics of grotesqueing and subsumption. A girl’s sandal; poisoned bread; leaded cosmetics; copper in the mountains; apricot phosphorous on the horizon; a nuclear family in the current; six Mexicans gutted; six good boys killing for cash; whole towns cashing in and shipping out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is life in Utah today. Absolute erotic; absolute grotesque&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint yellow&#34;&gt;
  ❖ This article predates the project, and &lt;strong&gt;should be considered non-canon&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most of the kids pictured here are the cubs of lumberfolk who make a living out of felling hard pines in the mountains in the North of Vekllei. About half have dark hair and rounder faces, as descendants of both inuits and Scandinavians, and others are of mixed ancestry. Families in Vekllei are large and often nonbiological, and a single lad can have a dozen sisters. Ame Louisendopet might be a bitch on occasion, but that’s how it goes. Jo’s little sister, Popet, has decided age ten and a half that she’ll be a locomotive engineer one day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may have learned by now, Vekllei is a land of contrasts. Last year, the Lonne Rail Authority commissioned a new generation of maglev trains for blistering five-minute commutes between &lt;a href=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/vekllei.city/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_0555.png?ssl=1&#34;&gt;Little Vekllei and the Lonne terminus&lt;/a&gt;, turning an otherwise 60km journey into an unconscious gesture. At a top speed of 750km/h, the pride of Vekllei’s commuter rail seems to gunning for subsonic commuter jets head-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in the mountains around Montre, the D-006 steam locomotive approaches her 130th birthday. Where the maglev guzzles direct current from atomic power plants around the country, D-006 chews through bunker fuel — literal scrapings from a barrel somewhere — and leaves soot where she goes. Her train is not carrying businessfolk but log cars bound for the coasts, where they will be sold to Europe for furniture. In the mornings of most weekdays, the engineers and lumberjacks that man her bring their children along for the trip, where the little ones watch the engineer work the cab while the teenagers shiver on her maintenance catwalks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is dirty, slow, and makes absolutely no sense occupying a route in the space age, one marked by moon colonies and new empire. What is going on here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things begin to make a little more sense through the lens of an ordinary Vekllei person, with their own bizarre domestic intuition and frame of mind. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/blqcwl/utopia_the_participatory_economy_of_vekllei/&#34;&gt;Like we talked about previously&lt;/a&gt;, Vekllei understands the the achievements of industry as a liberationist tool to return to preindustrial, satisfying life. It is not as though the country will ‘undo’ three centuries of tremendous progress — quite the contrary, in fact. But understood through petticoat ideology, the marriage of labour and the ordinary person can only occur through self-satisfying, personal work. This is in contrast, one can suppose, to mechanised, industrial labour to which we owe our enormous wealth. To a Vekllei person, work is social, productive, creative and satisfying. The simple pleasures of agriculture; specialised craftsman and tradesman; artistry — these are the fruits only of a society that can afford them, since they necessitate the deindustrialisation of agriculture, factory manufacturing and mass media simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steam locomotive is ultimately a fetishisation of this sort of thinking — it is an analogue machine, complicated while comprehensible to the ordinary person (unlike, say, atomic energy or even gas-turbine locomotives). It is enormous and impressive, and also nostalgic for many Vekllei people. In a place and time where money did not matter, as it does not in Vekllei, and productivity was an afterthought, as it is in Vekllei, they make perfect sense. These ‘images’; of rural labour assisted by steam locomotives; of children growing up with these machines; of the constant fetishisation and decommodification of the world — these are currency in Vekllei. That is why this useless machine is a wonderful machine, and why a handful of steam locomotives mother their respective communities decades after their obsolescence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Tzipora. She goes by two names &amp;ndash; Tzipora, her birth name, and Zelda, a name she mistakenly thought sounded less Jewish. She lives in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/blqcwl/utopia_the_participatory_economy_of_vekllei/&#34;&gt;Lola&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/vekllei.city/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_0555.png?ssl=1&#34;&gt;Vekllei city-state&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an immigrant, she struggles with school but holds her own on in track and field, an inversion of her otherwise quiet and bookish nature. She is intimidated by pretty girls and can throw a half-decent punch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;genetic-freak&#34;&gt;Genetic Freak&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gregori babies, as they&amp;rsquo;re called, suffer from Gregori-Heitzfeld syndrome. It&amp;rsquo;s usually described as agelessness at menarche, since about 90% of cases are girls. It&amp;rsquo;s essentially a genetic malfunction that puts the body in a cycle of eternal growth &amp;ndash; they effectively continue to grow (without actually growing bigger), but do not develop and are more or less suspended at the onset of their first period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether they&amp;rsquo;re &amp;lsquo;mentally&amp;rsquo; children is an interesting one that there&amp;rsquo;s not a simple answer to. Their minds are not fully developed the way an adult human&amp;rsquo;s would be, since ageing stops in early teen-age years and before pubescence. They tend to retain some childish characteristics &amp;ndash; mostly decision-making and emotional control. But this sort of speculation risks dehumanising otherwise very functional and capable people. The effects of long-term childhood and social isolation are far more profound on the personality of a Gregori child than any biological limitation or squabbling about the teen-age/adult schism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boys can also have it, but are always hyperallergic and suffer from a broad anaphylaxis at onset of the condition (usually a little earlier, in early thelarche at 8-10y/o). It will almost always kill them. The discrepancy between the sexes is still being researched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Girls also have a risk of developing hyperallergies. Gregori babies have never developed cancers as far as anyone is aware, and these hyperallergies are a result of this hyperactive immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gregori babies fulfill the first of two miracles required for sainthood in the Catholic Church. In other parts of the world they are targets of violence as practicers of witchcraft or demonic pacts. The oldest Gregori baby, Tzipora Desmoines, is 120 years old and is set to overtake the human lifespan. She was 13th overall to have been diagnosed, but Gregori children have high mortality rates (largely violence, car accidents and suicides) and she is the first to pass 60 years of age. So, somewhat ironically, the children with speculated immortality almost always die young.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;knowing-her&#34;&gt;Knowing her&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of how Tzipora would be remembered would be in the way she appeared in the person. She was a good-looking young teen-ager of quiet and unusual movements. As she became known to the wider public, her physical appearance would come to define her as both a phenomena and disability — a victim of blessings; a sweet child of cotton and gingham carrying on in the dark schism between teen-age impetuosity and the adult world of &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt;. What a tragedy and miracle she was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zelda, which was how she introduced herself among friends, was as intricate as she was indecipherable. She had her own internal logics; a unique carousel of intuition that marked her out as some unfortunate &lt;em&gt;undamoispotet&lt;/em&gt; among other teen-agers. In conversation that stirred any emotion in her she was susceptible to spasmodic, defensive movements that distracted from her talking. Most frequently she would pull on her nose as if to wipe it, or reach for her shirt at the shoulder and adjust it. If she was particularly self-conscious, which could be brought on even by the spasms themselves, she would take hold of her shirt and keep her hand there, as though her thin girlish arms could shield her breast from judgement. She confided in her father that she did not like the tics. The more conscious of her imperfections she was, the more her idiosyncrasies flared. He asked her once how long she’d had them — the nose rubbings, the shirt pullings — and she said she couldn’t remember, but thought it might have been after she arrived in America. Which was possible, he supposed — trauma could bring on tics, even laymen knew that. If you spend a while with her, however, it becomes more obvious that her tics are symptomatic of a nervous, fidgety subconscious not cowed by the supposed tomboyishness of her movements — she jigs a leg, and run the back of her hand beneath her nose. Then, when she realises people notice those things and judge her for them, the same synchronistic hyperactivities became shirt-pulling and face-touching.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The participatory economy of Vekllei</title>

  Archived from the original article here
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint yellow&#34;&gt;
  ❖ This article predates the project, and &lt;strong&gt;should be considered non-canon&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestled between the regional tram offices and the pre-war Ferouistet Department Store, the Lola district is not known for much but her department store and good schools. It sits on the slope of the wide Vekllei capital basin, where the Atlantic can be seen from the street. It was Tzipora&amp;rsquo;s first home in Vekllei, and it was where she lived with her father. The schools were good, the kids were all right, and the trams were a gift from Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of Vekllei looks like Lola, marked by her mid-rise streets and public thermal ponds and geyser baths (named after the Vekllei village of Geyser, as it happens). Vekllei people do not generally own cars, and mostly commute via the metro, the exhaustive tram network or on occasion in a loan car from the autopool. The streets are narrow and empty of traffic save for service vehicles, and in the summers they are invaded by neighbourhood children playing baseball or seeking shade under the street trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lola is one of hundreds of neighbourhoods in the vast, densely-populated capital of the country from which it aquires its namesake. It is a city facing its past, now that there is plenty to eat and little to do &amp;ndash; and as a sprawling urban utopia with a fierce nostalgia for preindustrial life, there is no other place like it on Earth. Caught at once between the future of space and helijets, and her collective memories of agriculture and simple labour, Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s petticoat society marks a departure from futurism and a turn to its history, as though the violence and suffering and chaos of the past three centuries were but a chore obstructing utopia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;participatory-economics--property&#34;&gt;Participatory Economics &amp;amp; Property&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vekllei’s feminised parpolity, the revitalisation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://vekllei.city/religion/&#34;&gt;Upen&lt;/a&gt; brought about an ancient understanding of property reborn in the widespread poverty of Vekllei society following &lt;a href=&#34;https://vekllei.city/the-forgotten-generation/&#34;&gt;the first Atomic War&lt;/a&gt;. Widespead social regression and cross-generational nostalgia for preindustrial life took hold in urban Vekllei society almost immediately after the atomic fire, as the ruins of colonial and imperial society lay around the Vekllei people. The monarchy, a tokenistic and fashionable invention of the gilded Mercantile age just three centuries before, evaporated nearly overnight with the death of the king. So, too, did the military junta salivating over the charred remains of the capital find it nearly impossible to consolidate power in a city now without infrastructure. In the ashes of modern industrialisation grew tempered, atomised communities of streets and villages — the common council as we see it today. Food production returned to the city in the ruins of vast factories, wide canals were dug for unmotorised barges, and councils of working people organised self-interest in these communities, which would be understood a century later as &lt;em&gt;Sundress Municipalism&lt;/em&gt;. So too did the common understanding of property evaporate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old libertarian bugbear of the origins of property was revived — the population had been decimated, Vekllei people were surrounded by vast swaths of useless land of deceased ownership, and the institutions of old society had failed to retake power following the war. The question of ownership was pertinent, as it would clarify the sovereigns of future society. The sovereignty of Vekllei, as it would later be determined, is decentralised and portioned between any land-operating individual, local organisations, municiple councils, and syndicates. This tradition carries on today. In any one apartment building or row-house, you will find the inhabitants, building administrators, local councils and tenant unions exercising types of ownership over a space. In other words; residents of a home will have implied ownership over a home, but a community has implied ownership over the community itself. The intersection of different kinds of ownership result in complex and partially uncoded laws that, although vulnerable to beaurocratic and exhaustive legal disputes, are mostly discarded in place of local opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foundation of the Vekllei political and economic system is the community; a population larger than a single family and small enough to have valuable social bonds; a group of people bound by common living, work, and recreation. An unruly or criminal tenant is more likely to be run out of town by his neighbours than by the courts. This is not to misrepresent the daily conflicts of Vekllei domestic society — disputes are common and meaningless. But abuse of common ownership is tempered by the fact that it is quite impossible to evict any individual from his home without overwhelming agreement of his neighbours, essentially relegating formal council ownership to irrelevency; the true owners of any single home are, in practice, the community in which it is situated, supervised by protections offered under the local judicial councils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ownership of a factory is a lot more straightforward — the old mantra of the democratic workplace is more or less true here. Principally, unautomated (manned) factories recieve production requests from one of the hundreds of different economic bureaus keeping stock of production in the country, which otherwise do not directly supervise production except in circumstance of scarcity. Production requests are voluntary, and usually formalities in the production of items for local consumption. Heavily centralised industries, particularly heavy industries like raw product extraction and refining, usually operate under direct supervision of a bureau. Unions exist independently of the bureau system and usually hold membership from every worker of a factory, including managers. Mirroring nested councils, there are also larger industry unions that generally involve themselves only in general strikes and legal cases without precedent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ownership of a grocery store is clear and implied, if not codified. The person who manages and works the shop, either through implied property bonding (so-called ‘folk morality’; a phenomena largely dependent on the person’s social value and local consent) or familial tradition, owns the shop. These are not lawful protections of ownership — indeed, Vekllei common law says very little about senrouive business ownership — but in almost every case, they are validated by a community intuitively. Even antisocial or hostile shop-owners are rarely challenged on their right to the property they manage — the shop is, technically speaking, seen as an extension of the natural landscape (as no more than fired clay and timber), and the live-and-let-live culture in Vekllei is sympathetic to leaving people to their business and shop elsewhere. Legal disputes on the right to live above and manage a store are relatively rare, and usually resolved through ‘blood rights’ ( similar to ‘folk morality’) in the case of an individual or in a more democratic fashion involving multiple relevant complainants, like employees. In both of these examples, the disputed property is considered an entity itself with its own rights and interests extrapolated from its history and surrounding landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein remains the distinction between &lt;em&gt;venrouiva&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;senrouive&lt;/em&gt; property, and their implied ownership. &lt;em&gt;Venrouiva&lt;/em&gt; usually operate in cooperation with the product bureaus in the case of manufacturing, or other national organisations as their industry requires in education, medicine, power, water, etc. They are ultimately beholden to the direction of the country, as organised by the seats of power and politics. &lt;em&gt;Senrouive&lt;/em&gt; exists somewhat independent of the economy entirely, recieving mostly what it asks for and immersing their respective economies in the communities around them. Although all physical material in Vekllei is ultimately property of the country (a vague, naturalistic construct seen as distinct from the government, at least in a Western understanding), &lt;em&gt;senrouive&lt;/em&gt;will almost never be managed directly by larger unions or administrative bodies. This distinction does little to articulate public and private ownership, as the very concept of property remains formally unacknowledged in the economy in the country. Instead, all business today is conducted in cooperation with the ideas of community, implied ownership, self-interest and some sort of idea of supply and demand largely usurped by post-scarcity and widespread automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, Vekllei does not actually consider itself classless — Indeed, &lt;em&gt;venrouiva&lt;/em&gt; are fundamentally a coordinating class of workers that are atomised from &lt;em&gt;senrouive&lt;/em&gt; work through their power and decision-making. They are a class of power in law, education, science, medicine, and politics, and consequently, guide the direction of the country. Although even &lt;em&gt;senrouive&lt;/em&gt; business is still fundamentally worker-owned and managed (as part of Sundress Municipalism), this hierarchy remains in principle, even if the quality of life of &lt;em&gt;venrouiva&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;senrouive&lt;/em&gt; workers is in practice identical. This fact is rarely acknowledged outside of technical circles in the country, because it matters very little to the common Vekllei person. Vekllei is not outwardly egalitarian, despite practice, and the problems of power are mitigated by a mess of democratic structures ultimately enslaved to self-interested, independent communities of people. For one of the most centralised countries in the world, with a homogenous ethnic people and culture, Vekllei is better described as hundreds of thousands of hamlets than a single city.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Littlest Goddess in Pachinki</title>

  Archived from the original article here
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint yellow&#34;&gt;
  ❖ This article predates the project, and &lt;strong&gt;should be considered non-canon&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Palace Gods live in decadence in an isolated and incestuous land above the mortal planes called the Palace. They do not eat and will live forever, provided they stay within the gardens of the Palace and consummate their industrial godhood occasionally with &lt;em&gt;domen&lt;/em&gt;, an opium that they believe purifies blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult Palace Gods are almost entirely women, but birthrates of boys and girls are about equal. At the onset of puberty, boys can enter rituals to become female gods, but sexual pleasure will stain their transition and thus &lt;em&gt;romentet&lt;/em&gt; (as they’re called in god-tongue) will never maintain blood parity with female Palace Gods. Boys who enter sexual acts or allow sexual thoughts will not transition correctly and instead be consigned to serfdom for the rest of their lives (and in the impurities of their blood, they will be dead by forty).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intersection of the Palace hierarchy and immortality mean that adult Palace Gods are terrified of deposition by younger generations. Older gods will often take an oath of chastity or, failing that, attempt to sabotage the blood purity of god-children to ensure they do not grow up to threaten their positions of power. Adult women often enter relationships with boys for this reason, which will prevent their transition and rise to power and instead grant them mortality. Young girls, however, cannot be dispossessed of their powers so easily. Homosexuality is strictly forbidden in the Palace, and so girls are often tricked into destroying their potential in rituals known as &lt;em&gt;bloodfits&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As inhabitants of the Palace do not need to eat, it means that they do not consume the souls of other creatures. According to their own tapestry myth, their spiritual veganism has come to be a core lifestyle on which godhood is predicated. Young goddesses are often curious about mortal pleasures like food and body functions, and so particularly manipulative adult gods will trick them into eating meat and thus consuming the soul of another creature. After the meat is consumed (the quantity rarely matters, so long as the goddess in general understands they have eaten it), their sin is revealed to them and that knowledge sparks a spiritual crisis in the young goddess that collapses their powers and their physical presence in the Palace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where they go is unknown to anyone still living in the Palace — to those unfortunate girls tricked into bloodfit, they find themselves in a land not quite Pachinki (the mortal planet) or the Palace (the central harbour for gods). Instead, there exists a realm constructed of young gods’ ideas of what mortal life might be like, complete with the idealism and fear of the unknown beyond their Palace lifestyles. They begin to breathe for the first time — a terrifying experience to a goddess previously unused to it — and will experience weather, texture, and sunlight for the first time. Their clothes will suddenly have weight, and their wings are now vestigial relics of magic-aided flight. Many girls simply pass out, unable to deal with the shock of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most stories here end happily though, in a trend unusual for Pachinki and the Palace. The in-between world these goddesses find themselves in is constructed of their hope and curiosity of Pachinki, too. Green pastures of stunning colour and flower-meadows straight out of their wildest fantasies are never far away. A community of ex-goddesses actively look for new girls and help them integrate into the material world. With time, the Palace life simply doesn’t compare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uloah, pictured here, is one of the most recent goddesses to be tricked into committing bloodfit. She was unwittingly fed her own pet peacock, and ended up in the salt lakes of the in-between realm. Any god trying to eat for the first time is a messy affair. After a day of desperate tears and despair as she wandered aimlessly, she came across two beautiful goddesses about her age in Palace clothes. They took her to a village with homes made of long grass populated entirely by her kin. A life of pressures and treachery in the Palace was replaced with the simple pleasures of quiet agriculture and play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is so much of the magic of the Palace Gods predicated on myth and tradition? After all, it is not a potion or gemstone that strips goddesses of their power. The truth of it, understood by very few and acknowledged by fewer, is that the Palace Gods are sustained entirely by their own myth, with no future or past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Princess Torah, the revolutionary ex-goddess that would eventually liberate the mortal Pachinki from the Palace, said as such in her early writings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Palace Gods are not gods because of bloodlines, despite their insistence. They will tell you it is hereditary, and that blood is colloquial for purity, but they are misunderstanding their own myths. They preach immortality, but can be slaughtered like failing livestock if you’d only realise it. They are not gods because they are better equipped to employ ancient magic, or because they have unlocked the secret of eternal life. They are gods because they’ve fallen for the fiction that sustains them — they are monarchs because they believe in the monarchy, they are cruel because they believe in cruelty, and they subjugate because that is how they’ve read the elaborate tapestry their ancestors constructed. So when Princess Moswen, my martyr and humanist sister (rest her soul), descended to the human people and addressed them universally without regard to race or subcontinent, she called the Gods what they were — tokens writing simultaneously their past and future, failing their own present. Waxen, pastel nepotists misunderstanding their fiction as constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&amp;mdash;-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pachinki isn&amp;rsquo;t a normal constructed world. It has its own canon. It is a creation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://vekllei.city/category/character/&#34;&gt;Tzipora&lt;/a&gt;, who is the character utopia of my worldbuilding project. Soon after she moves to &lt;a href=&#34;https://vekllei.city/category/landscape/&#34;&gt;Vekllei&lt;/a&gt;, she&amp;rsquo;s pretty friendless and surrounded by pulpy paperback novels. Pachinki is sort of a worldbuilding project within a worldbuilding project, and it belongs to her.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Mineral Lake starts absorbing Grief in Pachinki</title>

&lt;p&gt;Rena’s little boy was found in the closest town with his guts turned out and his throat cut. They didn’t tell it to Rena like that, but that’s what happened to him. His village and people, the &lt;em&gt;Lehmanen&lt;/em&gt;, are descendants of Palace Gods forced out of the heavens some millennia ago over their refusal to smoke &lt;em&gt;Domen&lt;/em&gt;, a sort of opium of the Gods and essential practice in the Palace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As descendants of Palace Gods, many still carry birthstones in their bodies — small gems buried in the heart of the gut, beneath the stomach. These birthstones are very powerful magical artefacts and fetch a high price in Pachinki’s larger and less magical kingdoms. Rena’s little boy, who was not yet ten, had been taken by pirates looking for his stone and killed. The great tragedy of it was that he was fathered by a man from Zen — the boy had not inherited a birthstone from his mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was her only child and she’d been widowed in the war. The chief of their village announced a month of mourning and fasting in his memory. Once the period had passed, life went on. Rena resumed work in the mineral swamps in which Lehmanen live. The roots and algae that grow in these waters sustain communal village life and produce potions of medicinal value, including leprosy and tuberculosis vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two months after the murder of her only child, Rena came across a stone that struck her dumb with shock. It was her boy’s face, unmistakeable in the perfection of the diorite, caught in the terror and pain of his final moments. It hadn’t been there the month before. She waded over to it but found no other indication of its origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That boy was only the first. As more people died, and the village went through its cycles of joy and grief, the swamp slowly began to fill with the forms of the dead. Heads of the fog. The Lehmanen were confused and angry by the insensitivity of the mineral swamp, and couldn’t understand why it was happening. Something was intercepting the quiet grief of these isolated people and resurrecting the memory of the dead. Was it the minerals? The wind? Something beneath the waters? Was it even a phenomena so simple as to assign to a single force of nature?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly a year after the death of Rena’s little boy, another head appeared, joining dozens already hidden in the fog of the mineral swamps. This one was identical to the diorite totems before it. But it was unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one was of Rena — and she was very much alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous posts &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/ar8jov/a_gem_girl_shows_off_her_enormous_strength_in/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/user/MelonKony/comments/azmu94/the_palace_gods_attempt_to_retrieve_their_runaway/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pachinki pangea is home to six subcontinents of old magic, mostly inherited from the Palace Gods, who are worshipped by urban centres to this day. The Lem subcontinent is sparsely populated, as the minerals of its many swamps are rife with disease (an illness contracted here, of which there are many, are called plaguentart in Lem or honeydeath in the Zen tongue).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lem are ignorant of the much older magic of the swamps, which predates perhaps even the Palace itself. As stupid to it as they are ultraviolets, the people of Pachinki can only react to the manifestations of it, and will never harness the raw, low-frequency power of ancient harmonics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Footnotes —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pachinki is the creation of a fourteen-year-old girl in my world, &lt;a href=&#34;https://vekllei.city&#34;&gt;Vekllei&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Pachinki occasionally lurches into horror otherwise incongruous with the sweet fantasy Tzipora shows such affection for. Pachinki may be a world of peace and wonder, but just like Tzipora’s own present utopian surrounds, it belies a historical context of starvation, mass graves and political violence. Part of the wonder of Pachinki, looking back, is that Tzipora seemed keenly aware of the prohibitively dark nature of this kind of violence in her otherwise escapist whimsy, and this maternal turbulence with her own work is so obvious that even the most casual reader will be conscious of its inconsistency. A page about the pleasure of tasting fruit gems will pirouette into musings on the use of slavery in their procurement and the sabotaging of their production to justify conquest and war. The surreal dissonance of her own motivations for creating Pachinki reflect a girl who was herself living a surreal, contradictory existence — at her time of writing, she was living in a land of plenty and peace, where just a year before she was nearly killed after grocers in Cherry started poisoning their food waste to drive away homeless and vagrants. Her own existence was one of startling contrast — a rapid transition to petticoat society from the misery of the American South, where she witnessed indiscriminate slaughter, sexual violence and crippling poverty. Whatever hurts is real, and so Vekllei did not feel real to her — and consequently, Pachinki is suspended in the same internal turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pachinki isn&amp;rsquo;t a normal constructed world. It has its own canon. It is a creation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://vekllei.city/category/character/&#34;&gt;Tzipora&lt;/a&gt;, who is the character utopia of my worldbuilding project.

      <title>A Celebration of all Women across the World</title>

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://vekllei.city/introducing-landscape/&#34;&gt;Vekllei&lt;/a&gt; on the first of each May, the women’s councils and industrial unions wipe clean their banners and flags and join great parades that regale the main streets of the city with song and colour. They carry flags and banners in celebration of womanhood and remembrance of the dead — for those Potter’s Fields and unmarked graves that intern nameless women across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They walk in universal solidarity but not without local identity — women’s unions, called chapels, number themselves. Here Local Chapel № 23, represented mostly by a half-dozen families and a few generations, make their way to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/vekllei.city/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_0555.png?ssl=1&#34;&gt;Little Vekllei prefecture&lt;/a&gt;, where the day’s march will take them back to the heart of the city. Little Lili leads the charge with confetti, while her sisters, mother and grandmother follow. They will find it difficult to fit the flags on the streetcar. Her bespectacled sister Patet is sickly and this is the first time she&amp;rsquo;s left the house in five days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://vekllei.city/the-forgotten-generation/&#34;&gt;catastrophe of the first atomic war&lt;/a&gt; had set in motion what no protest or revolution ever had — a cleansing of the political and cultural landscape, and a rebirth of Vekllei traditional culture and reestablishment of &lt;a href=&#34;https://vekllei.city/religion/&#34;&gt;Upen&lt;/a&gt; in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a day where the men shower the precious women of their lives with gifts and affection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Vekllei is not necessarily a progressive country, and is often a land of absurd contradiction in Western political tradition, Vekllei women enjoy a society built for them. And really built for them too, on an infrastructural level. Womanhood in the country is not defined by commodity or appearance, but by superficially humanist ideas the culture associates with womanhood &amp;ndash; compassion, bravery, intelligence, grace, etc. They are defined not by their relationships or their economic circumstance, but by their friends, political opinions, ability, etc. The decommodification of society has also decommodified womanhood. Vekllei is not simply a good place to be a woman, but is in fact a female country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;let me know if you have any questions!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vekllei.city&#34;&gt;www.vekllei.city&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/melon.kony/&#34;&gt;insta&lt;/a&gt; fer more&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She could feel the wind rising. The horizon beyond was warped, caught in the distortion of a forested planetoid before them. The morning sun cast a honeyed warmth on her wings of black sugar, which sang like wind chimes as she soared high above the gem deserts below. Hyssop, her new and only friend, followed her ungracefully under the spell of his flystone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chill caught her skull and traced her veins to her stomach, where it seized up. She felt the strength go from her wings and the world tilt out of focus. Her body plummeted, her figure limp, and Hyssop yelled out at her, “Princess! Tora! What’s wrong?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her wings trailed her as she fell from the sky, and he dived after her. The sparkle of the sand blinded them as the gems rose into view. They hit the dune in a plume of rubies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She awoke and emerged from his arms. He was beneath her, dazed in the crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hyssop!” She screamed. “Hyssop, I’m sorry! Wake up—!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She cried out again when she noticed two men in fine suits watching over them, like kites and carrion. Hyssop was wrenched from his dreams by her scream and scrambled to his feet. He turned to her seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t move,” he told her calmly. “Don’t talk to them. Don’t even look at them. Just watch the flystone in my hand, Tora. Look at my hand and the sky. Look, the planetoids are out in their brilliance. Look at their oceans, Tora.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She looked over the shoulder of the dune and faced the planetoids, but her thoughts were with him. She could admire nothing in her fear. Her knees and palms were pitted with gems and wept blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hyssop,” she whispered from the corner of her mouth, her face in the sun. A whimper caught in her throat and it coloured her voice. “What are those men?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Henchmen of the Palace Gods. They’re looking for you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ll kill myself, before I go back. I belong among the living.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No-one will do anything,” he said. He sounded undisturbed. He reached behind himself and felt out for her hand, and she seized it and held it tight to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t acknowledge them,” he said, staring the henchmen down. “They are not among the living. Do not speak to them, or you’ll bring them here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Okay. What do you want me to do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Look at the sky. Think of us in Rose, by the sea. That’s where we’re going, when we leave this dune.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never been to the sea,” she said. “That’s where you said you were from, isn’t it? Rose?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sure, Rose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve only seen it from the heavens. I want to see it as a girl.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’ll see it. We’ll just have to wait for the henchmen to be recalled, first.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Princess Tora, Part II, Pachinki Codex&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is an excerpt from the book &lt;em&gt;Outside Looking In&lt;/em&gt;, as prefaced by media analyst and outsider art historian Roy Tesmein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author herself, Tzipora Desmoines, would usually describe the henchmen of the Palace Gods as ‘Pinkerton’ — a sort of brutal thug for hire that dealt with asset retrieval and strikebreaking. Of course, the henchmen come from the heavens and are summoned for singular purposes, usually surveillance or sabotage. Tzipora was always very clear on the limitations of the Palace Gods, and their struggles to enter the mortal world, a weakness that inhibited the successful recapture of their runaway princess, Tora. In fact, Tora’s ability to enter the mortal world without the collapse of her mind, as dictated by the schism between planes, was more shocking in itself than her youthful betrayal. In many ways, Tora is a self-insert that witnesses much of the tragedy Tzipora had to come to terms with and rationalise in her early years in the American South. In this context, the Pinkerton moniker makes sense in Tzipora’s mind — just as Tora later attempts to organise Pachinki into a revolt against the Gods (with brutal suppression on the part of the henchmen), Tzipora herself witnessed bloody strikebreaking several times as she rode freight trains on Southern Pacific, a freight company that experienced violent industrial action shortly before its bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And further;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Pachinki occasionally lurches into horror otherwise incongruous with the sweet fantasy Tzipora shows such affection for. Pachinki may be a world of peace and wonder, but just like Tzipora’s own present utopian surrounds, it belies a historical context of starvation, mass graves and political violence. Part of the wonder of Pachinki, looking back, is that Tzipora seemed keenly aware of the prohibitively dark nature of this kind of violence in her otherwise escapist whimsy, and this maternal turbulence with her own work is so obvious that even the most casual reader will be conscious of its inconsistency. A page about the pleasure of tasting fruit gems will pirouette into musings on the use of slavery in their procurement and the sabotaging of their production to justify conquest and war. The surreal dissonance of her own motivations for creating Pachinki reflect a girl who was herself living a surreal, contradictory existence — at her time of writing, she was living in a land of plenty and peace, where just a year before she was nearly killed after grocers in Cherry started poisoning their food waste to drive away homeless and vagrants. Her own existence was one of startling contrast — a rapid transition to petticoat society from the misery of the American South, where she witnessed indiscriminate slaughter, sexual violence and crippling poverty. Whatever hurts is real, and so Vekllei did not feel real to her — and consequently, Pachinki is suspended in the same internal turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  Archived from the original article here
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint yellow&#34;&gt;
  ❖ This article predates the project, and &lt;strong&gt;should be considered non-canon&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hundred years ago, the fortress existed as a spectre of the neighbouring villages; a beast of suffering and woe with fingers deep into the mountains around &lt;a href=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/vekllei.city/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_0555.png?ssl=1&#34;&gt;Montre&lt;/a&gt;. In the waning days of the military junta, the beast’s creators, the Sugarhouse Fort served as a strategic command centre for Vekllei’s nuclear arsenal and a blacksite to disappear the most prolific and dangerous agitators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fort was not finished when the bombs fell, and it sat abandoned for a half-century as the scorched fragments of &lt;a href=&#34;https://vekllei.city/introducing-landscape/&#34;&gt;Vekllei society&lt;/a&gt; were preoccupied with &lt;a href=&#34;https://vekllei.city/the-forgotten-generation/&#34;&gt;their total devastation&lt;/a&gt;. It was not until Vekllei’s reemergence as a great power, and one that was convinced of an imminent nuclear war, that the Fort was reoccupied as one of the largest buried forts in the world, rivalled only by the Moscow Metro complex and Cheyenne Mountain’s extensions in the late 2080s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fort is no longer a spectre of the nearby villages — in fact, commute between them is so regular that a special railway has been installed into the heart of the fort, where many thousands of locals work as labourers, switchboard operators, engineers, administrators and research scientists. The fort houses Vekllei’s international telephone exchange, her largest geothermal research outfit attached to Montre University, Vekllei’s nuclear command buried deep in the ganglia of the fort, the auxiliary national railway control, Vekllei’s fourth-largest nuclear shelter system, and many other bureaus of national importance that have been relocated away from the capital city in fear of their destruction there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-frequency telephonics and radar suck so much power that they would cause blackouts in nearby towns if they were both activated at the same time. As a modern all-electric fort with complex electrified munitions transport systems and pumps, her power plants are modern and overhauled every decade or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two supercritical hydrothermic geothermal power plants at opposite ends of the fort operate as primary sources of power. In other countries they would be prohibitively expensive &amp;ndash; high-temperature geothermal sources have a high failure rate and require extraordinarily complex infrastructure to construct. These two plants (&lt;em&gt;Suzie East&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ame West)&lt;/em&gt; have wells nearly five kilometres deep (just over 16,100ft), and capitalise on the plate margins of the European and American tectonic plates, which Vekllei straddles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fort is inherently outdated in an age of thermonuclear weaponry (although her shelters deep below the Earth are estimated to be impenetrable even to several direct strikes), but Vekllei is not a large country and the viability of mobilised command for civilian bureaus, like that found U.S. and the Soviet Union, is limited. The country has an affection for infrastructure, a fact of no surprise to anyone who has been there, and it is the size of the fort, and its decentralised network of tunnels throughout much of the Montre-Sugarhouse mountain range, that serve as primary defences in the face of a second nuclear war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image here is a &amp;lsquo;pocket&amp;rsquo; telegram signed with love. The fort is one of the largest construction projects of the last two centuries, and is a point of pride among the people of the North. In all their agrarian and peaceful living, Sugarhouse Fort has no equal in anything in the industrious South of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We best know &lt;a href=&#34;https://vekllei.city/introducing-landscape/&#34;&gt;Vekllei&lt;/a&gt; as a dense society of utopia and great infrastructure today, but there was blood in that crucible. It is difficult to imagine that only fifty years ago these streets were unpaved and impassible with the rubble of old society. Shadows on concrete marked the souls lost in the arrogance of the monarchy. The nuclear fire was pregnant with a new generation of people, who, in the principles of &lt;a href=&#34;https://vekllei.city/religion/&#34;&gt;upen&lt;/a&gt;, would forge a new society out of the ruins of the old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then girl’s shirts weren’t made of cotton and  you wore holes in your shoes. He was part of the &lt;em&gt;budoinetnoikotet&lt;/em&gt;, or the ‘war children’. His parents had lived through the first atomic war, and he was the born in the shadow of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that time the currency had completely collapsed, and so people traded within their own communities in an awkward return to preindustrial life. Often, people’s best clothes were their uniforms, and so that was what they took photos in. This photo sits on the commode in the living room, next to a vase of lilies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He remembered sour details of his teen-age impetuosity. How he insisted he remove his glasses for the photo, insulting his bespectacled father in doing so. How his mother argued with his sister over the appropriate length of her fountain hairpiece. The women wore their family &lt;em&gt;gi&lt;/em&gt;, ceremonial quarter-pleats, and he&amp;rsquo;d had his hair cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He thought a lot about his sister, Amelie. She was beautiful and clever and had a weird sense of humour. He’d loved her a lot. She confided in him as teen-agers— about problems with friends, her rampant insecurities, her dreams of the future. It turned out she’d had a beast in her lungs and it took her when she was fifteen. That was how it went back then, in the poverty of the city. To think a hundred years earlier tuberculosis had been a rumour. That is what war does to a country. He was not even afforded the dignity of anger. The English had been right to bomb them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life was different now, of course. Vekllei was strong, and although he was not much wealthier, there was more to be had. The country had flourished in the ruins of the old society. Now he watches his own child sport the uniform his sister once wore, and when she smiles at him she looks like Amelie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vekllei developed rapidly in the face of total destruction. In the space of fifty years the country consolidated infrastructure and its rural population into a powerful city-state of autonomous, rugged agrarian hamlets,  they themselves flowers of the extinct monarchy and  military junta. In some ways it was an exciting time to be alive &amp;ndash; there was now plenty to be had. No-one was hungry. But the children of those interim years have almost been erased from common memory entirely, as bastards of Vekllei&amp;rsquo;s story of utopia and violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She loved helping out. It was important to her, as an ageless girl of ultimately transient relationships, to be able to establish for herself a family wherever she lived. So within a few years of her arrival in Vekllei, she put time in as a warden for her apartment block and undertook the medical training that went with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She carried debts of blood because of how she sold out her friends some years before. She was very conscious of the fact that she was living as a traitor to her old friends. If she was going to die in a nuclear blast — so be it. It would finally be repaid. She had lived a wonderful life these last couple years and had made good use of her borrowed time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the war did come, as she always had suspected it would, she was prepared to die in it. She was caught outside when the bomb hit Montre, and when it failed to kill her, she spent three days searching tirelessly for wounded with the rest of the Civil Defense corps. It was only when her legs gave out that she made the long journey back to her father in the capital, to reassure him that she was in fact still alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was awarded for her efforts, along with two others from Montre-Lola. It cemented her place as grandmother of the small agricultural village; the quite librarian from the city who had only the village’s interests at heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole world gives way to a moment of silence. The other seasons are filled with noise and marrow, jerking and twisting with the pace of the clock. But a moment lasts forever — and wintertime is one long moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the uniforms got heavier and the commutes longer, Zelda would always like the wintertime. Even in the writhing digits of the city — the subways, the streetcars, the dockyards — snowbanks took the noise. There’s no hurry that time of year. Your feet are wet and your ears hurt, but that’s the price of liberation — to have normal productivity disrupted, usual play moved away. For one long moment — that’s winter — you can spent a while outdoors alone in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A gem girl shows off her enormous strength in Pachinki</title>
      <link>https://beta.millmint.net/posts/2019-02-16-gem/</link>

  Archived from the original article here
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;book-hint yellow&#34;&gt;
  ❖ This article predates the project, and &lt;strong&gt;should be considered non-canon&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subcontinent of &lt;strong&gt;Zen&lt;/strong&gt; on the &lt;strong&gt;Pachinki pangea&lt;/strong&gt; is so weathered by enormous gem deserts that there is scarcely enough space to grow wheat for bread. In places where the soil is too thin for heavy wheats, sparrowgrass is grown. This grass has large heads that can be eaten raw and taste citrusy and acidic as they only grow in toxic soils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Battered by gem storms, where holy winds pick up stones from the deserts and scatter them, the people of Zen live a hard and honest life. They have forsaken Palace Gods, and have consequently lost a lot of their fertility. Since marriage is dissolved upon failure of a child, Zen has many lonely and desperate spinsters. Driven nearly mad by their childlessness, it is possible to give birth to ‘gem children’ by crushing certain magic gemstones and consuming that powder with normal edible fruit gems. After a short labour of about a month, an extraordinarily painful pregnancy precedes a dangerous birth that kills about half of gem-pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The child is undeniably beautiful — with a perfect colour and a glitter like no other, gem children are otherwise just like you or me. They usually find themselves popular among other village children as objects of wonder. In poorer Zen regions beyond the large wheat kingdoms, they are targets for pirates who whisk them away in airships and sell them to slavers on mainland Pachinki, since gem children are prized as well-groomed, beautiful servants of the aristocracy. This is somewhat misguided, as the majority of gem children that live in Zen live an unglamorous, happy life in agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are extremely strong — with nearly no limit to their ability to push and crush — but are easily threatened by frequencies that shatter gems. One can easily hold themselves up with a single finger. They move gracefully though and have universally fine motor skills, so they have never harmed a fleshed human unintentionally. Grace here is caught mid-leap to a single handstand. With her fine balance and limitless energy, she could stay there forever if she chooses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gem children are kept alive by love, and as long as they are loved by someone — their mother, the community, friends — they will live forever. They also grow up, and stop physically ageing in their early twenties. Tragically, many gem children that are kidnapped die soon after as they are thrust into unloving environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Married gem children often move abroad with their partners, since their appearance makes them popular fortune-tellers, spell-casters or oath-breakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gem deserts are mesmerising and a joy to wander, but you must only walk with a low sun or at night. Even in a bright moonlight, the brilliance of the gems can easily blind you for days, sometimes forever. They symbolise Zen as a people and as a landscape, and are one of the oldest shifting monuments on Pachinki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pachinki isn&amp;rsquo;t a normal constructed world. It has its own canon. It is a creation of&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://vekllei.city/category/character/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tzipora&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, who is the character utopia of my worldbuilding project. Soon after she moves to&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://vekllei.city/category/landscape/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vekllei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, she&amp;rsquo;s pretty friendless and surrounded by pulpy paperback novels. Pachinki is sort of a worldbuilding project within a worldbuilding project, and it belongs to her.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;you can check my reddit profile (and there&amp;rsquo;s a follow button there now, because reddit is Facebook) for more posts about Vekllei and Tzipora. This isn&amp;rsquo;t the last you&amp;rsquo;ll see of Pachinki, not by a long shot!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even for those ageless kids, there’s a time when the charade of childhood comes to a head and begs a certain uncomfortable question: at what point does the whole thing — of immaturity, of carelessness, of sleepovers — start looking like two old women posturing around youth, indulging in a sick genetic perversion? At what age to they stop brushing each other’s hair and buying magazines?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question wasn’t phrased like that, but it was there. And though they had a good time, it weighed heavy on them as the schism between their innocent intuition and their public appearance grew wider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of sundress municipalism, Vekllei’s villages and townships are mostly self-sufficient and self-regulating. Although a walk in the capital will take you past colossal apartment blocks and cinemas, libraries and schools of great magnificence, you are really looking at a hundred different communities going about personal business at their leisure. The villages are large and concrete now, but the people are are still there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So does it surprise anyone that the police are just as much caregivers as law enforcement? That’s the thing about cultural matriarchy — even old moustachioed crustaceans like Teddy Roresoin here are mothers in the consciousness of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teddy came from shipbuilders and he was desperate to avoid becoming his parents. He enlisted in the Navy, but at university his politics soured on dying in some hole in Taiwan and he returned to his seaside prefecture. His office in the station overlooks the dry dock where his parents once worked. In his day it birthed large trawlers of fatty Atlantic salmon. Today it makes nuclear submarines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He didn’t mean to have a child, much less a daughter, and she turned out to be everything he was terrified of. In Vekllei, they are called ‘&lt;em&gt;Lodoinopotet&lt;/em&gt;’, which fits into English best as ‘woman-girls’ or &amp;lsquo;girly girl&amp;rsquo;. It evokes a specific image — a high-school girl with modified uniform, enamoured by useless trinkets like perfume and rouge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May, his daughter, was not always close with her father but her mother did not stick around long and so it was how it was. She did not intend to become a police officer in school. She spent most of her schooling life having her heart broken by a whirlwind of paper friendships and easy boyfriends. With no qualifications and mediocre grades, she asked her father for a job. She found out she liked it, and the people she policed liked her, too. These days she patrols their hometown together with her father, killing time and making friends. She used to wear makeup heavy like the inner-city girls. She was ashamed of a beauty mark near her mouth. Nowadays it doesn’t bother her much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of her favourite of the town’s children is Laura and her brother Rike, which is a brutish-sounding name but he’s a sweet boy. He loves her dad and her father lets him wear his officer’s cap. May’s pushing thirty now and her father’s on the winter side of fifty, and her worries of marrying right out of school are far behind her now — she has enough children to fill a village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story might be saccharine, but that’s what no crime and community policing does to constable. It takes these masculine warriors of a community and makes them mums. Vekllei people’d have it no other way. At once therapists, negotiators, friends and guardians, the community police of Vekllei are symptomatic of the wider feminisation of Vekllei society, and their ambition to crest the final age of industry and enter a peaceful, post-industrial epoch of rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, I like questions. If you&amp;rsquo;re new to Vekllei you can check out a website I worked quite hard on: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.veklleei.city&#34;&gt;www.vekllei.city&lt;/a&gt;. Or check out my profile! I&amp;rsquo;ve written on &lt;em&gt;Senrouiva&lt;/em&gt;  and &lt;em&gt;Venrouiva&lt;/em&gt; policing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/99nhx6/the_constabulary/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/a7ltvy/the_suburban_constabulary/&#34;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bastard ate the lettuce! There&amp;rsquo;s a hole in the wire!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s cute but he&amp;rsquo;s a bastard!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been drawing a train for over two weeks now and I needed to draw something alive before I shinkansenned myself. This only took an hour or two but I&amp;rsquo;m not drawing enough and it feels like I&amp;rsquo;m running out of time to get good at drawing.&lt;/p&gt;
