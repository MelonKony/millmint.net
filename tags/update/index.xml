      <description>Archived from the original article here  ðŸŒ¼ Featured in the Atlantic
This article appeared in Issue #6 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.  Hi everyone,
&amp;ldquo;He not busy being born is busy dying,&amp;rdquo; â€” thatâ€™s off a Bob Dylan bootleg. Iâ€™ve just finished my thesis and Iâ€™m busy being born again. Sometimes I feel like Iâ€™m busy dying. Drawingâ€™s been the way out for a long time now.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  ðŸŒ¼ Featured in the Atlantic
This article appeared in Issue #4 of the Atlantic Bulletin. You can read it here.  Hello,
Iâ€™m Hobart. Iâ€™ve been working on this project for a while now. It doesnâ€™t really have a purpose or an end goal â€” I just want to draw and write about nice things, and Iâ€™m learning a lot on the way.</description>

      <description>Archived from the original article here  Hello everyone. Just a little update.
As a way of thanking my Patrons, Iâ€™m taking some time over the next two weeks or so to create a little set of Tzipora postcards and send them out as gifts.
How many cards will the set contain?
 Iâ€™m aiming for about six cards.
 How much money would you need to have forked over to get some?</description>

      <title>Hobart and Tzipora are off to Japan</title>

      <description>Archived from the original article here   Tzipora here is wearing a simplified form of Veklleiâ€™s national dress, which plays fast and loose with lace and showcases some of Veklleiâ€™s more decadent iconography. Long gi (decorative quarter-pleats youâ€™ve seen around) accompany sun petticoats, or Vekllei lace aprons. Flowers take the place of astrology or the Zodiac in Vekllei, and so they often accompany spiritual runes (in upotenne, or religious script) about the girl.</description>
